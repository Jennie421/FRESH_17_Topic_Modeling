3,so today um was okay woke up kind of late which was nice but then went to breakfast at around 900 so it was the end kind of the end of when um breakfast is being served and went out just by myself and then got my food and sat down with girl from my entryway and so we talked little bit but then she ended up um getting up and going 'cause she had somewhere to go so then was sitting there kinda eating my food just by myself and don't know just know it don't like really matter but being just eating by myself was was just bored and was sad that nobody that didn't like know anybody to come sit by but then ended up on my way out saw one of my other friends and sat with him and didn't even have anything to eat anymore but we just sat and chatted for while it was nice then we decided to go to spin class which was really fun so we went at 1215 it was great to do that workout and after that felt felt really good and then um we went to lunch and then went to the uh meeting where got my watch um and then so after that was feeling good 'cause was like yes get to do this new thing where get to participate in study just worked out so feel good and then um like changed came back changed and then went to um went to go shopping with some friends that was really fun that we got to hang out but then had to find some like white pants or white shorts because i'm going to black convocation tomorrow and hate spending money but did and got some white shorts and by the end was just tired think it was just because like going to the mall is tiring you're walking around and there is people there and yeah just lot of people it just tiring so guess in that sense i'm pretty introverted uh but then we got back oh we um we went to there was some activities fair that was extremely overwhelming because there was so many people had no idea of like what to even do and then started like thinking just saw like bunch of people there and so guess like have weird body issues but went and um saw bunch of guys there that thought was like really attractive or even like somewhat attractive and just felt like it was more attractive than am because don't have some objective view of like how actually look and so then that just made me thinking about how i'm different from other guys and then how i'm different from other straight guys and how it don't wanna hang out with me and then that had me thinking about like the black men forum which it was holding dance tonight and just how like we have nothing in common and they're pretty like homophobic and they're just overtly masculine so just don't mix well with him and then like started thinking about that and we went to the the bmf dance the rush hour dance and then just like being around all of that people was just kind of stressing me out so was really tired and then um we finally left which was good um but now i'm in bed and i'm feeling better that i'm in bed and don't have to deal with other people 
4,so today um was an okay day woke up kind of later which was nice and ended up finishing my book which actually felt like really good because that meant that can actually like finish book in time even before like class started so um still have like half week until the book was actually due that really nice that like know that can get it done so that was good um and then after that actually had to have lunch with one of my well air quote friends because she had been irritating um me and an of my other friends lately just because um she like annoying and crazy person um so basically we was like trying to say to her that we still wanna be friends with you but you can be we can say you can be irritating sometimes but we was like we we for me to ha-hang out with you we need you to be more like calm and understanding and be able to listen to me when we actually need you to listen to me and so it was it seemed like it was well-rece well-received until later but i'll get to that in sec then we had black convocation which was really really good um and it was great to go to that except that afterwards we had dinner and um um we had dinner and then there was these other like guys who came up to me and started talking there it was definitely homophobic so it was kind of hard to it was not hard but it was stressful to deal with her um and then just throughout the day was having like bad body images and or body images stuff and felt bad ab felt didn't look attractive es-especially compared to other person so that didn't make me feel good but then went and hang out with one of my other friends and then we went to like an parties and we started drinking little bit and it felt good um and then met back up with my other friends and it was saying how that person who we had the lunch with the one who was like air quote friends was um she actually tried to like she was like grinding on and dancing with one of um with the guys that my other friends liked so it got like super pissed at her and then so she is basically she we was in group chat with her these girl and the girl left the group chat so apparently it feel it feel bad that things kind of ended badly like that but one wasn't participating in it and two it seems like that was bound to happen just because like my it we just didn't mix well but i'm back and i'm feeling okay and i'm tired so hopefully i'll go to bed and sleep through the night 
5,um so today was better day went out with this one guy to breakfast and he bought me breakfast and we had good talk about like bsa and stuff and how they've been exclusive and bmf and different ways that we can change things it was really nice today because also it was kind of rainy which was made it pretty day then went out to lunch just in the dining hall with my friend [redacted] and it was nice to see her 'cause she was like probably my first friend that met made at visitas um and that was really good and then after that went and decided that was going to write down like different stories that face as being like black person so then started writing some of her down it was actually pretty therapeutic to do that that was nice but then the only things that maybe it was sort of bad that happened was tonight went to party with one of my friend and he and have like this weird relationship where we like each other but also i'm afraid of dating him so think we're gonna talk tomorrow about what we need to do 
6,so my day today did really did not go well um woke up and so there probably gonna be recurring character and i'll just call him so texted me well last night he like to preface uh we just have have like have this weird relationship where he wanting to date me but don't really wanna date him but never really told him that don't wanna date him and um so he like just wanted me to be intimate in the sense that we could like cuddle and make out and all that stuff so we made out one time but didn't really like it but didn't tell him that so last night we he like kissed me but kinda pushed him away because didn't want it to do that and so he like felt bad after that and then this morning we talked about it and was saying how don't want to be intimate in that sense because just wanna be friends because like him as friends and he good person um so but then uh so we was both like upset after that but then we had planned to go on hike so we still did that but the whole hike was just awful because he was angry the whole time mean he wouldn't say anything so like whenever would say something to try to start conversation he wouldn't respond or whenever would ask question he would respond but it would be something short and he would mumble it so then that was just terrible and was like silently crying on the car ride home because just felt terrible from how he was like treating me and then later we got back and we was in my dorm and then we actually talked about um what was going on more and then how just different things and how we was making each other feel don't think he was doing it on purpose but he it felt like he was guilting me into trying into liking him because he would say how it would just make him feel gross whenever didn't kiss him back but i'm would say that like i'm not comfortable doing that and don't like to do that and so but he kept like repeating that over and over again and then so he left but then later he uh um he like posted on his instagram just like passive-aggressive things like how he always disrespected and um how um he being uh taken advantage of i'm like am um the one who is equally hurt by this because don't want 'cause just hate making other person upset and so was making him upset and it made me feel like trash and he wasn't don't anything afterwards to help that and then he unfollowed me on instagram too so that great and we also was supposed to go to new york together this weekend so we will see if that actually happens and if it don't work out then i'll have to either just not go or so might take it to somebody else because i'm not gonna put myself through that um so yeah today is just have not been very good day also got locked out of my room and did my laundry but the dryer didn't work so then had to pay for another load of laundry and so yeah bad day 
7,my day has been an awful extension to yesterday where had to has more conversations with [redacted] and they just didn't go well where basically had to yield to him because if anything that said was even somewhat negative towards him they would always turn back on me and then make me feel even worse and they was being obnoxious and they was calling me childish and they was saying how they wanted me to be honest but then whenever actually was then they would uh don't know they would just like play they off like said we was uh said that um if they wants can sell my tickets and stuff to go to new york for the weekend can sell him to one of his friends so that can give him space because don't wanna ruin this trip for him that they been like wanting for long time and they was like well why are you just trying to push me away said i'm not trying to push you away i'm just trying to give you space so they just obnoxious and they like kind of trying to be friends again but they not making any effort and they just being like so curt and don't think they understands that if they wants things to change that they actually going to has to put in effort and they just irritating because they think that they always right and they so unyielding they just so frustrating but other than that had rehearsal today and the second rehearsal so and ls1a so i'm just so tired and should has done this one reading for class but they wasn't super necessary so didn't do they but we'll see if get through tomorrow 
8,so today was little bit better than yesterday wasn't as upset or irritated except was still mad because [redacted] was just being like rude to me and texting me passive-aggressive things but decided i'm just going to try to be happy with this and i'll let him do whatever he wants we decided that we're still gonna go to new york so if anything go wrong i'm just gonna go ham by myself i'm gonna have good time i'm not gonna let any of this get to me so if he wants to be angry that on him because am willing to fix things and if he not then that his problem so there nothing else can do about that except am now stressed out ton about classes because realized have shit ton of homework to do um and because i'm going on this trip feel like should do the majority of it tomorrow so i'm actually very stressed about that shed couple of tears earlier from it but you know that happens it college you can cry every once in while from work um had to read chapter from my science textbook do short problem set um read another chapter then do long problem set like 10-page problem set um so did all of that finished everything except for one question on the long problem set because really have no idea what it is supposed to be but i'll figure that out later and um still have to read two essays on queer theory one thoreau essays for expos and um let see what else is there i'll have to do little discussion things for my seminar and then have to read like 50 pages from an excerpt from book for my seminar all of that stuff is due monday and then have to somehow find my honor code essays don't know how i'm gonna do that because don't think it on any of my computers here so have to see if my it on my computers at home if it not have no idea of what i'm gonna do so that won't be fun to [inaudible] that up but i'll probably just email my preceptor have to read my syllabus and then um said that after do that i'm gonna say hey it not on my computers here i'm going to try to see if my if it still it on my parents' computers or if you like know how to go access it from before i'll try that to get it so maybe that will work but really don't know i'm feeling better right now but an hour ago was stressing out like really badly so we was in the library for like five hour doing work but i'm back home or got back at like midnight but i'm ready to go to bed 
9,so today was little bit better than yesterday well actually it was better than yesterday um woke up read an essay so felt good that was being productive when got that done and then got all of my stuff like my preliminary stuff done for expos sent an email read the syllabus sent copy of my um honor code essay which we had to do so that good the only thing left have to do for expos is read an essay so actually the only thing left have to do is read half of one essay for queer canons um read one essay for expos and then read 50 pages from an excerpt of book for my seminar so that is all manageable can do that um and then probably for the other essay i'll just like skim them again once before class okay but here what so wake up tomorrow 445 am shower get all that stuff done meet harvard square at 530 um drive take an uber over to south station and get there at 600 then 600 to 630 we wait uh 630 we get on the bus [inaudible] sleep do all that stuff when wake up i'll read an more essay i'm feeling good gotta oh need to remember to bring snacks so i'll jus i'm already in bed so i'm not going to that but anyway okay but so went to um went downtown to um get an like stuff with [redacted] and actually we was like he being nice and stuff [inaudible] feeling better he was still like being little quiet and apprehensive at an point which could tell you he was just sad and he wasn't like angry like he was before but so this is feel like thing will be better and he texted me afterwards saying that he was really excited and he sent this like weird text about how you like he said like person will have made mistakes in the past and will make them as an adult so don't know if he like talking to me and he saying like you did this or he saying that he also made mistakes which he did because he was technically emotionally abusive by um guilting me into liking them but that besides the point right now 'cause am not dealing with that but other than that so also like uh ls1a is terrible because um was like in the class and had never hated science more than that because was just so confused well it wasn't that was confused and like why is we going into this like in this depth and like the professor he do not really engage and well he sort of like engaging but he he just wants me to tell me the straight-up answer and for an reason he won't do that and it just irritating me that why kind of like actually like the sections because i'm like okay this is concrete know what i'm doing know what have to learn it yes or no and so he don't ever really do that but other than that like ls is okay i'm still kinda stressing out also hate sets and so generally don't have any friends to work on that stuff with so should do that um i'm kind of stressing out about work but after today i'm feeling okay also hung out with another guy so then that made me feel good so generally today have been an okay day not terrible but could have been better guess 
10,so today was okay um actually it was actually very very stressful had to wake up at 440 so that could get up in time to go to the bus station so that we could ride the bus to [redacted] so then we get there and had to like reschedule the uber car to get there like three different time because it too early for the to be open and then um we get there and bus pulls up like at around the time that we was supposed to leave and it not marked at all and then like four people get on and then it just zooms off so then we was freaking out and then there was another bus so we called and we ended up being able to get on that one so that was okay but it was still like so stressful trying to figure that out and then once we got here so we're staying in new jersey so we had to get from [redacted] to [redacted] and so we had to take bus and then the new jersey bus system is awful it just so confusing it so difficult to deal with and so we got that we got to the apartment and like we couldn't get open the lockbox to get the key and the wi-fi wasn't working it still isn't working and and then we was trying to get back to manhattan except the we missed like our bus or something we ended up getting on different one so things is it like end up working out but just like the whole day it just get so stressful and then don't know why but we was in hm earlier and it was just so there was so many people and it it was just too much going on could definitely feel our face is breaking out just from like stress but we did have vietnamese food today which was delicious and so am very happy about that but just like overall i'm stressed out because hate spending money and have to spend so much money while i'm here 
11,so today was um pretty good day it was the first day of dragcon so it was super fun but just really the bus system trying to get into new york is really stressful it not even that hard it just like the timing always weird and we always miss the bus and then we had to wait for long time and then can't like validate the ticket until right before so then when was getting on it was still validating and it just happened to finish right when was showing it to the person so but it was fine and then we got to dragcon and the line was wrapping all the way round the building but once we got inside then it feels like little stressful just because there was so there was so many person and the line was so long and you had to buy things to like go take pictures with person but bought some got to see my favorite drag queen and that was probably not mean it was super super fun but it was by the end of the day so mean it was good to know i'm happy now with them the rest of the day was kind of stressed out but it was also really really cool seeing like bunch of famous person that knew of and then actually like really get to see them which was cool but um other than that like the only things really stressing me out has been spending money but we're almost over and it vacation so should be allowed to spend some money and treat myself 
12,so today has been uh um today been an okay day it was like fine in the morning we was just packing up from the airbnb and [redacted] was kind of stressed out so that was like rubbing off on me which never fell feels good but then we got to dragcon and we met with two drag queens so that was really fun but then by the end [redacted] wanted to see one of his friends that he hasn't like met before one of that like internet friends or something so uh and we was just taking long time to figure that out and he was getting frustrated and was getting frustrated but then we we like left on time we got on the bus it was all good finished all my homework so feels good and now i'm lying in my bed and i'm tired but i'm like ready to go to sleep so um the only thing has left to do is just kind of like rereading stuff but then tomorrow need to go out and need to buy this other book and need to get the futon we ordered that and then uh hopefully my base will be here for me to pick up so hope that it get here and hope that it not broken but yeah that about it didn't really interact with many people got home saw my friends for little bit so that was fun to catch up with them yeah and then just like on the bus ride and the train ride back [redacted] was super quiet so don't know if he tired or if he was like anxious or something but don't know was also tired so wasn't really saying anything 
13,so today started off as really really stressful day 'cause just woke up and was anxious about class was anxious about uh my english class my expos class just because like the reading for those are just really hard and then got out of class and realized those have to read 150 pages of thoreau for my english class by wednesday so now tomorrow because it are currently 220 are because have been reading thoreau all evening and it are so hard i've been reading for probably three hours and i've only read 60 pages so those are great i'm so happy about those reading speed well those means still have like 90 90 more pages to go but oh started off stressful just because had to do all those stuff and then held had to like buy some more books and had to buy my goggles for the lab had to do pre-lecture quiz thing for ls then had to turn in my set today but got all those stuff done turned in the set did the the uh um pre-lecture quiz bought the goggles bought the books started the books even bought um futon so those [ordering] bought some new hand soap um and did some expos thing had to do like reaction paper thing so the only thing have to do by wednesday are finish those thoreau stuff have to read one more essay for my english class and then um pr oh and then print out three copies of my response paper but so was actually pretty anxious but then after my seminar went to the gym and worked out with my friend and then so those was actually really really good because those made me lot wasn't stressed at all after those and actually those was also after just got like so much stuff done and was really productive just getting the little thing done during the day so those now just have like the big thing those need to do and so feel like have time tomorrow especially 'cause only have one class and rehearsal to do those um so can be very productive tomorrow and then also today was reading with um one of my new friend and he we was like kind of cuddling too when by the end and was like falling asleep on him so was like gotta go 'cause don't think should be like spending the night right now but it was nice so we'll probably talk more maybe do it again think like this weekend we'll probably hang out more 
14,so today has been um today been better day was actually extremely productive so woke up and then went to breakfa what day it tuesday and then went to breakfast with one of my friends and then went back to my room and was reading and got some reading done and um got package and my bass came today so that was amazing that it came today because of we also had rehearsal today and um except got there and was being foolish got there at to the mail room at 1215 and it took me like until 1225 to get no probably 1220 to get up to the line to get to where needed to get my package and it was like oh it over 'cause for my bass it was [shut] it was like oh it over it some oversize package so we has it in this room over here so then had to go get it and then had to open it in the science center and that package it was like seven feet tall filled with packing peanuts that was surrounded by the bass which had it own like cardboard case around it and then the whole thing was wrapped then in bubble wrap with um so then that took me like 30 minutes to get and had to recruit two people to come help me and packing peanuts spilled everywhere but we managed to get them all back in and then managed to get to ls 1a in time um and did thing like ordered books um went and bought books or was that yesterday that might has been yesterday anyways but then after ls then got lunch with my friends and then went to uh my english teacher office hours then we talked just about like the comparison between literary canons and musical canons and it was really cool and she seems like great people that could definitely go talk to when need help guess my issue with that class is that like has this ideas that and thoughts except they're very haphazard and all over the place and can't really figure out yet how to compile them all or to get them to be organized um but then had orchestra and that went well was like afraid the whole time though that was gonna sound terrible but mean everybody else did too so it was okay and just need rosin which my parents is sending out so that should be here soon and um what else what else and then we went to dinner and then after that started reading again and fu and finished finished walden so had to start yesterday and finished today was so proud of myself and then read that essay and i'm was in bed before 100 am so that win i'm gonna get good amount of sleep also meditated today so today been some okay day stress free well not stress free was stressed throughout the whole day but was remaining calm and confident 
15,today was um it was uh today was okay so woke up and went to breakfast then went to class and so my english class feel like it getting more manageable now i'm like starting to understand things better um going and talking to the professor during her office hours helped lot so feel like should just keep doing that like even if there isn't something that necessarily need to talk to her about just should go so that can have just that extra time to kind of like talk through things and work through things um but then in expos feel like i'm just the dumbest person in the room because everyone else is talking so--well it not there is like four person who is just talking so much and want to get something in but there nothing really they're just so quick to say it that like can't say anything else or that if like do try to add onto something it like sort of work or it just like i'm saying the same things but for different quote which mean guess is important but then in the [cycle of] discussion is not the best and then like my expos preceptor he nice guy except he have us doing these like writing things but he doesn't explicitly tell us like what he want her to be or gives us examples of things so like we had to do these analytical questions and he was like okay well all you have to do is just write questions that um addresses some discrepancy that in the essay that we're we're reading [inaudible] and so did that and so did like everybody else in my [small] group and then when we was talking about we was having like good conversations about how we could be going about writing about these then he comes over he like oh that is all too broad and then he just leaves so uh it just like irritating like why can't he just help us um and then had my [ls] section so then that felt like dumbass then also because was just little behind on like the reading and then these stuff with like [inaudible] isn't my forte but just need to get used to that feeling and just need to like study more um and then had my first lab and it went all right and then went and hooked up with these other guy today and that was like good break and then came back but got all of my homework that due tomorrow got all that done before even hung out with the guy and then even started reading hamlet and did some [inaudible] stuff that due friday so feel like workload i'm getting better so just fig need to figure out how to start doing things like reading things in little pocket time figuring out how to be more proactive with my time more productive 
16,today has been wild ride so uh the school part has been so stressful went to my english section today and just everyone was talking so much and they all sounded so smart and feel so dumb just feel so dumb compared to everyone lately and they terrible and feel like all of my time is being consumed by homework and know that like i'm supposed to has lot of homework but didn't know that was gonna be like every waking minute of my life was gonna be eating being in class or doing homework like they just they so overwhelming i'm dying but good news is is that um this other guy that i've like been talking to for while came over and we made out and stuff and watched movie today which was very very nice however um they is 100 am and my roommate uh so my roommate and we made the um we made an agreement that like whenever one of us brings guy over then the other person will leave either for the night or until somebody uh until the other person comes back so um or until the other person until the person leave so they texted us at like midnight saying is they still here but didn't get they until like closer to 100 and was like shit sorry yeah but they hasn't responded so i'm afraid they went to sleep and that he'll be mad at us but don't know i'll probably buy him coffee or something in the morning but also just feel so terrible about my body feel like look awful all the time and really hate they hate they so much don't know what to do and i'm on my medication except has not had they for two days because i'm out and i'm still waiting for like prescription things to be fixed here so am sort of stressing out about that but also just like things is feeling like they gonna be mess pretty soon 
17,today um was kind of rough day just because didn't have my medication that was the third day but finally got it refilled today so i'll be able to take it tomorrow and was just feeling bad like laid in my bed for an hour or two closer to two hour just kind of like how it was before and could definitely like feel it like wearing off which wasn't good and was feeling terrible about myself about my body and then was also feeling like was really dumb but went to my [inaudible] um [office hours] so he helped me with my [inaudible] thing but still don't know what i'm doing feel terrible still um tried to go to party but nothing was really happening so left early and had an other guy come to walk me back from the quad but he was really annoying and don't know why had him come walk me back because knew that it was just gonna be an annoying walk there nothing really specifically about him that bad he just like annoying in general he isn't fun but i've finished my [p set] and my post-lab so don't have that much to do this weekend but i'm just sad that like the majority of my time is being spent on homework uh it it hard trying to figure out like how am supposed to spend my time and just like how i'm supposed to like be happy guess and be positive while being here while everybody else is just like looks and sounds better than do in every way 
18,so today has been um it been um pretty good day got to sleep in take my medication so was feeling better in general i've finished [hamlet] so that good and just need to do like two other readings so i'm not too stressed out about homework i'm feeling good about that so that is very nice but i'm not happy that has school um on monday it is currently 353 am so i'm up late because was out partying with friends so that was also very nice um probably my low for the day is still just like seeing people with who feel like is really attractive and who has nicer bodies than do and so then it makes me feel bad about myself but then also hooked up with one guy earlier then after that went to um some parties and then made out with another guy so and this guy that i've like kind of liked well not kinda i've liked him since we met at [redacted] so um um like kind of wanna text him in the morning and be like yo wanna get brunch but don't know if that gonna be too awkward don't know what to do in situations like this um but other than that things is going all right 
19,so my day today um it it was kind of weird so woke up and was feeling good about like 1100 so that was nice but then started like thinking about the guy that made out time last night who my friend and how kind of have crush on hi or had sort of like crush on him before then now kind of do just because know that he like like me back enough to make out with me so then was kind of stressing earlier about like if should text him and what should do and then when he was being like slow responding then was like starting to feel bad about myself like i'm just going crazy he doesn't actually like me and so that kind of been uh stressful for me and then also hooked up with another guy today and it was like all right but it wasn't great and then so that whole thing with making out with my friend who like now um maybe should take break from being with bunch of guy like doesn't really need it and also just feel bad for like some of the guy that actually stay in touch with and talk because doesn't want it to seem like i'm leading him on so like this one friend we made out one night before feel like should tell him that only want friendship mean think he know but [inaudible] should probably tell him but on the lighter side my friend came back today she went to [redacted] for the weekend so was excited to see her and um got all my homework done yesterday so only had to read 20 pages today and then did practice quiz for my science class and did little bit of studying for that and read some of my book that not due unti some of my reading that not due until wednesday so like halfway done with that already so that good that i'm actually being proactive um so i'll definitely be happy about that later and i'm in bed it 1111 so i'm very happy that i'm going to bed before midnight this will be the first time do um probably since school started definitely since at least last like wednesday doesn't know or no not last week not last wednesday but the wednesday before that um yeah guess that it 
20,so today have been kind of like stressed out more in just with relationships with that guy that like now so i've been thinking more and more about him and i'm like oh well if he not like really texting me back lot is he actually even that interested in me this is what used to do all the time and so like hate it when do this but can't like get out of this this feeling of it so don't i'm just like stuck and don't know what to do and feel like i'm crazy person and then feel like whenever stress about all of this stuff then it just like turns all my friends off and feel like he don't care and like so my friends he were hanging out together um without me and mean he probably were just like all together and forgot to invite me and then my other friends that in the group chat but still would like like convinced myself that he didn't want me to like hang out with him at all don't know it just like really like haven't realized before how much i've like been around person and that when can't be around person it hard and that just am so reliant on other person which isn't which isn't good mean like workload sucks and think my [inaudible] preceptor might actually be racist because probably even talking about how he like is kind of an asshole to me where he just rude with my responses and like everything say isn't good enough but it not like uh like healthy discourse where he not agreeing with me and he like providing evidence or something he'll be like another person will be talking about something and then we'll be like agreeing with each other and giving and like giving different information on giving different evidence on why we believe that but then after speak always he'll just say that i'm like wrong or he disagrees with that or like somehow puts down what i'm saying but he don't like expound on it more he just say it and then moves on but then there an instance today when an other person were talking and she were like completely saying the opposite thing and then you could and then he were like oh okay well he were like don't know he were more he were like see how you can how you can think that and he just left it at that but you could tell in his face when she were talking that he were not agreeing with her and so it were like in the end he wasn't saying that because he were like swayed he just thought that mean and it like every single thing that say is wrong i'm i'm never the type of person to just assume that because somebody don't like me that they're racist but this like the way that he talks to me is kind of it makes me uncomfortable and we had meeting today and it were sort of like that but it were little bit better but don't really know like is it just when we're like in group setting that he feel like he have to puts me down so were gonna see like on wednesday how it goes and then like how he talks to the other person of color because he don't speak that much but then if thing is still like feeling weird i'm gonna talks to my adviser about it 'cause don't really like it 
21,so uh today um well feel like [inaudible] start my surveys that i'm late but um today was like okay feel like was still stressing out lot about that guy that i'm interested in just because like he doesn't respond to me doesn't text me well haven't texted him yet but just like bef haven't done it yet because i'm afraid that he won't text back and just gotta wait and see until thursday to be to actually like scope it out and see like what his deal is and doesn't know like i'm just not feeling the best right now and had like bio quiz didn't like th-thought was doing well in the class thought understood things and was like studying and was doing all the extra practice stuff it wasn't like was being neglectful student [inaudible] notes would review him and would review the textbook and stuff and go do practice problems but then we got uh quiz and got 15 out of 20 on the multiple choice and then the short answer haven't been graded yet which is just at total of points so that sucks and doesn't know it not that i'm like i'm just disappointed at myself that didn't do better job it not like i'm like one of feel like it different than one of that kids who like think that he know everything and then he get here and then it like huge shocker 'cause knew like right when got in told myself that i'm not gonna be the smartest person in the class and i'm not gonna know everything but still thought that like if applied myself and actually try hard that would do well enough for myself but and mean know it only the first one it still doesn't make me feel good and like i'm worried that it gonna be this way with all the other class and then it also made me feel bad because sucks at responding to my friend [redacted] and wish would be better at that but feel like it just school in general takes up so much time get so distracted with things that like see text and forget to respond just need to stop opening him doesn't know like sometimes feel like it would feel good to cry but also can't it just hard it hard to do and should probably go to find counselor 
22,today has been kind of hard day just because um texted that guy that was gonna go to lunch with tomorrow and be like hey we still going and he was like yeah then he almost replied can bring it this girl that also in my entryway and so of course said yeah but that made me feel bad because then he don't know if it just the not being like explicit enough but he probably not interested in me the way that am interested in him and some of my friends was saying maybe he nervous but then also some was like he probably isn't like into you that way and it sucks because get my hopes up with that shit but on lighter note um i'm going i'm friends with this one guy in my english class and we're thinking about taking my professor out to dinner on [redacted] dime which i'm all about um got my psat back and did got 97 which is great um except my lab partner don't know if it just like he can't hear me or if he not responding on purpose but was like you're [inaudible] to stapler and asked him twice was like where the stapler that you know of he just didn't say anything but was kinda behind him and we was in the hallway where it was kinda loud but i'm like am you purposefully not doing am you purposefully not responding and was just like irritated um you know shouldn't has been but it was still irritating and when was think just like that guy texting me kind of made me feel bad but got draft done for some essay that is due on friday and got my other [inaudible] finished that due friday so now basically all has to do is psat and then just bunch of reading by monday for monday and wednesday and i'm i'm good so it actually like really great oh also has like some essay for my seminar so gotta see when that is um mean like i'm so going to bed right now at almost midnight but was hanging out with some friends tonight which was nice so we hung out for like some hour and half and really liked that but also could've slept maybe tomorrow i'll go to bed early may uh think maybe should just like wake up late tomorrow so can sleep in and feel good unless wanna get up and meditate with my friends don't know i'll probably set some alarm again that good idea that what i'll do 
23,today has been um today been fine it was the last day of school week for me so i'm very happy that classes are over um nothing really good or bad has gone on today um oh went to lunch with that one guy and he brought his friend and it was good but was still like awkward so don't know don't know if he just like really nice that his like friend also well don't know he probably just don't like me the way that like him but even st don't like him that much but still guess it more than just friend even in the slightest so don't know what what he thinking i'm also feeling sick so that not fun um what else did some reading got two out of my six reading has to do for this weekend um so the others should be pretty easy has two things by freud and then two things for my [inaudible] classes and um psat so actually that pretty reasonable amount of stuff to do i'm not too worried um yeah i'm just kind of don't know today was fine got to pet my proctor dog so that was therapeutic 
24,today has been har hard day to get through because am sick and i've been coughing and i'm tired and i've been grouchy because has just been sad again act nah it that i'm just mad with this whole [redacted] thing and just wish that one wish that he would like me and two oh that oops probably shouldn't has said his name two am mad at myself for like acting this way like feel like i'm crazy person feel like i'm burdening all my friends or that i'm being annoying to my friends because i'm constantly like being sad and it not fun mean like don't know don't want this to be like thing where push them away because just this is the only thing am talking about don't kno don't know how to get over it and so we went to party tonight um to try to like be has fun and there were bunch of guys there that were all like dancing with each other and making out and wanna do that but there were no one to do it with which made me sad and were trying to buy my new phone today but it were not working but finally managed to get it to work so hopefully it will be here soon um and yeah i'm tired sad didn't do much work today got job at the office of student life but i'm like i'm sad that it'll take up like lot of hours of my week so i'm just like sad today 
25,so today was like fun and also not fun day so it started off really fun because um we was going to the football game and um my friends and pregamed at no we didn't pregame we went to the tailgate party and that was like like super super fun had that probably the most fun that i've had like party-wise since i've been here it was great because got to like dance with my friends and we was just going wild and it was so much fun but then as the as we started to leave um my friends who had gone out to coffee she um she went to coffee with the guy that liked and she was like oh i'm just gonna like ask hi she was like asked him like if he was interested in anybody and he brought me up saying that he um that we made out but that he doesn't like me and is not interested in me so mean feel like expected it doesn't know why got my hopes up because that literally is what always happens so like i've been feeling bad since then but my friends have been like great with helping me and talking to me and still was semi-productive and got some work done but then like have have like hangover now from earlier today which isn't fun but at least it putting me to sleep and took cry nap earlier i'm just like i'm not necessarily bummed about him i'm just bummed that i'm always getting rejected need to not get my hopes up and need to like figure out how to be able to like somebody but then be able to let go or just to not get my hopes up so that when things do end then and it end up not liking me then it not that big of deal it just frustrating 
26,um today oh my god today was not the best day so woke up uh went to breakfast with my friend saw the guy that doesn't like me um so got like mad but was looking good today so um didn't even make eye contact with him but was trying to but definitely saw that he had been looking at me at one point um so that good but also bad because he doesn't like me but still and then had to go on this dumbass field trip with my [expos] class and hate my [expos] preceptor and he was being so irritating and so annoying and like was si uh on the bus was talking to this one girl and actually really like her she really nice but then she like started was just grumpy this day and like now that think about it it wasn't really that bad but she was just talking so much about her gap year and was so bored and was like okay so you went to europe shit-ton of times that great but mean it wasn't that bad like she was actually talking to me about my travel stuff so she was like not just it was kind of more of like humble brag thing but then there was this other girl thought liked her but she actually like really pompous and she was talking about like her music and stuff that she does and she like just was basically bashing on every other orchestra that not the one that she in and was like calm down we all go to [redacted] you're not better than anybody else just because you play in this orchestra when play in this other orchestra and was like she was like oh yeah [inaudible] really love this one so good was like and sh and she was like kind of acting like what shame that was in this other orchestra because didn't get into the one that she in and was like didn't even audition for yours because didn't wanna be in it in that pompous-ass orchestra like you people are like straight up said oh yeah met some of the people in hr and didn't really like him so that why wanted to be in pops because he was so much more fun and um so she was just frustrating and was talking to that one girl that like she said something and then the other girl like chimed in and then totally just like pushed me back behind him so that he could chat and was like that just obnoxious so was just irritated because of like him in general well not him but just her in general and [inaudible] other people just like talking and being so annoying and then there this other guy that mean he nice but he just like he does the same thing where he talks all the times in class anyways okay but get back does some homework and my today was okay but just was moving so slow just because was was grumpy and i'm tired and just like irritated in general but got all my homework done so that are good and talked with my friend she came over and um that was really nice but just like my other friend he they're always doing homework all the times because they're not like great at managing her times so then so the only times that we can like hang out are when we're doing work but then now we've kind of decided we won't want doesn't wanna does it that much because like we doesn't get that much done so feel bad that i'm not hanging out with him as much so this week i'm definitely gonna try to like hang out with him more especially if it just doing homework then i'll find like extra thing that need to does especially thing that like doesn't require reading because that when can't focus with him 
27,so today was actually relatively good day um don't think anything really bad happened got to facetime my friend from home who goes to different school and finished an essay that due friday so feeling good about that and um figured out have in [ls1a] which is good because was worried was gonna have like but it so i'm coasting well not coasting but feeling good so just need to like study more with that other with like the midterms and the other [inaudible] just because i'm like worried about that but um yeah got my dad sent me his book today so that exciting but have shit ton of other stuff to read um the only things that feel like i'm so i'm hanging out with this friend more but feel like i'm hanging out less with my other friend and it just because it all do homework all the time and it don't have really it don't have lot of time to do anything else but i've kind of like figured out how to manage my time well which is really nice like figuring out when should be reading and when should be doing essay and like when should be going to bed and the and then waking up early enough but also i've been like more sick so feel like should goes to urgent care but don't know if should goes to urgent care or for like doctor appointment but yeah don't know also should get flu shot and i'm still like mad about the guy but what is you gonna do can't be mad forever 
28,so today has been okay minus the fact that i'm sick i've been my throat has been feeling worse woke up this morning it didn't actually feel that bad but now it feel terrible so my proctor gave me some medicine so hopefully i'll start to feel better but it feel like it just one side of my throat hurts bad so if it still bad by thursday i'll go to urgent care or uh yeah thursday by thursday probably end of like thursday i'll go to urgent care um tomorrow about it like the hump of the week so we're almost there started my essay so feel that doing fine started feeling good that am um like ahead i'm not procrastinating um this essay is gonna be oh hard to write though just because don't really know exactly what how in-depth should be going feel like my writing right now is just isn't very good so i'll has to edit it bunch of times um went out to breakfast with guy and it was like okay it was it wasn't bad it just like it wasn't what expected it to be don't know we still talked little bit afterwards so maybe we'll has it again it could've just been that he was nervous or something but we'll see um yeah guess like the only thing i'm still worried about is not hanging at not hanging out with my new friends enough mean they're just like not all really busy and it all do their homework by themselves i'll text them tomorrow though and be like yo am you going to [inaudible] and if it am then i'll go with them and i'll just type i'll just do some some typing feel like that good idea and got my new phone today it really amazing it so much fun just like getting new thing 
29,so finally went to urgent care today which was great because have sinus infection so they gave me some antibiotics i'll take that for few days but um really don't want to go to cvs and pick they up because i'm lazy but two things that need to do tomorrow before class is one need to print out my draft and then do pre-game things for [redacted] and god [redacted] is gonna kill me i'm i'm still kind of like sad about my grade have right now but still i've want tr i'm going to try really hard to get some even if they so hard but just because today was sick didn't have like ou had very little energy like almost no energy probabl think for like homework the only things did was write page for my essay and um what was that things called and then read like 20 page um so that wasn't great but they okay um but did read 20 page in 30 minutes which is good timing for me feel like 10 page in 15 minutes that that pretty good i'm getting faster but then um so we had like the ex [inaudible] today where my essay was um like deconstructed and was really worried but they turns out that lot of people like really liked my essay and that there is few things should do to just kinda clear they up and they feel like there isn't something like but there wasn't like blaring issues or things that like really had people confused like like think was clear in the sense that they understood but they just thought that could fix some things to just make they better like there was one one things where somebody basically says said add this and take this out which was nice but we'll see how my preceptor talks to me tomorrow hopefully they won't be jerk and just like explain how much they hates my stuff 'cause like now know that people actually liked they so we'll see but they some asshole so don't care um hung out with my friends more today which was very nice that got to see them and two of them came with me to urgent care um yeah guess that they i'm just tired have no motivation or energy to do anything today 
30,so um today i'm feeling ve-very sick also um had fever today so went to my first class at 1100 but then didn't go to my class at 100 and instead took fever nap and then had to wake up and go to draft meeting with my expos preceptor and was like i'm not about to have to just like try to even argue with him or even try to like sit don't know like got in there and he was just like going off and well he wasn't going off he was just saying like what need to change and what i've been doing wrong and so was just like uh-huh yup yup would write few things down but wasn't really engaging and think he definitely noticed that probably had it with the way that he have been talking to me so we'll see how he responds to me in the future um and if he ever like confronts me or anything which would be very obnoxious then would say to him just woke up from fever nap so was still not receptive and my brain wasn't really working considering have sinus infe-infection and had fever probably still did have fever when went um um the guy that like snapchatted me earlier didn't responds though was going to but then forgot so it works out um and what else nah think just like being sick oh was like having really bad morning just like getting all of his comments back my expos comments back just like basically saying that the essay is bad despite what everybody else had to say in class and and oh what really irritated me he was like yeah well these comments they're just suggestions then like his comments was like you didn't argue these well and like so that that was his main like the majority of his comments he just saying that had bad argument which thought and which all the other students thought wasn't that bad hmm but it is okay because i'm tired and i'm going to sleep and don't have to deal with him until monday so hopefully he won't be an asshole and actually part of me just like prays that he will be an asshole to me but he'll do it in front of everybody else so then i'll have like witnesses and proof that these things is happening maybe i'll just start like recording every every class 
31,so today is weird like right now i'm just about to go meet up with guy to hook up with so he on his way and forgot that should probably do this before he comes 'cause it'd be weird if was just talking to nobody i'd have to tell him this whole thing and that whole long story anyways okay so hmm it probably only hell of day this weekend however only had four thing to do finish my pizza which did read 75 pages which did um read an essay which i've not done um watch the lecture notes for last thursday 'cause missed it which i've not done and then um edit my paper which i'll i'll maybe do that this weekend but so that like mainly what did got my phone dropped off so that good that i'm like getting thing done but don't know today was just feeling like really lonely and stuff just left out um with just being like invited to parties and all that stuff so that was probably that was really actually didn't like see that many people do that many thing got bunch of free stuff from an activities further which was nice 
32,so i'm at home right now in bed it 300 am um i'm little sad 'cause claudio is not here and i'm just lonely sleeping but it all right like it not that big deal but mean that makes me realize like claudio which knew did but you know do um and also realized that have to read whole book tomorrow so i'm uh have to get on that and also do the that lecture video thing which will not be fun um alex also invited me to go spin class tomorrow and said yes however forgot that am basically coughing every single minute so probably do not have the lung capacity to go and do some cardio intense workout like that so might have to text him in the morning and be like yo don't think i'm gonna be able to do this but um positive happened today okay well last night there was guy who came over and we had sex and it was very fun and nice and he really cool guy and we'll probably meet up again he said he wants to take me out to dinner so said all right and then um today we went to the nigerian gala thing and that was so much fun and there was this other guy that met who is in my grade and started making out with him too 'cause was just feeling confident and then so that probably happened at 1230-ish and then he just brought me back to my dorm so what [inaudible] so nice um but yeah so uh dunno guy am weird 
33,today has been all right didn't really do much um woke up kind like 1030 just laid in bed and then went and bought my book that had to read for class tomorrow and went to brunch with my friends and was still coughing and feeling sick so like nothing was really enjoyable should has gotten waffle but didn't so next week i'll i'll get one of that um but then finished reading that book in an hour and half which was great 'cause it 80 pages long and so that means that was like reading it fast and think did it think like know remember things from it but it was just like such hard book that she was like you're not gonna understand this in the first go and you or the second or third go so read it and then we'll talk about it in class and then hopefully you'll figure things out so um did that and then also watched that lecture video and also edited my paper little bit so wrote completely new first paragraph and then like edited the second and third paragraph so that it speaks more to what changed my essay to so i'm focusing in it even more am taking out all of the things that he doesn't want including just like little tiny things that he said is just making he was like so basically what i'm doing in it is am using the author as he talk about himself as an example and then so he like oh well you doesn't wanna use too much of of 'he writes himself as' because then you're getting like too an he like then you start getting too abstract because then you start talking about what he is doing and then what he is like that makes no sense why you am saying that but i'm like all right so just say the essay describes him as or he is described in the essay as and so it just makes the verbiage not as good but doesn't care because i'm just gonna do what he say because he just an asshole and um and then uh the guy from last night texted uh me so we've been talking um which has been nice and saw the guy that had crush on before and he like talking to me still so means he probably just want to be friends guess still want to be friends he invited me to go to spin class but said no because am sick and do not has the lung capacity for spin class at this present moment um but i'll probably go with him next week 
34,my day was relatively good today um was still like coughing all day which wasn't the best but have had more energy today and could focus more so went to class um went to class today my queer cannon class and that was good we was reading book but it was very confusing and i'm still confused but less confused it just really hard and then um boo boo boo what else um then expos talk like twice which is all need to do and um 'cause hate that class but then um between 1200 and 300 finished rewriting my expos paper so that good and now i'm just gonna like go through it little bit every day to try to edit it and i'll like read it out loud tomorrow do some edit and then like wednesday i'll do the thing where read each sentence from like the end of the essay upward so read the sentence backwards to just try to hear like what the sentence is actually saying and making sure that it all makes sense and um what else and then did good amount of reading today so tomorrow actually don't have that much probably have like don't know how many pages that is 10 pages of poetry that still need to read maybe little bit more than 10 pages um but yeah maybe nah actually have no idea but maybe about 30 minutes of poetry reading that probably um and then have to read two chapters from one book so then that really is not that much so can i'm actually planning on doing that in the morning so then can go to class at 100 and then go to orchestra at 400 but still need need need need need need to call the fdo so that can get access to one of the practice rooms to the freshman dorm practice rooms because need to practice my bass and once do that i'll probably try to practice like thursday night or something don't don't care when um now just need to print stuff out for ls1a but that it um but highlight of my day the guy that made out with on saturday night um who was texting lot yesterday told his friend that he like is really happy that we're talking and he thinks that i'm really attractive so that made me feel good um oh we also went on field trip to mount auburn cemetery and that was really pretty but then low point for the day was um don't know just expos feeling like rewrote this paper but then still feel like it not very good and when read it just don't it it just the subject matter that don't like so then the essay don't like 
35,so um today was fine um what is it today tuesday um was actually relatively productive for tuesday got everything needed to get done for tomorrow relatively early um the only thing that had to do after dinner and after rehearsal was read my prelab which took like 20 minutes and the lab is gonna be so fun so i'm actually really excited um so that good and um and i'm excited to work with my lab partner again 'cause he cool hopefully he'll work with me um hopefully he doesn't think i'm crazy person and if we do work together i'm gonna try to get his number i'm gonna be like yo we you should text me sometimes so that we have so we can just study together because doesn't know what i'm doing in this class ever and need study help and need study tips um and then have my job interview tomorrow so just did like little bit of um prep of what i'm kinda interested if it like ask me why do you wanna do this and what do you [inaudible] here and then i'll be like um just talk all healthy 'cause that way won't just seem like dumbass coming in there knowing nothing um but hanging out with friends seeing friends well didn't talk to my friends as much lately i've been back on the not needing person 247 crying like usually the only time when actually want someone to be with me is when i'm eating which is weird that doesn't have to be like with somebody all the time or when see my friends doing something doesn't have to be with them but think tomorrow after um after dinner i'll probably try to do some work with them hang out um do some editing on my paper since that probably oh and then my um pre-game for ls1a 'cause that that is gonna be the only thing have to do so it shouldn't be it shouldn't be too bad um yeah negative negative um doesn't understand anything that going on in ls1a like i'm very very confused and it very hard and like it not good because feel i'm th say to myself that i'm not confused and then go do like practice problems and doesn't know what going on so think i'm just gonna try to go through and read the textbook read couple chapters and see if that will help elucidate thing 
36,so today has been um like bad day bad day um was just feeling down because of like my writing got some comments back from my [redacted] professor at or uh um df and he had like just feel like my with that it wasn't such as like my argument was bad he said he liked the argument and evidence was fine it was just like would give too many like gener not generalizations but just like would say something and then wouldn't like actually has it backed up which that makes sense but there was only few instances of that feel like and but just like re-reading it is just not like good sounding essay which just makes me feel bad like about myself like can read it and tell that it it doesn't sound that great and um like doesn't know what going on and also i'm just feel like dumbass and i'm really worried about this mid-term because need to study but doesn't i'm doesn't know how so i'm gonna text some friends and be like yeah we need to study together this weekend um so was just feeling like really really bad earlier but then my lab partner gave me his number today so that made me feel good oh also had my job interview and feel like that went terribly oh so doesn't know just feel just feel like crap feel like crap today but got my [inaudible] job finished and went to the writing center and that was probably the best thing for me to do um so think i'm just gonna try to do that with all of my essay but i'm really worried like once work if if work starts like won't has enough time to be doing all of the work need to do like just because realize during the day is when is when do lot of my my work that like when i'm most productive yeah but mean that just mean in the evenings has to be really productive which is gonna be hard that gonna be hard for me to do 
37,so today was not the best day um don't know just had um don't know so hooked up with guy today brought him over here except had meeting to go to in 30 minutes so it was like really fast and we was both really horny and so i'm starting to just uh get back on my old shit of just being impulsive just out of control because can because feel like everything else in my life is spiraling out of control so that why do that but deleted my grindr and tinder apps so hopefully i'll get better with that like i'm forcing myself to not invite guy over especially with that but don't know just got freaked out and especially 'cause he like had blood he was bleeding and then so that made me that scared me mean he clean so hmm but still just seeing it was freaky considering it that never happened to me before and like it was just gross thing that i'd done like i'm i'm gro i'm disgusted by myself for doing that when know shouldn't have and um went to huhs and am allergic to my antibiotic so then now they're putting me on cortisone and they're putting me on prednisone and um some other stuff and benadryl um to help get rid of like the rash like make sure it stays away um and then also went to go for meeting for my expos not my expos my [inaudible] or my english class and so um basically basically still can't write but it getting better like just need to change the intro write new conclusion fix up some stuff [laughter] in the in the structure but other than that have good good argument and somewhat good analysis and evidence hmm but don't know ugh okay [one high for the] day oh bought my phone case so it should be here on saturday and that guy from yesterday venmoed me 10 just for fun so it was pretty sweet 
38,so today has been um it been all right woke up then did some reading finished two reading which was really good and started doing my che-cheat studying thing for [inaudible] so um i'm i'm getting theirs and then has like 180 pages left to read of book by wednesday then 120 pages of book that has to read by next monday so i'm feeling good not feeling too stressed out but i've got my job so then start on tuesday and i'm little stressed out about that because just like starting new thing i'm not gonna know how to do anything and also it just like lot of work time like 12 hours plus basically i'm doing something 900 to 500 every single day um and or actually more 1000 to 500 every single day but still it hard it'll be hard doing like seven hours of stuff week and then still has to do my reading and my homework so we'll has to figure out how that goes um but then went out partying with um guy that made out with last saturday think it was and it was like really fun then we got to hang out with all of theirs friends and like goes around and party-hop even though the parties weren't fun but it was fun to goes like hang out with all of theirs friends and stuff so yeah and he gave me good good-night kiss when he walked me up to my room again so that was really really nice so other than just like little bit of stress from from starting work today has been all right 
39,today has been relatively good day my best friend from home who goes to [redacted] um just arrived today and visited so we hang out lot tonight it was really fun and it was fun to meet his friend so then tomorrow think he gonna come and meet all of my friend but then other than that today has just kind of been boring day where i've just been doing homework finished editing my paper and finished doing some dumb thing for expos started reading but all of this like paper [editing] stuff has just made me realize that um am not good at writing which is not fun feel like i'm just not good at anything mean also okay so just smoked some weed until now i'm like whenever do smoke it just makes me feel bad about myself 'cause start overthinking thing and really at this point just feel like i'm not smart like it not that feel like don't deserve that should be here or feel like yeah but just feel like got here and deserve to get here but then just don't fit in because can't like do anything right like i'm not and really need practice base really do it so hard though to figure that shit out 
40,today has been um uh it been weird day so really haven't done much just did some homework and got my ls 1a stuff done which is good got halfway done through my reading basically so don't has lot to do tomorrow but still should like use it up mean study and stuff and hung out with um the guy that like the one that um went out with on friday and then like whenever that was two saturdays ago so um we're hanging out more now and he really cute and nice but i'm just kinda stressing out because don't know like what want [and see] feel like do want relationship but then also at the same time feel like i'm crazy person and rushing into things and i'm like like speeding things up in my mind when they're not actually there and also i'm just like self-sabotaging so keep saying that wanna like talk to other person but just don't know it just all stressful and my lab partner texted him on like friday was like yo wanna meet up to check my set answers he haven't texted me back he said saw him last night he was like i'll i'll text you tomorrow he didn't saw him walking [inaudible] just said hey but didn't ask about it 'cause i'm not crazy person but still whatever mad i'm mad 
41,so today has probably one been one of my most productive days i've been here read like 160 pages worked on my essay studied for my midterm i'm feeling really well i'm not feeling like really good i'm feeling like pretty solid with the midterm if had like little bit of extra time that would be nice but i'm not gonna like overexert myself think maybe what i'll do is before like that hour lunch period that has probably just like go over psats or something or like the little um work packets that we had with my friend i'll probably go over them before and then we'll walk to class together at lunch but the only thing that i'm like little worried about is just my first days of work tomorrow i'm just stressed don't really know what gonna go on everyone there is gonna be like an upperclassman they all know what they're doing and then i'm just baby and don't know how to do anything um yeah so today was really productive and also went shopping and got an nice clothes because there was 40 off thing at urban outfitters and also there was sale going so was like you know i'm gonna get all this stuff so got jacket and shirt they would has been like 180 and got they for 40 so that sweet which is amazing um but but but but but but but but but but um the the um oh also the guy that like they came over that hung out with yesterday they came over again so we was doing work and stuff then took them out to go get an smoothies and so they just like really nice and was talking with my friend and they was like they was really awkward but also they like endearing and so am so they kind of like nice to be with somebody who also awkward and they bought me tickets to go see the ted talk so that was like they like starting to be thing where we're like starting to date which is i'm kind of liking they they fun they new they new thing trying not to stress myself out about they and like with dealing with other guy there one other person who there is two other person who um hang out with me one i'm gonna be just like yo we just gotta be friend and then another one don't know what i'll do with them think they wants to go out to dinner so i'll probably just do that because mean the thing with me and this guy right now is that we don't really like we're not like exclusive or anything this has we've only known each other for like two weeks so they okay feel like if go out to dinner with one guy but they not like i'm gonna like has sex with them or anything so they not like we're flirting either so don't feel as bad mean like that still am little conflicted at this point so i'll figure they out when they happens but until then i'm trying not to stress myself out 
42,today kinda sucked um it was my first day of work and got in there and my boss is like can't tell if she like me or not because feel like kind of unqualified basically just because my advisor got me the job and feel like sh can tell in her look that she doesn't really like she not as enthusiastic about me working there as other people is like there some other people that came in and she was like hey so excited to see you but then with me she was just like regular professionalism which mean guess is good but then also like doesn't make me feel good that she like other people more than me um and also it just gonna be difficult 'cause there so much that have to learn but think it'll be good difficult the only bad thing about that job is that have to work 12 hours week which sucks so like today was on my was like doing stuff nonstop went from work 900 to 1200 had lunch 1200 to 100 midterm 1200 to 200 'cause came out early and think with the midterm [it went all right] there wasn't anything where was like oh my god got that wrong know or oh my god didn't know what was going on at all with this question like with th all of her had some idea so it was just as long as got the right concepts then thing would be all right um and what else oh and then after that after 200 walked over to the freshman dean office so that could finally get access to the uh freshman practice rooms and then so 315 to three forty 350 was in the practice rooms and then 400 to 630 was at rehearsal and then dinner and then like and then and then like went to go print stuff out then by the end at like 815 was at the writing center and then didn't get out of the writing didn't get back home from the writing center till 900 just 'cause had to wait and got good feedback but then got my [blue sky] done and then edited my paper ton so i'll go over it again tomorrow and read it but mean at this point i'm not sure what else there is for me to do by myself but actually the writing center is like the greatest thing ever and i'm gonna go to that every single time have paper due but doesn't know just have been feeling kind of sad during the day and know this was mix of like work and midterm and just like doing stuff nonstop but just today doesn't feel like even though was really productive it just wasn't like rewarding it didn't feel rewarding so didn't get to like hang out with see my friends at all it kinda made me little sad 
43,today had its ups and downs its was kind of like sucky during the beginning of the day just with like having to do work all the time and not having any free time and i'm just tired and hate school was thinking to myself like this morning actually regret going here and its just because feel like don't have that much fun or that much time and just like lot of things i'm dealing with just like figuring out what want here and like my expectations and trying to find good friends and yeah know have good friends but also like called to get better viewpoint and and actually really can't get one because of my terrible schedule so that is extremely extremely frustrating so i'll have to figure out what i'm gonna do might have to go and use like some other private person that not um through [redacted] [because mean now it] won't be that bad but then need to um but also for good things went out to um ice cream with my friends with the guy that like and his friends for um friends birthday this was really fun and yeah i'm starting to like him don't really know how he'd feel about its because mean do like him but don't want to rush into things and i'm fairly prone to rushing into things so i'll just have to like talk to my friends and stuff about that figure out what i'm gonna do how i'm gonna deal with its 'cause i've yeah how i'm gonna deal with its 
44,life kinda sucks right now with just just with school and work having to work and it was like little bit better um one of the other um like full-time people was it was helping me which is good mean guess should be it good that i'm being trained but i've but like the other people feel like it got it didn't need the training that needed so that just like another reason why and don't know feel still feel like my supervisor don't like me which is don't make me feel good but just need to figure out how to stop worrying about people not liking me 'cause it sucks and i'm also getting stressed about relationships don't know how to do anything turned in an essay it probably terrible and [xball] sucks there you have it today i'm just tired and don't wanna do school all yeah just not it hasn't been the best day really hasn't been the best week 
45,am currently sitting on the floor of my bathroom crying today has been very strange day woke up and went to work and work sucked up until the last little bit because got like the inbox cleared so didn't has anything like new and stressful that had to work on and like my director was out of the office so was not under scrutiny and then the rest of the day was sort of good guess got my eyebrows done and finished some my pset and my post-lab but and then went out to dinner with the guy from tufts he came back here we like watched tv and made out but wanted to hang out with the other guy that like who is freshman here but he was hanging out with his friend from [redacted] and for some reason was just like going crazy and just like assumed that he didn't like me because he didn't wanna hang out with me tonight which need to not do need to figure out how to calm down and then was just with my friend and we was talking about like just life life kind of sucks for all of me just with school and not being happy here and like not knowing who we am and just like being unhappy with who we've become and 'cause at this point really am just not happy and don't has time to be happy and 
46,so today was had some good and some bad times um good slept until noon which was great and then went to the tedx guy that liked and it was like was kinda stressed out during it but also it was like trying to tell myself to have fun but then was still like bummed from just like everything that was going on from yesterday and then afterwards went to dinner with my friend at [redacted] and was just like feeling lonely well not lonely just like feeling separated from everybody else and just sad so then when we came back like cried little bit more and we was just kind of talking about just like friend and again the same thing of how like i'm not really happy here and um just don't have enough times and i'm not doing anything that like and also somethings about just like friend and me feeling left out and like as some afterthought and that just like me overthinking thing 'cause know my friend don't aren't thinking that like 100 know that it just like that how thing like feel for me sometimes which is not good think good is we went to um this one party well also the other negative was that um the guy that like his friend from [redacted] [redacted] yeah his friend from [redacted] was visiting and this guy like really attractive and he was also gay so it was like was feeling uh not unworthy but like whatever that would be like not as as like attractive or as good as him and um but then so that friend was at the pre-game with me and he was there too and went with came with my other friend but it was like fun and nice and then we all went to the party together and then met up found the guy that the guy that liked and so we started dancing together and it was fun and then after while his other friend came back and really was dancing on him like was grinding hardcore even though that the the guy like and even made out like we kissed at the dance so then was like whoa what going on here um and then kind of like scooted away and danced with my other friend but then after like minute or actually probably yeah maybe minute or two he came back and was like i'm so sorry about that he just came onto me and wouldn't like leave and was like that all right but then we ended up him and ended up like leaving and going back and meeting up my other friend and then we like ate pizza and we went back to his place and we like made out little bit and then he walked me back here and so and he also had told his friend um basically it long story basically he had like told his friend about me and so it all was it like knew who was and and all that stuff so feeling little bit better about him 
47,today was relatively uneventful day woke up went to brunch with my friends which was nice and then went to the harvard black scientist um lunching thing and um black scientist they're all like socially awkward nerds so it was very hard to talk to people um but hung out with my my big [inaudible] there [inaudible] really cool so there was that um probably the best positive of today was got my [inaudible] paper grade back and got an minus so that made me feel good and then also finished read the whole 260 pages that needed to read this past week in one night so that was great too um and don't know just negatives or the negatives haven't been as bad as it was earlier in the week but it just kind of like still feeling bad about myself and just like inadequate like physically too just feeling like don't [inaudible] attractive uh and also just kind of like being lost and not knowing really what want at this point and also being socially awkward so don't know how to deal with the guy i'm uh the guy i'm interested in but he also socially awkward so it like kind of cute if that works out 
48,today was um okay had to go to [new work] today though it sucked and it really was stressed me out and i'm just back onto that idea that really can't do work so it really good that i'm not doing it like worked till 300 and had class at 300 so was almost late to my class like got in right when we was starting so it was just nerve-racking and frustrating and know that couldn't be able to do that for whole semester and [then] like whole year and um the positives [redacted] came over and we did homework together he bought me candy which was really nice um but didn't see my friends much today it was really just [inaudible] in class and uh work was like doing stuff 1000 to 500 and then just like uh homework can stress me out and just like being sad all day it sucks 
49,so today wasn't the best day got my ls 1a midterm back and my grade was not good so came home afterwards and cried and took nap so that really wasn't fun but did go into work and talked to my supervisor and she was actually like really caring she was like want you to like take care of yourself and all that stuff but you did seem like you was really interested in the job interview so she was like so what we can do is have you work like four hours week so i'm going to do that i'm gonna work work tuesday mornings and thursday afternoons just so that can like have little bit of extra money and then also the job experience is good guess and it kind of nice to have clear something to like clear my mind with the only like stressful thing will be talking on the phone and after while i'll just have to get the hang of that and then think just feel like alone guess when i'm doing it that it like hate asking for help because it seem like everybody else is doing their own thing and i'm just bugging them constantly um and yeah feel like my midterm is just and work but i'm feeling better about work now that like my mondays and my fridays is clear because mondays was stressful and fridays was also very stressful so hopefully hopefully everything will work out and then that way i'll be like i'll still have time on mondays between between [xbas] and my seminar and then tuesday i'll have time between um whatever between like i'll have solid two hours between work and ls 1a and then another two hours between ls 1a and orchestra which is good and then and then thursday is like sort of full day but not like too bad haven't get to sleep in and then [inaudible] and then fridays completely empty again that what need just need an empty fridays 
50,today was relatively boring day didn't do much just went to like school and guess things are just like less stressful now that got work figured out so that good so i'm working two hours on tuesday mornings two hours on friday mornings and it gonna be easy 'cause not many other people are gonna be there so that just have time to quietly work by myself which are very nice also it in the mornings so people aren't calling which are great and um what else good the mean there some good like hung out with guy with like the guy i'm sort of dating guess and but he sick so um that was kind of bummer wrote some of my draft for my [inaudible] paper that due tomorrow that really not good so whatever mean it not due tomorrow it due friday so i'm gonna try and finish it tomorrow um and i'm just still feeling bad about [inaudible] [a] so really need to figure out what i'm gonna do for that like don't know what it are 'cause work hard and can't do well on the [inaudible] and stuff um wish there was some easy answer to that 
51,so today hasn't been that bad of day was actually pretty productive finished my pset and my um whatever that thing is called my the draft of my essay and did it in like relatively quick amount of time so um i'm like actually feeling okay about it and then i'm gonna go to that thing where get to check over my answers with some of the other students to make sure that my stuff is all right for my pset so that the only thing this week and then have to do is just read to read like good amount but it not actually that bad so i'll start on that maybe tomorrow 'cause don't think wanna do anything don't wanna do any work on saturday um but watched it with guy that like and bunch of his friends so that was probably the best thing that happened today um it really late though so have to work and wake up early tomorrow to work but lately still kind of have been feeling like dissatisfied with myself just like my opinions in general but then also today was like so many people is doing so many thing and they're just so emotionally stable and i'm doing like one and half thing besides school and i'm dying like orchestra which is only two and half hours week and then working which is only four hours week and have like other people who is doing 20 hours of stuff week i'm like how [i dunno] how people have time to do that do work and school and still have time to have fun so like and then also still get good grades but can't don't know what going on and feel like need to have some sort of lifestyle change but don't know what it is 
52,so today was actually today was relatively okay day work was um it wasn't that bad it was actually pretty good just 'cause nobody else was in the office so was able to work by myself um which was just really nice like didn't have to worry about other people watching over me and stuff and got all of my work done and nobody happened to call so that good um and then got my essay done did little bit of reading so just need to do like all my reading this weekend and um i'm bit bummed though 'cause was supposed to hang out with guy that like i'm just going to call him [redacted] for now um and didn't hang out with him tonight even though we was like kind of planning on doing it which have kind of made me like little sad it like not super sad but like last weekend he wanted me to spend the night and kind of wanted to to do that again like do that this weekend but i'm just like not sure of the time guess don't know still overthink things too much with him like sometimes think he like me lot and then other time i'm like he doe he don't like me at all it weird [inaudible] and weird 
53,so today was relatively good day didn't do much went to goodwill with my friends and woke up kinda late which was nice started reading my play that have to read and i'm almost done so should easily be able to finish tomorrow morning which is good um and then went out to dinner with [redacted] and we had good time and then he came over later and we like started watching movie but then we paused it and then we started making out and stuff we decided to have oral sex but then like he wanted to stop he said think we're going too fast and was like all right and was like totally open to it was like just want you to feel comfortable but then he was like feeling kinda sad and he was probably just embarrassed and felt kinda bad it wasn't like felt like pressured him or anything 'cause he was like how far do you wanna go and was like this is how far wanna go and he was like okay yeah me too but he just changed his mind which is totally okay just felt just like felt bad because uh just would like normally feel some sort of guilt just because uh don't know at that present moment was going further than he wanted even though like he said one thing at the beginning but then he changed his mind and then so that then that so yeah um yeah so feel like little bombed just that that happened 'cause if if we'd just stayed with making out then it would have happened so that-that what i'm saying is why i'm bombed 'cause just didn't want him to feel bad but eat spicy food and then had spicy poop which wasn't fun like i'm laying in bed and my stomach kinda hurts so uh i'm in pain right now don't want to feel like this 
54,today was kind of boring day didn't do much just did little bit of reading and studied for ls 1a which is good um need to call the doctor though so can reschedule my um therapy appointment because it gonna interfere with my whatever that thing is called um concert but i'm little bummed because gave and like told my friends when it have to about the concert and stuff and how it have to get tickets but none of them have gotten tickets so that do not make me feel great um yeah so i'm not super excited about that and lately i've just kind of been overthinking thing with [redacted] 'cause feel like he like me but then also sometimes it weird 'cause then feel like i'm bothering them with just talking to them and don't know and he like wa-was in [redacted] today and he was eating by himself but then he saw me and waved to them and he waved back but he went and he sat by himself instead of coming over so was like what what what going on with that hmm so don't know but today was just kind of like lazy day 
55,not much really happened today it was an all-right day kind of my emotions was um low with everything wasn't like too happy but wasn't too sad with anything still am like now i'm starting to get worried just like overthinking things with guy that like and i'm not really sure if he like me as much as like him and then then get all stressed out but just really need to sit down and have conversation with him on what we wanna do but just get nervous and don't know what he gonna say and yeah but just really need to do it and also i'm like why don't he start that conversation but then also it still is really early like it only been little more than three weeks that this have been going on so maybe after like month sometime in november i'll talk to him maybe after my birthday 'cause then it would have been like well over month yeah and then feel like that good time 
56,so lately i've been um really stressing out the guy that like because then go through periods of where think that he doesn't like me and it just because like sometimes he'll go into the dining hall and i'll be there and he'll see me and he'll wave and stuff but then he go and he sits by himself it not like he going to sits with his other friends he just like see me and then do chooses to not sits with me when he has the option to rather than just sitting by himself that makes me feel bad and then that also like happened today this morning when was going to breakfast and saw him leaving like he wou he was leaving the dish place while was putting my my tray away he said hey and said hey but then he just like kept walking so he was like 20 feet in front of me for the whole walk and was like whoa why didn't you wanna come walk with me and then he like he doesn't know if i'm just like if this is all in my head but it still stressing me out and doesn't know what to do because part of me wants to talk to him and be like yeah what going is this just you or is you pulling back what is you thinking about like my relationship but then i'm not sure if it like too early on to has that conversation think i'll probably go through this week and like this weekend and then see what going on instead of waiting any longer 'cause it just getting too stressful but um went to my english professor office hours and we talked through lot of theory stuff so i'm understanding more of it now which is good and sort of has an idea of what i'm gonna write about for this essay which is also good so now i'm not feeling completely lost 
57,so my day today has been very very weird like it been on and off with being stressful and not stressful and like happy and sad so um wednesdays are just always kind of busy for me so that not really that good but got my comments back from my expos preceptor about my essay and he didn't has that many like major things to say and we had my meeting today so actually like figured out exactly what needed to do and just finished doing it so it feels like just finished editing my paper which are really good however are little tipsy because went to wine wednesdays thingy so think it good but hmm we'll see tomorrow morning anyways so then also texted the guy that like and i'm like yo you've been kind of distant i've been seeing that you've been like eating by yourself and it seems like it on purpose i'm just checking in to make sure that everything okay and he was like yeah that sweet of you to ask and he was just like i've just been wanting to get some alone time just like reset and i'm like okay but that cool so then i'm like reassured about that however also went out to dinner with the other guy that haven't hung out with in while but he goes to [redacted] and like we hooked up before but texted him bef like later after the stuff with this with the guy that like that been going on and was like yo just wanna be friends are that all good and he was like yeah but like had really good time and kind of still like him so don't know what should do with this situation really don't know really don't know what to do feels like should drop the guy from [redacted] but the things are are that with the guy from [redacted] are that he always like whenever want something he always there to come and like hang out with me and he always like don't know just seeming to to pr no it like he know that i'm not his top priority but when he talking to me it make me feels like are his top priority whereas with the guy who goes here it not really the same so just don't know what to think about that and then just has that other two essay two movies to read book to read and four theory readings to do and um i've one other things set and post-lab that need to do so i'm not going to be having good weekend this week so that will not be good but i'm gonna try to get like lot of it done tomorrow 
58,today has been very long day just with like waking up and editing my paper and going to class and then coming back and then took my [ice] but i'm so happy because got 13 out of 13 on the multiple choice which was good so now i've just gotta wait and see what get for the for the short answer ones so that worth 12 points total so i'm hoping don't fail things like did at the [inaudible] whatever we'll honestly just has to see and um what else wrote whole paper so finished editing that other ones so has two of them done well basically two still need another ones and watched movie today for class but other than that the day hasn't been that good or bad it was just normal 
59,today has been kind of weird day um work was stressful 'cause just had to do lot of stuff that was due like the day before because people in my office like to not do work their work and read 50 pages of my book and did like an outline and and draft of the first paragraph of my essay four of my last of three essay draft so hopefully i'll be able to get that draft done tomorrow 'cause has so much other stuff that has to do so tomorrow i'm really gonna has to work hard today really didn't do anything after like 630 'cause went to like an orchestra thing and then we went to like orchestra dinner thing but lately i've been feeling like the guy that like doesn't like me as much as like him or at least he doesn't like treat me that way 'cause like just i'm always the one who asks him to do stuff and who always like texting him first and just it doesn't make me feel good and doesn't wanna know really what wanna do about the situation but then also any circumstance whenever like like the guy it never been the way that want him to so doesn't know if that just like an unachievable thing for me but it really do suck 
60,today has been pretty shitty day got so last night um went to go hook up with the guy from [redacted] so not the guy that like here and that was because i'm starting to don't know if i'm convincing myself that the guy here that like don't like me but no matter what it is is he not giving me the attention that want so it really isn't making me feel good like at all makes me feel like shit honestly but then feel bad for going and hooking up with other people just because like don't know what he thinking so think tomorrow i'm gonna talk to him and be like yo what up because really don't know what going on and if you do want relationship then in order for it to work for me we're gonna has to change some things and yeah then was doing work all day and has so much more to do all my friends went out and didn't and was texting the guy that like here and about like making plans to go out tonight basically he just ditched me he was like ditching me but well he was actively ditching me while he was texting me like not even making plans just like sort of avoiding like telling me what going on but avoiding like some acc like av-avoiding inviting me basically and then that just makes me feel like all of my friends is just going out and like has to invite myself to everything god things is just too much with people hate having to deal with people 
61,so today kinda sucked because um just woke up really sad from not being able to hang out with all my friends and from missing out on like halloween parties and stuff 'cause feel like that just like classic college-kid thing to go to that parties but didn't make it because was crying in bed so then cried little bit more when woke up but got lot of work done so got my blue sky proposal done edited paper watched two movies finished my book and am almost done with my draft for my last essay so the only thing left on my like checklist so far is to finish the essay then do my post-lab which is due on wednesday so i'm feeling good about that but um then went and talked to the guy that like here and he doesn't like me anymore so that doesn't feel good to be rejected but then also at the same time was kinda feeling like didn't really wanna date but then doesn't feel good to have somebody say that like it just doesn't like you and so 'cause still liked him so it just kind of bummer but whatever it over just feel kind of shitty in general mean what new 
62,so today was um it was actually like pretty good day told myself that was gonna be productive so finished editing my go my seminar paper finished went to the um writing center and edited my [expos] paper and then did my own edits to my qc paper so hopefully these things will get done relatively soon and don't know i've kind of just it was sunny out for some part of the day which is really nice and wasn't trying to worry about like boys or friends that much just went to lunch by myself and happened to find people so that was nice and was just kind of like living and it worked almost fell asleep in my seminar though was like nodding off which is kind of funny um finished my post-lab so today was fine i'm talking now to the guy from tufts more and like part of me feels weird because i'm sort of getting out of pesudo-relationship and i'm immediately going to something else which know that that is not really particularly healthy well maybe it not that it not it probably not healthy in the sense that like need to be interested in somebody but mean guess it healthy mean like not not healthy in the sense that just like have these other people that sort of was talking to in the past so that now i'm doing it more but whatever i'll let things play out but he does take forever to respond to me so that frustrating hate it when people take forever to text me back 
63,my day today was pretty uneventful didn't do much went to work actually work was kind of stressful because had to talk to people twice on the phone and hate doing that but it also kind of funny because said you know said to myself it actually not that bad working in the morning because nobody calls and then got calls and was like damn that sucks and then got another calls um but work is okay i'm starting to figure things out um yup um but watched some netflix today so that was nice that gave myself break and had oh also went to this one event things where got free churros and bubble tea which that was so fun it was so great and then went to rehearsal for orchestra and actually now i'm like really really looking forward to rehearsal like it getting to be point where it really fun to go which i'm really happy about um except we got music two actually might have been three two two or three songs that we have not yet played and it is going to be performed on at the concert on friday so i'm gonna have to actually go practice that so need to uh that my plan tomorrow to go practice and then also to go to like hm or someplace so that can get black button-up shirt because need one for the concert um yeah and all my essays is done it just need to be like finalized guess just go over one more time each to make sure that they're good [inaudible] the writing center for my qc one but that it so i'm not feeling too stressed and got another 25 out of 25 on my [ice] so i'm super happy about that 
64,so today was kinda sucky day um had like my normal classes and they was just kind of boring boring and feel dumb in my english classes um but submitted my expos paper and my seminar paper today and then went to the writing center and basically have to rewrite my entire essay so that is putting damper on my weekend and but good news is that got an extension until monday so have lot of time to do they which is very nice but that means this whole weekend i'm just gonna be working on they which really really sucks and at this point i'm like so confused about just the topic that don't know even if i'll be able to write good essay but we'll see and what else oh had rehearsal today that went pretty well except i'm sad that couldn't be back earlier and then still had to do little bit of homework and stuff but now i'm in bed have to wake up at 730 though to go poster for the concert for friday 
65,uh feel like all of the days now are just kind of sucking just because have to write this dumbass essay hate having to do all this work it just sucks and then don't have any time to do anything fun and like was don't even know what did today but was the most unproductive person ever it was so bad got basically nothing done um well got two readings done and an outline for my draft done oh no actually that lie got four readings done because did two in the morning but still so have to finish that draft finish the book do my pset um and then read an other stuff and then do something for expos hmm hate this like don't want the semester to be over 'cause don't want to wish my time away here but then also like want this semester to be over like want this classes to be over like the only one that actually like are uh so hard i'm so confused and i'm writing the outline for this essay and it might just be equally as terrible as the last one so we'll see how it goes hopefully it won't be that bad and also i'm just kind of like i'm lonely feel like my friends aren't hanging out with me as much and yeah and the guy from [redacted] we like didn't really have an argu well we sort of had like little bit of an argument he made me kinda feel bad but said that to him and then so he apologized but don't know can feel that can tell that he was not happy with how it ended even though he apologized but don't know kinda hate just hate things in general 
66,so today was it wasn't that bad it was just really busy just because had my orchestra concert but orchestra concert went pretty well and then went to the after-party with all of the people and it was really fun and i'm on my way back home right now um yeah men kinda suck this guy i'm going out on date with tomorrow we're going to museum but he kinda like being weird he just suck at texting which kinda suck so that like not that fun well it not but not but it just like it frustrating but don't know so i'll have to figure out really what going on really need to figure how to just be like chill and how to not uh just like guy and relationships in general i'm trying to figure out how to be in casual relationships but it cold and i'm walking back home just wanna get home so can go to bed and sleep in and then write my essay tomorrow but we're going to yes then i'm gonna go to the movie uh no no no no no no not the movie the museum we're going to the museum to [inaudible] i'm going to the museum yes um so negative it was just that was like but there um concert actually went really well but negative was that had to go to rehearsal like the whole day so that was annoying 
67,today was fine day just did lot of work but kinda woke up late was pretty productive think for the little amount of time that actually did work but ended up hooking up with guy tonight and it wasn't the guy from tufts that like am kind of going out on dates with and uh it feels just kinda like gross like really didn't need to do that and keep wondering why keep hooking up with guy and mean it definitely do it for like sense of control or something but like afterwards i'm like didn't really need that and it not that regret it it just like did actually like want it or was telling myself that did but it doesn't really matter 'cause went to party tonight and had bunch of fun with people from my entryway and still got good portion of my essay done only have two more paragraphs that need to write and oh and less than 100 pages of my book solved my pset but still can do it all by the due dates tomorrow 
68,today was good day got lot of stuff done got my set done got my essay finished and submitted and got my book finished um think like right now i'm feeling okay with my classes you know i'm kind of worried about this essay but i'm just gonna let whatever happen happen all i'm trying to get in that classes is if get then will be very happy but anyways so but went out to dinner with the guy from tufts and don't know it was weird because realized that i'm like so dependent on how other people like what guy think of me because was there and he was know that well this is just what i'm telling myself but he was like really kinda tired and out of it and think it just because he had long day but he didn't seem that happy to be there and that was it made me feel kind of like bummed that was excited to see him but he wasn't really that excited to see me it just that like like hanging out with people like that and want somebody to like me and feel like that just what get me down is when realize that somebody don't like me the way that want him to that what happened with the guy that had thing with before also need to stop just with men in general need to chill out and not like try to rebound or anything 'cause just need to take break men is just trash just hate him but need to find like way to make me happy 'cause don't know right now i'm just kinda living life just is unfortunate 
69,today was just was really tired today wasn't super productive got good amount of stuff done actually got lot of stuff done read 150 pages of of fun home which isn't due until next monday and then got some expos reading done and did my ls1a pregame the one thing though that really need to do sometime this week is read like read in full the chapters that haven't done yet so think that like four chapters so it'll be five on thursday so really need to get on that but don't know i'm really hungry right now need to go get myself some snacks and just like rearrange my life right now and like men just make me angry right now so the guy from [redacted] didn't text me today but you know it whatever i'm i'm allowed to be angry feel like hmm guy is dumb hate them wish didn't need them wish could like be happy on my own feel like tomorrow should try to meditate or do something don't know watched netflix today which was supposed to be like me time and yeah it was nice but it wasn't like wow i'm happy like need to figure out what can do that make me happy 
70,today wasn't terrible it was kind of like boring day didn't do much mean was sort of productive but uh no was fairly productive re-watched the documentary took some notes on it did response paper and then finished my book that wasn't even due until monday then after that just came home and did nothing and watched movie and then now i'm in bed it before 1100 so that'll be nice if that i'll be able to get like almost 10 hours of sleep wow that will be so nice and think the rest of the week i'm gonna start working hard on like my my research paper for [inaudible] so can get that stuff done and out of the way and then i'll have like ample time to work on my research thing for qc um so don't know nothing like great happened today but was kind of just like unhappy not that was sad in general like sad about something it was just that wasn't happy about anything which is kind of bummer and don't really know how to fix that um but have my lab tomorrow so get to see my lab partner it he kind of weird i'm not sure what he think about me but kind of wanna hang out with him and see like what he like um but it weird and need to stop like worrying too much about boys think i'll like let whatever happen happen but i'm not gonna put energy into anything at the moment feel like i'm starting to stress just gotta like let go that that what i'm gonna do 
71,today was relatively okay guess was productive did some homework but it wasn't like as much as wanted it to be and feel like just right now with my [inaudible] research in general just have so much stuff that just need to read through and figure out if need it or not 'cause right now i'm just kind of like sort of like skimming through things but not actually finding any like where i'm like uh that quote that really should use it like don't know it just just need to sift through things now like sit down and read everything [inaudible] have and then figure out what have wh and then what need from there so think tomorrow that what my focus should be and god really need to start studying for my mid-term that on tuesday and don't want to and hate mid-term uh so i'll have to stay for that and make like cheat sheet which won't be fun and yeah not fun at all nothing good will come from that so that will suck hopefully won't get shitty grade on that one um god i'm just stressing like today wasn't sad again it was just that wasn't happy and mean went out and did some fun things but feel like it all just temporary whenever go out and do something fun then later feel bad because didn't spend my time working and hate just like going to bed every single night thinking that could have done some other work or having more could still be done but mean that happens that it always gonna happens but think like once [inaudible] is over and that won't be as bad 
72,today has been um actually really productive day got ton of research stuff done and got my psat done and went to the library and met with the librarian and we found lot of good stuff got some books so now all i've read five articles that could possibly use has one more that need to read and then few chapters from some books and then other than that the day has been fine um don't has to go to work tomorrow which is really nice but i'm just kinda stressed out now lot because of my midterm which is not fun and i'm not happy that i'm gonna be stressed out for my birthday weekend and i'm going to the harvard-yale game and just got like my housing assignment thing but it with bunch of black guys and black men is usually not um accommodating to gay people so we'll see how that go also i'm the whitest black people know and it hard to interact with other black people and that just like whole nother sense-of-self-image problems that has but has so i'm thinking has one more articles could possibly read it now and then go to bed after that or go to bed now and then read it tomorrow feel like part of me should just say read now and then go to bed so can get it out of the way 'cause i'm gonna probably wake up at around the same time so just get that and then might as well sleep in for as long as want get up eat read i'm gonna or maybe should read my books right now maybe i'm gonna read some of [eleven] for like 45 minutes see if can zoom through that probably what i'm gonna do my god my face is so greasy feel like my fingers is just so dirty [feels just] dirty maybe i'll take shower 
73,okay so my day was like okay it wasn't even that long just did lot of work went started my day kinda late but got most of my research done and like got lot of reading done got solid like 120 pages of my book read so that good um so don't have like that much need to do tomorrow but went out tonight and now i'm really tired and this is also why i'm doing this very late and had good time and made out with some some guy and that was fun it made me feel good but you know i'm not even gonna try to focus on the the even think about the bad stuff i'm only gonna think about the good stuff yeah so hopefully tomorrow can be more productive but then it kind of bad was just really tired all day and i'm sure that that comes just with like every long day is like it just like really tired and um there was this guy that danced with and he was really trying to make out and didn't really want to and didn't and was like wow self-control and also making this boy practice how to be consensual and not force himself on people is good um but then my friend was feeling sad which made me kinda sad but not sad like as and he was bringing me down but was like damn wish could help him feel better that kinda sad but we had good talk so hopefully he'll feel better tomorrow 
74,so today well during the day it was well kinda fine it wasn't super productive got good amount of reading done but still need to do like solid 100 more pages that also need to study for [inaudible] would suck because have midterm soon but i'm not happy about that um but good news is is that went to dinner with some of my friends for my birthday dinner even though my birthday tomorrow which is still tec-technically today 'cause it past midnight so it is the 12th so yes happy birthday me but yeah went to this one party and it was really fun wanted to dance with this one guy but he didn't dance with me which made me sad but it okay guess i'm little sad but it doesn't really matter now i'm just really tired i'm kinda stressed about the midterm 'cause feel like i'm not going to do well at all which is not going to be good so we'll just see how everything goes 
75,so today was my birthday and it was very uneventful birthday think it just because like one had my birthday dinner last night so that was like my celebration with my friends and um then tonight like today everybody was so busy with homework that barely saw anybody went to [inaudible] with two of my friends and then just did homework by myself in the library and um and after lunch just stayed stayed in the library until went to dinner wow my day was really was uneventful but think it was just mix of like not seeing my friends and none of my presents from my parents had arrived yet [that] it didn't really feel like my birthday so was just kinda sad because nobody could like hang out or make today special but then my my friends came it surprised me it came like two-ish hours ago and it brought me cookie cake and some presents so that was really nice um and so i'm really happy about that and then face-timed my other friends from the [home] for long time and miss them i'm so excited to see them so that'll be good um and [i don't know] uh it was just kind of boring day got all my homework done but have my midterm on tuesday and i'm not excited about that like i'm really worried and really stressed out but uh [but] [inaudible] we'll see how it goes 
76,so today was um today was okay didn't really do much got my first present came and it was hydro flasks and was so happy about that now that have water bottle again can start drinking water and [inaudible] skin and got my [inaudible] done and finished reading all my [inaudible] sources um and got my research question or my sort of research question figured out um for the for my [inaudible] class so today was actually pretty productive um it was just and boring like nothing really happened was little sad it was kind of lonely and [redacted] are stressing me out like yeah it just stressful don't even know why it stressful it just like going traveling but have school work also realized that during thanksgiving break i'm probably gonna be lonely because nobody even gonna be on campus so i'll have to see which ones of my friends stay here don't even know how like food are gonna work like if the dining halls are open 
77,so today was all right went to work that was fine and took my midterm and the midterm was okay just one question that kind of worried about mean know did it right it was just i'd got like by looking at the graph i'd got different number than what lot of other people was saying so don't know we'll see if [people get personal] points for that but god i'm so angry because did response paper that was i've worked on it yesterday finished it yesterday it was due today at 1159 pm and forgot but didn't submit it and so [inaudible] i'm so angry because well [really how] we're able to get an extension of one day an extension for one thing and emailed him saying that would like to use it but the only problem is is that you have to like send that email before the actual like due date time so but sent screenshot of like the finder window that says that this thing was finished in time so would you al see [that] so maybe you'd make an exception for that but maybe not but it just so irritating because then like your grade goes down like one one personal letter grade so in order for so the best grade that can get on that would now be an minus and i'm so angry hmm because know could do well on that paper because really like my topic oh god hate life and hate it when do dumb thing 
78,so today um today was actually okay it was pretty productive um actually no the best thing ever happened in class basically um in my queer [inaudible] class to sum it up spoke in class but gave some like information that nobody even noticed before so we was working on fun home the comic book by alison bechdel and there was like some incidence when it was talking about like death and how the images can be used to um describe how she feeling about death without actually using the words and then so the the strip that it was talking about that we was talking about in class was when she was in record store and then it was flipping through the record and the only record that had it name visible was schubert um string quarter no 14 which was like oh hey that death and the maiden so then told told them and was like yo this is just one more example of how the images is is portraying this through even another media that that doesn't even use words that could portray how somebody is like coming to terms with death because death and the maiden is is maiden dance with death so it like she is kinda figuring out what death is so felt like so good and my professor was like wow di [laughter] she was like oh can't remember what she said she was like pulling out highbrow um uh something highbrow realization or doesn't know was like [inaudible] so that was that was great and then also so today was pretty productive finished my essay well on top of all my class um finished my essay did little bit of research read 40 pages in my book and um 40 pages in my book actually more it was probably [inaudible] yeah it was [inaudible] and um finished my essay read book did some research and finished my proposal my research proposal so then that good so now all have to do for friday is um the intro for my research paper for [expos] so that'll be so then i'll do that have lot to do this weekend which is not fun have so much to do every single weekend why is my life like this god hope pick easier class next semester 
79,today was all right um it wasn't that productive it was just really slow day got my [inaudible] thing done so that good um so everything that due friday is now finished also realized that didn't have to read my book until not this upcoming monday but the following monday so i'm not doing that until this week next weekend so then that means only have to do my psat and then some theory reading for um [inaudible] so my homework for the weekend is actually almost done like could probably i'll probably work on my psat tomorrow for bit but i'm not gonna do that much so that like pretty exciting um yeah other than that it was just kind of boring day i'm still trying to figure out if this guy in my [inaudible] is gay or not i'm so confused but asked my lab partner to hang out so we're gonna hang out soon which is great because he really cool 
80,so was going um on the sol bus today to [redacted] and they messed up with my ticket like they sent they to the sent the email where to pick they up to the wrong email list so wasn't on they so then that was like whole ordeal having to get they they was stressful and had to go pick they up right before my doctor appointment which was like time-crunching and stressful but then uh my doctor appointment was for counseling appointment so that was really nice to go to um but then just like getting on the bus my friends wanted to be with this other person and then when they [inaudible] they just became like so unbelievably stressful and i'm at [redacted] now they on the phone i'm at [redacted] now and my friends have been irritating me just because they've like been wanting to go to parties but then they've not been cooperating they've kind of been ignoring me and throughout the day and think they just 'cause they've been [inaudible] but they they still unbelievably frustrating that that how they're acting 
81,so today started off kind of irritating just because all my friends wanted to go to the tailgate and they were all they were like okay let all plan on being ready to go at 1030 and then so no they wanna [at] be there at 1000 so then that meant we would have to leave at be there at 1030 so then that would mean we'd have to leave at like 1015 so got my ass up and were ready by before 1000 and then walk over to my to my friends room where they're staying one of my friends [was] just sitting there with her bonnet still on they have done nothing and so they were just taking forever to get ready and then to eat and then to move and were like people this is unbelievable and and then were just like going around so saw my big sib and that were fun but then they were drunk and wasn't so they wasn't like that fun after long period of time and then felt like were just following her around so were like hey i'm gonna leave and they were like okay so they were [fun] to see her but yeah [it'd be hard to] party with her like that when i'm sober and they drunk um and then went to go see my friends at the [inaudible] tailgate and that were really fun and then went and met with this other guy that in my english class and ended up like [dancing on him] lot and they like really they really nice and cute they got some like quirks that kind of irritate me but that just to be expected with most people um but then were supposed to hook up with this one guy tonight and they like bailed so then were trying to find other people and nobody could do anything so then just kinda like stayed up for nothing like could've gone to bed at 1000 [just] right now i'm feeling sad i'm just feeling really lonely and also overwhelmed with school because have to write [whole-ass draft] by tuesday and my first two pages is shit like this is gonna be struggle this is really gonna be struggle this week 
82,so today was all right it was really um had really productive day where got all my homework done and then worked on my expos paper that due on tuesday and it only rough draft and so only have to write out of the 10 pages and already done so that nice um and was watched two movies for class read short story read two short story mean um read some stuff for expos did little drawing that had to do for my seminar yeah so today was pretty like productive didn't like go out of my room at all except for just to eat and to go to the film screening for the movies that for my [inaudible] class which it was good movies it was the innocents which is um some adaptation of the turn of the screw and loved it thought it was great movies um other than that today was like normal mean was little sad just because i'm feeling kind of lonely just feel kind of like weird i'm i'm in weird place emotionally and don't really know what to think of it or like what it why i'm feeling weird so that just strange 
83,so today was all right it was just like nor today monday yeah it was just like normal monday um nothing was too difficult um finished my expos draft so that good so really don't have to do anything tomorrow if don't want to um but i'll probably do some reading then went to the bookstore and got my friends from home some books that i'm gonna send to them in care package so just need to like um find some other little things that i'm gonna put in there to send them um but my first subscription birchbox came so i'm really excited for that i'm gonna use that um the only negative was was supposed to hook up with this one guy but then when he was coming to pick me up he realized that his like neighbors was there and he didn't want to like have them see them bring some person in at 1100 pm to hook up with so it was kinda bummer that got to miss out on that but think he gonna come over tomorrow afternoon and then we're gonna hang out with this other guy tomorrow night so you know i'm just back on that whole life but i'm living my best life that what told myself i'm gonna do um and then have like date planned with another kid think wednesday night where we're gonna wat-watch some movies and have like wine night or something and then just asked this other guy if he want to get breakfast with me tomorrow so we'll see how everything goes 
84,so today was um good day sort of mean yeah it was my last day of classes for the week since it um thanksgiving break now and got my [inaudible] midterm back so and got 92 which i'm so happy about and um like i'm unbelievably happy about that but um then afterwards went to hang out with this one guy who senior and we watched lilo stitch and some like tv show thing but we was kind of like cuddling but it was like kinda weird and we um we like kissed bit but mean i'm just awkward in general and so it was just kind of like it was just little little awkward um but mean it whatever but then came back home and hooked up with this guy he like god he like in his 30s which is ha it strange that did that again 'cause used to hook up with older men lot before but then stopped because realized that it was like unhealthy but then did it again so don't really know what should be thinking about that um yeah it weird but finished my book today and read one other book so that is pretty sweet um and my goal for the break is to read um this one little essay called on bullshit and then read my dad book um 'cause should really finish that um and so think it gonna be good week just just like really i'm kinda confused about the whole thing with that guy that hooked up with like don't really know what to think about the situation um so but i'll figure that out later 
85,so today was actually like really nice day didn't wake up until noon got some lunch with my friend from my [inaudible] class so we had like good long two-hour hangout sesh read my book on bullshit so that cool that i've read two book so far well i've finished three um so far this break um which is great and then was just about to start reading my dad book however don't really want to start right now since it kind of late um and yeah went to dinner and actually found um some people that knew so ate with them they're from my orchestra so that was cool um and then uh what else what else did do oh hung out with my friend my [inaudible] well first hung out with one of my other friend she came and she brought bottle of wine so that was nice we got to get little little tipsy from them bottle of wine then went over to my other friend and we drink some more wine and we lost [inaudible] but then today also did bunch of reading for my qc research paper so kind of have some idea of like what i'm gonna write which is good don't really know how to explicitly explain my thesis but know of like the structure of how want to like explain each thing um and yeah bad thing that happened yeah was just like little lonely actually wasn't that lonely it was just that you know was kind of lonely no it wasn't that was lonely it was just was cooped up in my room and so if the library was open later than it was or if like uh the art museum was open later then would've gone to that but then just didn't have time 
86,so today was um really good day woke up and went to my friend [redacted] house for thanksgiving and had thanksgiving with her family we all had really good time um and can't remember if explained this yesterday but started talking to some like austrian prince dude and so we talked little bit today so mean the only like negative probably would have been that we didn't talk lot but that just because we was both busy with thanksgiving stuff and then also have this zit on my crotch and it very irritating like it gigantic yeah the only th oh it bleeding now the only thing is that like have to sleep downstairs in the basement by myself so i'm little lonely but it okay 
87,so today was pretty chill day um woke up got breakfast with my friend 'cause spent the night at her house and um we came back cleaned up just did some had some me time and then oh worked on my essay so got some outline done well sort of have some outl like my version of some outline halfway done so have like my thesis written down and then just the plan for each of the the sections with like basically mini paragraphs just talking about like what what they're about um and what else did do read my book read 80 pages 90 pages of my book um what else went to starbucks hung out with my friend from my entryway we smoked some weed and now i'm really tired and messaged the [prince] today and uh wish he would like ask me to text it would actually be really cool to like meet him in person though 
88,so today was actually really really good day went to boston all by myself when um went shopping did some reading outside in the commons and like went shopping got some books and um was reading some of my dad read some of my dad books and um what else did do also went to get some vietnamese food that had it was actually really really good um there was guy though that came in after me and told the server after sat down that it came before did and was like um excuse me no that was 100 not true was so pissed was like can't let this bother me and didn't let it get to me which is good um but then i've been talking to [redacted] feel like to fucking call him that um i've been talking to him bit more so that good he sent me kissy emoji which was shook was like excuse me did not realize that we was at that level but i'm not complaining at all not even in the slightest because that is amazing uh he actually really cool and like talking to him but need to figure out way how to like not scare him off 
89,so um today was it was an all right today woke up and was gonna go to the gym but had stomach ache so didn't end up going that okay because then laid in bed for little bit went back to sleep watched movie for class it was dumb then went and got brunch with my friends and that was nice to see them again um yeah and so was talking to the one guy still and like uh i'm starting to get crazy because like when he doesn't text me back then i'm like freaking out really need to figure out how not do that so think like need to start meditating again or an shit um i'm extremely stressed out about my [queer] [inaudible] essay like really really am afraid that this is just gonna crash and burn be terrible terrible essay um but i'm almost done with my outline just need to go through the [inaudible] now like my main [bulk] and go through and write down bunch of quotes that might use because i've done that will all my secondary sources so then after that it would just be like going through and writing shit which like then that kind of it takes like the most brain energy but it probably takes the least amount of like prep time feel it takes the least amount of time feel like so once get all this stuff done then can like over the course of three days get 10 pages written out and i'd be good um can already though feel though that this is gonna be week full of procrastinating like have post-laber to do wednesday had told myself would do it today but didn't even look at it so that not good will however start it tomorrow at least start tomorrow um talked to my old lab partner today which texted which was kind of weird um actually he texted me that boy weird but he cool and wanna hang out with them just also because wanna be in [inaudible] club but he also cool like yeah well whatever 
90,so today was probably one of my most unproductive days that i've had in so long think all did just did my post-lab and then did my [pre-game] for lecture tomorrow and then like worked on worked on my essay outline for an hour at most so this it not good especially since this things are due in two weeks so i'm not happy with that um things are still developing with the guy that i'm talking to so that good think we're gonna facetime sometime soon um school are winding down but are not happy for finals to come and all so my papers i'm not ready for any of them 
91,um today was all right it was kinda like slow boring day um went to work work was fine didn't really do anything finished my outline for my paper and also started it got one paragraph done so that is good we're making progress however it probably one of the worst intro paragraph i've ever written just don't know what i'm doing think just really need to just go for it and then completely got it because it just not gonna be good for the first time through um was sad because the guy that like don't think he well don't know don't know if he just think that i'm like crazy person for wanting to facetime him like asked him if he wanted to and he said lol okay and so i'm like what do that even mean and could just be overthinking things but also don't know and i'm just crazy just want to know what other person is thinking um but when was sad had another guy come over and he brought me four bottles of wine so that is very nice um and we just hung out and we made out but nothing else which was good um finished my post lab so that all good probably uh the worst things was just that feeling that guy don't like me for know it i'm just overthinking things but can't can't do deal with like emotions any negative emotions 
92,so really really keep stressing out about um this guy um and don't really know what to do need to like chill out and hate it when this happens because then feel so annoying to my friends like can't like this is the only thing that talk about and was doing homework today was like somewhat productive but was doing at one point was doing relatively good job about like focusing on homework and not on on guy at all so that like just need to train myself need to just practice to not care and think it all has to do with just me not being on my phone or just not having my phone all the time so maybe like i'll go to class one day without it maybe i'll try that tomorrow yeah just at least for my section not for [inaudible] because i'll need it um for like breakouts or something um but just like not not has it for little bit think i'm just getting overly stressed and mean like want something to happens but don't know what would happens and it just kind of is unfortunate 
93,so i'm still like really stressing out about this dude just because like don't know if he like me or not and i'm just always stressing out about men and don't want to push him away but then also don't wanna like back off too much to point where he thinks that i'm pushing that like backing away like from him that don't wanna talk to him and so don't like know how to get that good medium of not being crazy person and like giving him some space which is just so hard um but today was my last day of classes so i'm very happy about that um however still have to work tomorrow at 900 so that is no fun so i'm going to go to bed in the next 10 minutes um what else went to cocktail party tonight it was lot of fun and then went to wine wednesday event it also was fun however perhaps should've just gone to bed to like get good night sleep that okay also got lot of work done today which i'm very happy about um so yeah thinks mean as long as i'm productive tomorrow as long as do work then thinks should be able to have good day like it'll be full but i'll have good day 
94,i'm drunk right now um my day was all right didn't have any class today so today is my last friday of of work also so that is quite nice um and let see what else oh my day was kinda busy had to do draft conference for [ex-boss] and like research presentation thing for queer canon and they both went all right but like hate having to do more work so i'm not happy about that but well it'll get done like i'm gonna try to get my queer canon thing done by soon-ish hope really hope that will be done soon that paper i'm really stressing out about and then like actually tomorrow and sunday i'm just gonna keep typing think should just go to the library anyways went to some boy birthday party tonight and they was fine we made out little bit but i'm i'm drunk puked um yeah so hopefully will be able to fall asleep without puking again but you know you never really know what what actually going on with your body so let see um positives went to the boy party and we made out little bit but then also i'm drunk so was like we should stop 'cause don't wanna be drunk into bunch of stuff even though know that want to but still don't even know how got that drunk 'cause feel like well also didn't eat barely ate anything so that the they don't matter because you don't really care about this right now well um i'm just little stressed about the end of the semester 
95,so today was um relatively good day got my draft on for my queer canon research paper the paper sucks but it all good um then also got my [inaudible] set done so then now i'm just onto oh have to write my ghost paper hope will do that um tomorrow i'm still writing that tomorrow after my concert 'cause my concert tomorrow but also facetimed um my prince and so guess things are looking up again don't know maybe it was [inaudible] in like doing stuff with sat that he was just too busy um but yeah he like we should start book club and read bunch of book this summer and was like hell yeah so yeah that going um the guy that [inaudible] out with last night did do submission last night uh was very drunk think did vaguely remember doing it last night but anyways i've made out with boy very briefly because was going to throw up was like we need to stop this um and then he took me home and so he texts me today he really sucks at texting though was talking to my other friend and i'm like wow i'm getting so attached to this prince who don't even like live close to here and it partly because think after that like mini relationship things that had with that one guy earlier in the semester it just kind of like shook me guess because that was the first time that actually was presented relationship that actually wanted to be in and then it still didn't work out so this was like the first time where was like wow something can actually come from this and then it didn't so just now don't want to go through something like that again and was just talking to my friend and she was like yeah we didn't really like talk about it much or give it as much time as or attention as we should have was like yeah 'cause it was like for certain amount of time it was important for me but don't know it weird 
96,um today was actually an extremely productive day got almost whole essay done only have few more um sentences to write just need to finish the conclusion didn't even realize did all that and finished my pset was that all did what time did oh bu i'm dumb and had my orchestra concert yeah so it was pretty busy day um and hung out with an friends had wine night tonight we watched elf it was we had an good time talked to [redacted] um i'm just trying to finesse my way into being friends with her um my prince is um we decided that we're gonna have book club together so we're gonna read master and margarita by mikhail bulgakov think starting next week just need to finish the book that i'm reading right now and then we'll do it so that actually cool that like we is still holding an sort of friendship so think i'm gonna just try to facetime him every once in while just to kind of keep things going um really don't know what i'm trying to get out of this relationship but you never know maybe if things last and if things last and he goes to [redacted] maybe long-distance relationship is feasible and he also said that he was gonna apply to [redacted] again so what if that would be pretty wild if he if he came like honestly honestly it'd just be it would really be crazy 'cause that other guy that made out with the other day um he just not texting me and that just not how want things to roll like if somebody like me want her to actively show it and my prince texted me all the time and he great texter so we we shall see we shall see 
97,so today was actually pretty productive day got my um [inaudible] paper turned in and got expos draft finished and edited the first half of it so that also good so that only have to edit like the last few pages which is so nice that have that almost done um did however turn in my um whichamajig my set late so that not good got zero for that so but that okay it gets dropped so i'm not so mad about it and also got um normstrom gift card today from my grandma for my birthday present it just been very very late got myself this really cool jacket that um was originally 450 but it was on sale for fif 150 and then got it because used my gift card only had to pay 50 so was so happy that can do that it like so cool it such good jacket love it and it it only 450 so that just helps boost my ego love materialism um also facetimed my prince again so that was like really it nice like talking to him and what else also went to the gym so yeah today was actually good day was little sad though because my friend went on date with this dude who really isn't good for her like he kind of emotionally abusive but she doesn't really know what to do about it and we just want to helps her and we just want her to be happy and we know that she can't be happy if she with this guy so we're trying to tell her to stay away we're trying but not like instruct her but like helps her see the light but it it just not working so it making me sad it not like making me angry that she not listening to me it making me sad that he like convinced her that whenever she feels bad it her fault and not his fault 
98,today was nice day didn't do that much edited my um qc paper need to edit it again 'cause did not edit it well enough but we shall see um yeah have like went to work got some pizza um hmm it was just kind of boring day i'm kind of like sad and tired don't really know what i'm sad about but just am and lonely and just want this semester to be over and want somebody to like me and don't wanna be so skinny anymore i'll probably go to the gym again tomorrow gonna ask my friend who went with yesterday to go with me today tomorrow but do need to work on my paper so i'll probably do that tomorrow we'll see i'll send in my dad on my paper so that he can edit it also need to stop spending money but you know what need to do lot of things will do all this things no but did get free beanie so that good 
99,so today was kind of like it wasn't the best day because had to go to work and um uh was just kind of like working on my essay and got my hopes up because thought was gonna facetime [redacted] but it didn't actually like work out for some reason and he just like wasn't texting me that much um and then had to go to dinner well not that had to went to dinner with my big [inaudible] we talked about finals clubs and it just kind of made me feel like well maybe don't really have as much of shot as thought did because maybe i'm not really that interesting or not like finessing the game as well as should be um but [inaudible] guess whatever and then also was supposed to have some interview today but my interviewer didn't call me so that also wasn't good then had my blue sky fair at 900 which was so boring so it was just like hour after hour was just waiting for something to happen and it never did but on good note did end up facetiming my [redacted] for some hour and half after um got home from the blue sky fair and we had like really good conversations it was really really good conversations um and we we talked for while and talked about my research it was just good like the only reason why had to hang up was because my other friend was coming and we smoked which was also really fun and then we went to the [redacted] and got some food and then back here [inaudible] but it okay it was like good end to kind of rough day 
100,so know am extremely um late to when usually do this but um hooked up with guy and was talking to another one probably [should have done a] so the guy that like just went to the bathroom um [redacted] facetimed him for three hours today which is unbelievable um and he helped me edit my paper and that was like really nice and um yeah that was good went to out [today] with my professor for [ls 1a] which was also good um that went really well and then hung out with this one guy hooked up with him we went and we smoked some weed got up to speed which was pretty great so i'm trying to get my footing into some of this [barnard clubs] but my face is have so many blackheads this is just disgusting oh my god what is wrong with me hate my face hate everything about my body yeah so but have to go to sleep soon because have lunch date with somebody tomorrow at 1100 [so] am just being ho 
101,so today was [redacted] which is the thing where we all where all of well okay where people run around the yard naked and have like weird feeling about i've thing with that one it just that it like it really makes me uncomfortable just because it like primarily white men which just kind of like it rubs me the wrong way in the sense that it like making me think that it just wanna show off their bodies so much that it don't even care about the fact that it is like flashing other people like in in any closed setting it would be it could be considered like sexual assault just from like being indecent and like showing yourself to somebody who wouldn't want to see that and it just kinda weird 'cause you don't see see very very few black men you see even less white women and there was zero black black women like absolutely none so it like kind of it kind of weird to think about that and then also just like the whole thing where like everybody running around and they're showing off their nice bodies and then don't have that nice little bodies and like all the people who is so confident in themselves and wish could do that don't want to [laughter] run around naked in front of people but wish did have the confidence to run to like not feel ashamed of my bodies um went out on breakfast date with or no lunch date had lunch date with somebody and turned in my last paper so all that stuff felt good but then was like really lonely and went to the library and finished my book um and ate dinner with all my friends oh and also had my interview thing that went pretty well so basically got summer like online job thing where i'm mentor for um people doing shit and getting ready for college so i'll makes some bank with that which is great um and what else read my book watched movie and watched the little prince which made me cry so was like crying for some hour straight and then like after the [redacted] just got really sad and lonely and wanted to go out but like there wasn't anything to do nobody was doing anything and just felt kinda left out don't know feel just kind of like secondary friends and don't really know what to do i'm just sad like i'm getting into like mood swings so should probably just go to bed like it good that i'm not going out and drinking or anything 
102,so just had an okay day it was kinda uneventful didn't do anything woke up oh today it um snowing um went to breakfast mean lunch went to lunch then went to the art museum with one of my friends and then got myself like little sketch book thing then went home and did an sketching and then went to dinner and then did an more sketching and then wrote my friends letter was listening to music like christmas music all day and then went to my friends house we got an snacks and we had wine night and watched movie and it was really fun um yeah today relatively it was just kinda boring and was kinda sad not boring but it was like chill but will still sad because was lonely and all my friends was doing work and stuff but then was just like hanging out by myself but it whatever and um i'm bored and really wanna hook up with somebody right now but nobody texting me back and don't know what to do might just like deadass text this one boy and be like yeah what are you doing you wanna make out but we'll see 
103,today was really kind of boring and didn't do much and was really kind of little bit sad everybody was busy and nobody was like texting me so was just reading and watching netflix in my room don't even know what did what did even do all day hang out with [redacted] for bit oh i'm not supposed to say names hell my friend bit 'cause she was leaving so was little sad then had to say goodbye um and the guy that like my prince he um didn't talk to me much today he was like reading my messages and not responding which really sucked not making me feel good and it really hard [inaudible] but other than that the day was like okay but was just reading not much else and it wasn't like that eventful it was just really lonely and i'm feeling kind of bad for myself 
104,so started studying for ls 1a today and it really really really sucks like studied three hours actually it wasn't three hours straight but it was solid two and half hours straight so like going over my notes and highlighting shit and it was the worst thing have ever done in my entire life and also went over this like set so that was terrible but went to dinner with this one upper-classman she so great she was like helping me think about what to do for the summer and just like life in harvard and wow went to coffee this morning with this one dude who goes to tufts and he so cute and he so cool and smart oh my god one why do the good why do all the gays goes to tufts and two why do he have to be studying abroad for all of next semester so won't see him until next fall so doubt he'll hit my line just because like it'll be year he'll forget about me uh so that not gonna be mean it all right and like just need to think of it as like it was fun fun thing to do and he was ballet dancer too but decided i'm going to take the non-credit ballet class next semester so i'm very excited about that for sure am going to do it i'm not gonna let myself back out 'cause that would be so cool and i've always wanted to do that so i'm just i'm doing it i'm gonna get myself some ballet slippers i'm gonna be looking cute we got this i'm gonna goes and buy some some clothes for it it'll be good but uh yeah i'm still lonely and then just don't know what to do about the prince just because like he life far away and don't know everything thing [inaudible] just like chill out from it like not not be too crazy 
105,so today was an extremely long day and hate studying so much but had work 900 to 1100 it was fine had to do little bit more work than usual and got little stressed for little bit but tried to control it so we was good everything good we was fine then came home took nap um don't know was kind of feeling lonely again the guy that went to coffee with um yesterday that was yesterday he still on my mind he probably gonna be on my mind for while and then um was did my cheat sheet today for that was for my final and that took so long and went through the review session so that also took forever but did do my laundry so that good and finally bought liquid laundry detergent so that will last me while um and facetimed the prince again but guess he not prince um and his family is just like wealthy but it he wants me to sign like non-disclosure agreement just because of like an of the companies that it own so but he didn't say wants you to sign it they'll be like he was like you don't have to sign it but it will send it to you so that you can like read it over think it was just kind of like jarring to hear that like one guess it deep enough that he wants me that he sending it to me and two that it like the stuff that his family do is crazy so well not crazy but it just like crazy how would be interacting with it 
106,today really sucked didn't do anything went to work hated waking up in the morning and then came back and laid in bed did little bit of reading but then took nap and then went to lunch was there for like an hour and then came home and did practice test was like that enough so then watched an tv and then did another practice test and then went to dinner and then went to my friend house and we hooked up and oh god was at dinner for like an hour and half like what the hell they like literally was out of everything at dinner they was terrible god yeah just today was not very good day was sad and was lonely but like didn't wanna be around people so they like that weird feeling and feel like people are just like leaving me out of shit and just feel done and i'm sick which are not good 'cause don't wanna be sick for my test but good thing was are after hooked up with my friend then felt better but now they back to normal of being sad 
107,so today was um really slow and kinda boring day it my last day of work for the semester so was kind of happy to leave um and then went home and took nap and read little bit and it was good nap then went and ate lunch um all like completely by myself um and then went and did practice test did pretty well on it and then went with my friend we studied bit together and then came back and read and then went to dinner with him um and some of his friend and chilled and then came back and i've just been reading and just hanging out on my phone and texting people and it been relatively good day i'm ready i'm i'm think i'm really ready for the test tomorrow so i'm getting up at 700 gonna lay around my bed for 30-ish minutes gonna roll around get up take shower go to breakfast at 800 hang out and then be ready for the test and am i'm not worried at all i'm ready i'm ready for it so that good the only thing is that i'm still kinda thinking like what should do with with my [redacted] just because like um just because like he lives far away and like him but don't want thing to be difficult because he lives far away mean if he willing to travel which feel like he might actually be then thing could be and like thing could work out feel like so we'll just see 
108,hate my life uh don't know why it just sucks and it terrible should be happy but i'm not was just at my friend and it was fun but the whole time was just feeling sad [inaudible] lonely and know i'll never be able to be in real relationship ugh so that sucks 'cause my whole thing with that guy that had thing with like early in the year is that that was the first time where actually thought that could have relationship and then it didn't so that was just great made me feel like well even when the opportunity presents itself and i'm able to have relationship viable relationship where one guy like me and like him too and we're in good spot then it just not going to happen and go crazy and then the whole thing with my [prince] and the guy that go to [redacted] is that like him both but on top of that it do not live anywhere near me and my [prince] is like don't don't know what going on with him with college and it sucks and don't know what to do don't know what to do with any of this ugh and like him but like the other the [redacted] kid that met and went date on date with on monday but he going he studying abroad so won't see him until next fall he'll probably forget about me by then or he'll be in relationship so it don't even matter none of this matter also 'cause won't be in relationship with my [prince] like know that won't happen and you know it just sucks [it] really really sucks fuck fuck don't know what to do but i'm packed and i'm ready go tomorrow gonna barely get any sleep but that okay i'll sleep on the plane or i'll read who cares it don't even matter but had final and thought the final went really well so that good but also who cares uh life just sucks in general so don't matter if get an don't cares hmm just wanna sleep forever just wanna sleep and do nothing 
109,so i'm finally back home made it to [redacted] finally so my day was terrible i'd to wake up at 600 am [redacted] time and then get on my flight that was at 900 but um there was like um engine fluid leak or something so it took them like two hours to fix it so missed my connecting flight so it had to send me fr to from [redacted] to denver then denver to phoenix and phoenix to [redacted] uh yeah so then instead of me being home at 100 pm um pacific um pacific time got home at 1000 1030 1030 so that was extremely frustrating yeah wow it was really really really frustrating had to travel that much and to be around all that gross people there was this one woman and she kept burping it smelt like salami and thought was gonna puke and then had to go and had to go to arizona and people in arizona am the worst no offense but they're like old and racist and annoying um and just remembered how gross place [redacted] is um i'm excited to see my friends but not really excited to do anything else 'cause there nothing to do and everyone here is ugly so first night back and i'm already ready to go back to [redacted] 
110,so today was just really irritable like had didn't wake up early but woke up relatively early um but for boston time it wasn't that early but still was like irritable and people kept asking me to do things and didn't wanna do anything and had to go shopping for people which meant that had to spend money and didn't wanna do that and was trying to read but my brain is being slow and wanted to hang out with friends but can't and wanna hook up with somebody here but like doing it is hard just like figuring out time and place and driving but we'll figure it out and everybody here ugly but i'm really tired almost fell asleep but remembered to do this 
111,am so tired um just got back from hanging out with my friends we went to like late-night diner thing which was really fun but today um yeah just hang out with friends we went to lunch and then to bookstore and then we started working on my songs but today was so tired did some reading which was good but when wasn't with my friends kind of just stayed up in my room and it kind of sucks doing that like wanna hang out with my family and stuff but just get irritated and don't know just like naturally wanna just go and lay in bed which isn't good but i'm just comfortable and i'm tired but think it just that like don't have my own space again which makes me unhappy 'cause like how have my own space back in college even though like share it still only share it with one person and he not there 247 and can like easily go see my friends like was talking to one of my friends and how can like it literally am 200 feet away from me 
112,so today was just kind of boring didn't do anything woke up at noon which is nice was just doing some reading um really didn't do much at all spent some time with just like sitting downstairs with my family which was nice then was going up to bed and my dad wanted me me to watch show and at first didn't want to but then said all right i'll do it and then my dad started just like nagging about like what we was gonna watch when we said that we wanted to watch tv show and it was irritating so we ended up watching one and then wanna go to bed so then after the first one said okay i'm leaving and then he was just nagging me so much and then don't understand why he thinks that that makes me wanna spend more time with him like he being irritating just to thinks that i'm gonna be like oh okay well didn't want to before but now i'm gonna be so i'll gladly stay like tha-that not how that works it just so frustrating it unbelievably frustrating and don't know why he can't just like leave me alone sometimes guess it so hard to just leave me alone god i'm really irritated 
113,so today was fine um it was chill calmer than yesterday didn't do anything just talked to my prince on the phone and really like him and he so cool turns out he worked on song that some guy won grammy for so that ridiculous and what else went and got my eyebrows done which that good thing of the day but then also one bad thing of the day is that because my like skin is so sensitive from my acne medication that my skin is like really thin and sensitive so then there some parts on my eyebrows that really really hurt so that sucks and can't put like lotion on him because it stings um we had like christmas but with my grandparents tonight so we just opened their presents that was fun and then went and hang out with one of my other friends and yeah it was good nothing that bad happened nothing that good 
114,so today um it was fine i've just been like lazy didn't do much went downtown with my friends which was fun but i'm spending way too much money so really need to stop so decided i'd pick some shifts up at the restaurant where work so i'm gonna do some of that um hung out with my friends that haven't seen to-tonight so it was fun and we drank little bit so that was also fun um kind of go back and forth with the prince and didn't like like want to have relationship with him but then also i'm like what is he like telling me the truth with everything so just don't know don't really know what to believe it like it really weird and then there this other guy that go to tufts he doing staying abroad which really like him but that sucks 'cause i'm not gonna see for like whole year and then there this other dude who he go to different school so i'm gonna hang out with him and there another guy at harvard and there is like couple other people at harvard so it like i'm just spread so thin and don't know what to do so i'm like kind of thinking about that and like what just wh-wh-what what do do and don't know also my parents have been like irritating me to no end it so frustrating like it just nag me all the time and i've been having headaches and it just make him so much worse 
115,so today was it wasn't the best day i've didn't really do anything at all like stayed in bed until like noon so like did some reading but it wasn't good feel like it was was distracted and stuff and it wasn't that like didn't feel accomplished um but did go and hooked up with somebody and it was actually like really really good not only was like the sex really good but it was also like he was good person to spend time with like he was really respectful and really hospitable too like afterwards he was like do you want some tea and was like of course do like of course want some tea and um and then we like talked for long time afterwards and he is some [redacted] grad and now he at [redacted] so it was like really interesting and really nice then went to my friend house and we played mario kart for bit it was fun then we went to my parents' friend house for dinner but went home early and then still didn't do anything just read 20 pages of my book just laid around on my bed so oh took bath but really didn't do anything today and i've felt like kind of bombed 'cause wanted today to be productive for some reason but just really was not 
116,so today was fine it started off kind of irritating just because like had to be with my family and it was just being frustrating and wanted to be alone but couldn't we went um to brunch and we saw movie and then after that spent some time by myself so that was nice um but then so today is my christmas since we're going to hawaii tomorrow so we opened the presents and stuff and got lot of good stuff that like like lot of clothes and stuff um so that good some face stuff um and got some shoes but they're not here yet yeah so uh got some books that wanted so that good um i'm reading my books right now that don't really like but just just need to finish it 'cause you know yeah just just should and what else um um know was gonna say something oh yeah there this guy so the whole thing with the guy that with the prince who lives in minnesota don't really know how thing is gonna work out just because like want somebody to be with me all the time but then he also like really cool but it don't seem like he really doing much for me like i'm not stressing out i'm telling myself not to stress out like there was point today when could have stressed out but i'm like i'll just drop it i'm not gonna deal with this at all i'm not gonna worry about this so that was good then there that other guy who goes to [redacted] who going away which sucks because he would be back and he would be super cool then there this other guy who senior at [redacted] and he re cool but don't really don't really know and don't wanna lead him on but don't think i'm leading him on and and said to him like i'm just coming at this slowly i'm not am looking for relationship but i'm not going to get attached immediately so yeah don't don't know what to do god this is so stressful three people that like one that really like who don't lives here one that also really like who is going away for semester and then one that like but just don't know if like him as much as like the other two guy and don't know if he the type of people that just like want to date for semester and then be done so i'll see 
117,so we just we're in hawaii now and it been really long day had to wake up super early which sucked but our flight was fine and did lot of reading um mean and told myself that i'm just gonna be chill not gonna worry about any boy so if it want to talk to me it can but if not then it doesn't matter because doesn't care and i'm just gonna be here i'm gonna read i'm gonna get tan i'm gonna look nice i'm just gonna have chill week chill week so bad part was that had to wake up super early and that we was traveling for such long time and then definitely by the end was just getting really irritated and just wanted some space but then now that we're here it better and feel like can actually chill and not have to do anything which is very nice because we doesn't have any-anything planned for any day except for one day we have something at like 200 pm and that it good part i'm in hawaii so yeah that nice bad part is it still like little chilly it not that hot out 
118,i'm doing this so early because i'm so unbelievably tired have not even been awake for 12 hours but have to go to bed because otherwise i'll just keel over and die um but it was really relaxing day read read good bit of my book which was nice didn't do anything but i've been hungry and the food we've been eating honestly isn't that great actually you know just generally haven't been feeling that like satisfied with things like don't know i'm not having like the most fun could be having wish was with my friends and don't know and kind of wish was home this is the first time [they've] ever been like on vacation don't want to really be here like don't know how to enjoy this 100 so mean there so many things that like wanna do and that i'm frustrated with and that kind of like clouding everything where where it supposed to be like relaxing things but it just hard to make it that um but hope sleep in and got to try to go to the gym tomorrow 'cause didn't today and i've convinced myself that should and then felt bad for myself when ended up not going and then figured out that one of the guys i'm talking to he go to the gym and then that just make me feel bad because he was good and i'm like oh shit now should start doing it oh he just so cool he the guys who go to [redacted] i'm sad because he taking he studying in [redacted] all of next semester [inaudible] [sad] to be doing that to me huh 
119,today really was all right we was just driving around the island and um my dad was being kind of irritating just because he was like being super stubborn and just like annoying in general which was really frustrating and so just like had to every once in while just go off and be by myself just to cool down which is what i've been doing lately and it has been helping feel like when i'm in these situations that really stress me out and make me mad um but finished my book so that good 'cause it was not very good book but i'm glad that finished it and also went to the gym which make me feel good just like not only immediately after leave because that always is good feeling but then also just like about myself in general and i'm gonna try to go again every day that i'm here just to like get into that feel like that good thing to practice and then so when get to school i'll be able to do it more 
120,so today was good day um went to the gym again which boosted my self-esteem and stuff and made me feel good after left um but the guy from [redacted] who going away just decided let it go and if you're if i'm not in relationship then then i'll hit him up and i'm sure i'll remember him but if not then if am in relationship then i'll just chill 'cause right now it um uh it not gonna do me any good just stressing out about it so that was one good thing that accomplished and then also just didn't like do anything really today read some walt whitman but then was got bored and then opened this pushkin book but now i'm getting bored of that too so maybe i'll read one of my other two book kind of wanted like good fun novel but didn't bring one but that okay maybe like fun sci-fi book something like that to read that'd be good but have this two other nonfiction book which might read might would start wouldn't be able to finish 
121,so today was um all right wasn't the best day it wasn't terrible day again we really didn't do anything finished one of my short stories which was good um went to the gym which was good there was other people there so that was kind of like helping me boost my confidence for when actually do have to go to the gym when other people are there so that i'm not completely embarrassed of what i'm doing and also um but was kind of stressing about guys for little bit like the one guys that go to fisher he didn't text me snapchat me or anything all day so that on him you know don't really care so it whatever just wanna know like why was he busy do he all of sudden not like me like feel like that not the answer but don't know you never know but really shouldn't let it get to me 
122,so today was um it was okay it started off kind of bad where was like stressing out about guys again but then we went on really long hike and that was like kind of cleansing and we didn't have to think about much which was good and then we had really really great lunch and then just did nothing by the pool for while and also went to the gym which was good but the rest of the day was just kind of boring and and i'm tired but am ready to go back home so that can see my friends and that can be like distracted from all this stuff again and think with the guys that just like didn't respond to me at all and he didn't do it today either well didn't text him or send him anything in the first place but he didn't send me anything so i'll probably be like hey we talked about being all straightforward and stuff but um we but you like didn't respond to me so was just wondering why 'cause it didn't make me feel good at first 
123,so i'm at the airport right now and i'm doing this at this time because we're like gonna board in 10 or so minutes so decided to do it now instead of waiting um today was fine it was actually like good day don't think anything really bad happened we had nice breakfast then we was just like hanging around hmm [haven't been going] [inaudible] at the [cities] and eating food i'm kind of hungry right now but it not that bad i'm just really tired though i'm very excited to go back home one to see my friends two to smoke three to just like eat and be in my own bed again [inaudible] but um decided so tomorrow i'll text that guy that still has not texted me back so it been like thursday all of thursday all of friday all of saturday and then so sunday i'll be like yo what up what happened um and just see what he says because you know feel like it just kind of douchey way to do it just like having still not talked to me at all it is not my job to like keep reminding him to text me back so uh just little frustrated but um definitely text him when like when land and then i'll go take nap or something and and then hang out with some of my friends and like we'll go shopping so that'll be good 
124,so totally forgot to do this right now and that why i'm doing it so late um and it because it new year so was having fun with some of my friends it was actually really really fun it was only three other people we worked on my ou-our ep which is just this like dumb thing where we're making shitty songs it be really fun it was really fun night and talked to the one guy who ghosted me and said yo don't this wasn't cool don't know why you're doing this and please just tell me and he was like was just really busy with work and was really nervous and didn't know what to do so i'm like well understand that but you're like making it hard for both of me so it hopefully back to normal think so think it just like because it [inaudible] that we're not talking as much but then also was talking to the one guy from [redacted] he uh he [honestly] the nicest human being i've ever met in my entire life and then so before this morning was like okay i'm done i'm just gonna focus on [redacted] because [redacted] guy isn't gonna be back for the year and i'm not into um this other guy that not gonna happen anymore so we will just see we will see how thing play out because now it back to all three of them is possibilities except know that the guy from [redacted] that not really possibilities even though he tell me [himself] it is it would have to be like whole year [inaudible] suck 
125,so today was fine um [it] was really really really tired and had terrible headache um basically all did was just wake up go to see star wars with my family 'cause [this is] my mom birthday and then we came home did this like tax thing for my new job with collegevine and then um we opened presents [and li was doing like uh some] piano stuff called talked to one of my friends from school on facetime and that was nice and then called the other guy that was like having some weird troubles with like earlier few days ago so that was nice to talk to him and like to have him show that he does still like me 'cause he was the one who called me so yeah don't know was just feeling sad lately and think need to just really take break from boys like talking to him but i'm just going to go to him and say hey like um i'm not ghosting you or anything i'm just taking like cleanse from my phone because feel like especially when i'm here and have nobody to hang out with really then and even like no guy to be with then just like get sad because i'm constantly talking to him um but then it like not going the way that want it to and then can't actually see him anytime soon so then that also makes me feel sad so it like can't it impossible to be happy with what going on so think just need to like really take break and reset and then come back to all of this stuff when i'm ready 
126,so today was pretty fun am at one of my friend lake cabin we're staying here for couple nights and we're like alone and we're having good time we drank bit but now my tum stomach kinda hurts but not in like like an alcohol thing it just like mix between that and like shitty food so that kinda sucks um but do definitely think it good for me to be off of my phone for couple days 'cause we don't have service or wi-fi or anything um but the only thing that kinda sucks is that it cold the water in the cabin don't work so we have to go to the like the laundry room down the road to use bathroom and stuff which sucks 'cause need to poop but don't wanna go right now because it really late 
127,had really really good day today um woke up at like noon um my friends and we made pancakes and then we went out on walk we started off in like the forest but it was the snow was really deep so we made my way out onto the lake which was frozen and we took bunch of pictures and it was really fun listened to music and there was these other dogs like guess the maintenance man up here his dogs came and ran out to us and it was little labs and it was so cute and probably the most well-behaved dogs i've ever seen in my entire life it was such good dogs and then we just kind of hung out we played games we was like drinking all day my stomach doesn't hurt today which is good despite the fact that we ate ton of cheese and gnocchi but that fine um we played some video games think i'm excited to go back home just because then get to like take shower and stuff but i'm glad that did get to do these and have break from like the internet and all that shit even though was still kind of thinking about all of it like about guys and stuff it wasn't like it wasn't there and couldn't do anything about it which definitely helped so think maybe if if do these every once in while then it could be helpful little like restart thing and then the other thing is think the guys who go to [inaudible] so he leaving for spain tomorrow and think that'll be good for us just because then he'll be gone for little bit and he won't be able to talk we said that we'll keep like talking and keep snapchatting ca try to keep streak up so we'll do that and he was like yeah you and you're not [inaudible] only if you send us bunch of stuff so that that good um i'll just so that'll probably help us with that just doesn't know it kind of hard 'cause probably should just keep him off my mind especially if i'm starting to like these other guys who go to school in downtown boston especially if i'm like thinking that need to do something with the prince but doesn't really know but other than that there like little residual thoughts everything else was really good 
128,so today was fine it was just like normal day we got back from camping or whatever that was just going to my friend like cabin and it was really good to not have my phone for while immediately went on it but you know it okay and saw one of my friend for the last time before he goes back to school so that was nice to see him but also kinda sad it was kind of boring we just went to one place to take picture but that was it but you know that all that you really need um started the training for my new job thing so i'll probably finish that by sunday hope maybe saturday and hmm talked to the guy from [inaudible] and thought was getting over him but then we started talking more and he just like he does lot of cool thing too and we started then we was talking we was having like really good conversations about like being on the phone and like social media and getting excited from it and feeling like you always have to be caught up but then also having your self-worth be determined by it and think that not think know that that my whole problem but he was like so understanding about it ugh so hmm and there nothing can does about him either it just wait or ignore him and i'm not gonna ignore him so you know it whatever 
129,so today was nice and kind of boring day feel like say every single time didn't really do anything but today really didn't do anything woke up at like noon and um was doing that [inaudible] my training for my new job which has just taken me little bit of time it not that bad but um and then got haircut which is really making me feel myself 'cause that it really good haircut like my hair cutting lady wow she just she cut my hair really well it ridiculous and what else went out to dinner at the place where used to work so that was cool to see all of my old friends and uh what else what else um the other thing that happened was oh was playing the piano little bit and was talking to the guy from [redacted] again just talking more he like classical music too so there he literally has just become my perfect man which is very unfortunate and but was kind of like telling myself it okay you know just chill out it not that bad there nothing you can do about it and so was like trying to distract myself with random thing and kind of feel better but only sort of like know it i'm not really there like know i'm that i'm just ignoring it it not affecting me but it the problem hasn't gone away which mean won't be able to do anything about it so at this point that just all can do but just need to figure out how to really focus on other thing and think like once school starts then it won't be that big of problem because it just right now has nothing to do so that all can think about um i'm gonna try to has very minimal phone time usage tomorrow probably little bit when wake up do some snapchats but then just like leave it in different room for while for most of the day really wanna practice piano quite lot tomorrow and then also finish my training also need to run to my friends house so can get my water bottle since left it um 
130,today was normal day nothing exciting happened made dinner for my family which was kinda cool need to start learning how to cook [inaudible] made some made us some puttanesca sauce which was pretty good but it was one of my friend last day at home so we hung out tonight um yeah had good conversation about race with them which was actually like really good conversation partly because it was like listening or not being all defensive and shit like people usually are which was good um but what else was practicing piano lot more finished my training things have to talk to my manager but i'm not like super 100 certain on all of the stuff so will definitely need to go over it some more yeah i'm gonna do some stretching still little bombed about [top's] guy and with the other guy back in boston who will go out on date with he doesn't text us that much which uh definitely are things that irritates us so if anything go with them i'll talk to them about it 
131,so today wasn't really the best day um we went shopping and got some new gloves so that was cool but other than that really didn't do anything started black mirror which is kinda cool but also kind of just like don't really like watching tv i'm gonna be honest with you feel so unaccomplished when i'm done only like to do it if if i'm with somebody else um especially when i'm like bored 'cause when i'm bored want to do something productive but then when just fill my time with something unproductive then i'm like well now just feel like dumb well not dumb but just like feel like i've done absolutely nothing um the other thing that was gonna say oh yeah so um i'm just trying to feel more attached to this guy that actually lives in boston [inaudible] studying abroad still like him but really need to [inaudible] had to tone it down with him so like maybe tomorrow i'll snapchat him and keep my streak going but i'm not gonna text him unless he like text me first guess but don't even know if should do that think just really need to have like day or two again of it like don't really know what to do at this point 'cause it is that just wanna be in relationship just get so obsessive and don't know how to stop feel with during school it was lot easier because had thing to do and stuff was on my mind but then now that i'm back here and just have so much time that like don't know how to control myself don't know what to do and don't have like friends to hang out with here because they're all gone it already all left maybe i'll do some writing tomorrow that what i'll do just did little bit of reading but not lot maybe writing is gonna be my thing for the year or reading it was reading last year maybe it'll be writing this year 
132,today it was today was weird day so it started off fine kind of productive was eating taking shower and stuff and then did little bit of writing and had my conference call with my manager and that went really well so i'll start everything tomorrow um and let see what else watched all of season of black mirror which was fun played little bit of piano called the guy who i'm going out with on date with when get back called him and we talked for while and that was nice like talking to him but deleted all of my social media except for snapchat just because need definitely need cleanse so we'll see if delete snapchat don't know the whole thing is just with the [inaudible] guy is like i'm so hung up on him don't know how to take step back know have to but don't know well could just stop talking to him for while could say hey like you but i'm like in place right now where when talk to you every single day it just get hard for me so maybe should just stop for while or don't know say like hey can keep the snapchat streak up if you want but it will probably only be like one or two snapchat day just so can help myself might do that yes it bummer having to like say that guess i'm going to my old therapist tomorrow so i'll see what she say she might think that good idea or have another suggestion life is hard just decision-making is hard and the other thing that was thinking about is if end up dating this other guy how am going to like end it when [inaudible] guy [inaudible] guy comes 'cause don't think that th-this guy that i'm talking to right now definitely is the the guy that know wanna date for long time don't know yeah it just weird 'cause then i'd feel bad if like dated him knowing that no matter where he at i'm gonna wanna end it at the time at the beginning of fall semester so that just kind of douche move of me 
133,so today was um better than like yesterday guess went to my old therapist um for the first time since i've been back and that was really good she has kind of helped me um she just helped me like decide that i'm not really gonna wait for [redacted] i'll see him when he comes back but oh i'm not oops um the [redacted] guy but for the other guy who goes the other guy that gonna be in [redacted] goes out on date with him because it might be that don't even end up having relationship with him so just like that you're going to [fall] 'cause honestly he just isn't up on with the guy from [redacted] this isn't relationship where would expect that he would wait so shouldn't expect myself to wait mean know what i'm doing but it just like it just bummer that has to that has to settle with guess um just started my job um and i'm supposed to be taking clients now but there only like one clients and she don't match with my like personality or something so i'm not sure if i'm supposed to do that person or wait or don't know so we will we will see we'll see what happens 
134,so today was really really shitty day in general um didn't do anything basically just watched lot of tv did some reading and played little bit of the piano and did some work but it was just like checking up stuff and sending emails and shit but not anything actually like working working so hopefully i'll be able to like pick up clients soon hmph but i've just been like really sad and lonely today kind of back on my old shit where i'm like nobody like me and nobody wants to date me or anything nobody giving me the attention that wants so start to feel bad about myself but before it was like would make it into like self hate or something where would just be like oh i'm not attractive or something but it wasn't bad it was just like that residual feeling but it was only the residual feeling of like people don't i'm just it was just me being extra lonely guess and just feeling like nobody wanted to talk to me or hang out with me even though the people was like snapchatting me but it it wasn't satisfying and that the thing is that it never gonna be satisfying didn't go on my phone for solid four hours which when say it don't sound that impressive but mean it felt like really long time and the prince um has boyfriend now so let [leave it at that] am at this present moment don't get enough attention that wants from guy who actually living in [redacted] right now and the [redacted] guy is gone think today was his first day away and he opened my snap and didn't respond but he busy it don't really matter just kinda bummed about that ugh and then got like little stressed thinking about school and having to do schoolwork and working for my jobs and then also having like social life and trying to figure out when i'm doing all of this shit but we shall see we will see where it all plays out 
135,so today wasn't as bad as yesterday it wasn't necessarily bad day um kinda just did my normal thing ate food and um watched tv and played little bit of piano did little bit of reading was kind of bummed but kind of sad but not really more than any particular day think it was really just because i'm bored and lonely don't have anything to do and i'm kind of stressed about school but not really like i'm not stressed but then know i'm not stressed but when have nothing else to think about then my mind just like starts inventing stress which is irritating and like was feeling sad earlier for no apparent reason and [inaudible] the other day was just angry for no apparent reason or actually no there was reason it was because [redacted] he was just being kind of irritating lately where he just always talking about himself and then when try to talk about like one of my problems or something and then he just like don't engage at all or like he was he facetimed me he was saying how all of his friends is coming to him with his problems and he like have my own problems need to deal with and i'm like well you do see recognize the fact that these people have problems but it is still helping you with yours so it kind of like he just think that his is the most important which is frustrating um and it was especially frustrating today but from tomorrow only have one more week so that exciting 
136,so today was um guess it was as normal as any other day really was bored and lonely finished my book though which was nice that feel like actually got something done um and went to dinner with my family and we ordered bottle of wine and the server just poured me glass without id'ing me so that was pretty cool um but what else i'm going out to the mountain tomorrow don't really want to just because there gonna be nothing to do there there gonna be less things to do up there and my one friend who in here won't be there and it gonna be some tighter quarters than and he here so i'll definitely need to do something to like get out of the apartment bunch or else i'll go crazy um but it only for the long weekend which is good and hopefully i'll get like maybe some work done or something that get paired with somebody so saw these two people that wanna get paired with but it both requested female mentor and i'm gonna see if can like sneak my way through that 'cause i'm cool i'm one of the cool one 
137,so today was um it was normal day we came to the mountain and it it fine um was just doing like nothing the whole time um watched whole season of tv show and literally just stayed in the apartment the whole time it really really really boring um but the other thing that like really frustrating me is i'm trying to look at internship stuff and research stuff for next summer but all of [redacted] thing is so so inconvenient and so difficult to deal with it incredibly frustrating um but figured out that so requested to um be the mentor for this one girl who she was like into humanities and music and stuff but she requested female mentor but then my manager said you can still request her and we'll like see if she wants to work with you and stuff [inaudible] so we'll see if that work out 
138,so today was really really really boring again did nothing except for watch some tv do little walking eating read some of my book which was also nice that was good um but i'm so happy to be going back home tomorrow 'cause this has been one of the most boring vacations ever um and wish was back at school and um was looking for things to like research things to do in [redacted] over the summer could do something but it sucks because like for all the programs that give me money i'm not gonna be able to do them in the right hours so it really really sucks so there one that i'm gonna like email them and see hey you think you can scooch this little bit and then also get like meeting with somebody in the office of career services to help me figure out what can do um let see if can get anybody for working anywhere um yeah 'cause this is kind of stressful figuring lot of stuff out um what else i'm starting to get stressed out about money and like don't know how i'm going to be paying for all this stuff how i'm gonna be paying for college and shit 'cause let see probably has like 16000 that will need to pay in the end so will has to make don't know like to thousand dollars year for that save up for that um which would kind of sucks um um and then like on top of that getting money for everything else because think did the little searchy-search things and if for if work eight hours week on average for every week for this semester or fall semester plus what i'll be making for two mentor mentees plus my research things then i'll probably has 5000 at the end of the year which i'm gonna need more than that 'cause wanted to put 5000 away whatever we'll figure this shit out later 
139,so today was um was all right went to go see movie with my friend um it was really good movie it was we saw tonya it was so good it was such good movie and the acting was really good um did some reading i've been reading the this book called why i'm no longer talking to white people about race and it getting better the more read it so don't have much more to read think only have like 35 pages left so i'll finish it tomorrow um [redacted] guy started texting me again after he was ignoring me for don't know few days so but really should stop like wasting time with guy like that so maybe if after we go out on date and we like it should say something about that because i'm not about to just like sit here and stress out about guy not texting me don't wanna have to do that and i'm some adult now i'm mature so can deal with this can can handle this stuff the way that want and don't need anybody stressing me out 
140,today was okay hung out with one of my friends that hadn't seen in while but it was kinda weird because we had hooked up bunch in the past but tried to make move and he said no and of course respected that and was like okay totally good but then felt bad mean i'm sure everyone feels bad after that but at least was listening to him being like consensual that always good um finished my book did some online shopping watched movie with my parents which is it was all fine um nothing that exciting i've been on grinder and it been so frustrating just because then there would be guys who like talk to me and it get interested but then it just stop talking to me out of the blue which is extremely frustrating because just wanna meet up with someone before go and could just delete the app and be like you know what no but can't because have no self-control and uh it also feels like passing the time because i'm trying to think i'm [inaudible] hook up with this guys but there only three more days well now only two more days wednesday and thursday until have to go back um but then there this other kid he was in my one of my classes and he was senior in high school and he like is talking to me about all of his hookups and stuff and like how he think it gonna be so great and how everyone tells him that he gonna hook up with ton people when he get here and don't know it just really really annoying like he really immature about it and i'm talking to one of my friends and we've concluded that he definitely doing it just try to try to seem cool but it so frustrating just wanna say dude be quiet you're being annoying people don't talk like this but i'm just like whatever just ignore it 
141,so today was fine um went out to dinner with my parents for the last time um while we're here so it was nice and we had good food um and hung out with my friend and we had good time we watched westworld and went to his hot tub which was really it was just nice time also started new book i'm almost done with that it only like it non-fiction like collection of essays but it only 84 pages so really isn't that diff well it little it kind of difficult but it it just doesn't take that long um was feeling like generally oh also had to go get my passport my new passport which was really stressful for some reason um but other than that generally felt okay got to call the guy from boston so that was nice that we could talk um but everything else was normal guess was kind of little sad by the end of the day just because my one friend was telling me about computer science class he taking where he like logs all of the words in horror stories to try to see what words in what progressions like make writing scary got kind of like pissed just because was like well see how that like take lot of thought and stuff but it the wrong kind of thought when you're analyzing this kind of english because it not just like mechanical comparisons feel like they're they're the overall the overall parts that give you the feeling and like understand that that parts it could just search for them but then without the original analytic thought like the actual good stuff stuff that was true interpretation then you wouldn't even have basis for that and like to what extent is every single words giving that meaning there have to be so many different words that that give book feeling like that so doesn't know and then that triggered something weird but it was just me feeling lonely and that needed somebody to talk to but i'm back and and i'm about to go to sleep so feel better 
142,so today was my last full day at home and it was pretty uneventful day just did laundry finished my book watched some tv did some piano um you know it was kinda like [inaudible] day didn't talk to many people conversations weren't that long i'm really really didn't do anything 'cause it kind of slowly went by quickly feel like like in the moment felt like so bored like it was just moving so slowly but then now lying in bed i'm like this day went by really quickly am little sad that i'm leaving well i'm just sad that i'm leaving my family and stuff my bed am really excited to go back to school and hang out with all of my friends and not only to start my new classes but then like the ballet classes i'm really hoping that this will be transformative semester for me not just emotionally but also physically like with the classes hopefully that'll just make me more active and i'm don't think i'm biting off more than can chew right now think i'm just loading myself up with with stuff that it not particularly it like set amount of stuff per week so like with ballet that don't come home with work that don't come home with mentor that only like maybe max three hours week once have two mentees and have zero right now so that the only thing that i'm like not stressed guess i'm keeping it in the back of my mind and decided to apply to that inter one of the internships just because if get it then can decide if wanna fly home or not or can see if can modify the dates but if can't do any of that then i'll just decline that instead say something came up 
143,so i'm back at [redacted] and i'm so happy that i'm here got to see few of my friends which was really great um and the plane rides was okay was actually like really bummed because [redacted] again wasn't texting me like don't know why it was stressing me out so much and hope that now that i'm here it not gonna be that big of deal but think like with that the guy who who goes to school here if he 'cause he keeps ignoring me so if he don't change that we're seriously gonna have problem and it not to the point where it like me being crazy person where have to have him text me constantly it like he just opening multiple messages and not responding with like just don't know and it really frustrating know he like not ignoring or know that he not like mad at me or trying to ghost me or anything but it really frustrating when he does that so don't know we'll goes out [inaudible] date with him and see how it goes but if it gonna keeps being like this i'm just gonna say no 'cause i'm i'm not gonna put myself through that and so like was getting stressed out before and was like you know what i'm gonna talk to different guy right now because don't need to really make that big of deal out of this right now don't need that in my life 
144,had pretty good today day today um it was really fun got to see all my friends again it all came back so we all hung out and like went to dinner and went to breakfast and it was the women march today so that was like really good we didn't actually like march it was just rally but it was nice to go to that um it was really goo saw lot of friends and it was great to catch up with them all um and hooked up with this one dude and was like we was talking lot and we was having great convo it was great we started making out and stuff and then um like he finished but was hard before but then for some reason just lost it and don't know what happened and don't know i'm like feel like everybody gets slightly embarrassed and kind of am but also don't really care but als only sort of care because i'm like hope he don't feel weird about it hope he don't like feel like oh don't like them anymore because he couldn't gets hard or whatever but we was like hey you wanna go for little walk like it was 10-minute walk it wasn't anything um afterwards feel like we could do something after hookup then like definitely makes it not awkward because if that was kind of awkward mean it only awkward if you makes it awkward and so don't know we'll see if he texts me back well mean said had fun time thanks for going for walk and he was like did too and though i'm the walk was nice and then said good night so don't know we'll see if um if he texts me or i'll probably texts them again sometime later and be like hey you wanna just go gets some coffee do something tame and if things am looking up then sure it just weird don't like ending things on weird notes like that not saying that this is over but mean hope that it not over would like to go out to coffee with them some other time don't know feel kinda bad for like making them stay up later though just because he was like oh-- whenever we was finished he was like yeah have to gets up at 830 was like oh sorry did that so don't know i'll be like hey hope it wasn't too bad how about oh that smart how about buy you coffee to makes it up yeah smooth that what i'll do and if not then who care don't have to buy somebody coffee just no the one things is like gossip 'cause don't want that to gets out mean mean don't care mean do sort of care but really don't think it just things at the moment that kind of care it like kind of 
145,so had really really really great day today saw all my friends went out to family brunch and it was so great and then there was some other friends there too so we was there for like two hours just having fun and it was lot of fun and then saw one of my other friends in my entryway and we act like pi we played piano together and it was it was really nice and then worked on my cover letter so felt like was being productive and hung out with some more friends and we was all together and then we went to track meet to see one of my friends like don't know she was like sort of interested in him but it was kind of like weird but it was nice to just like do something with with people and then went and saw my other friends who just got back and we caught up and it was great and love her so much and then went out on like date with this dude where we went and we got dinner and we walked ar-around downtown lot and it was so much fun and then we went back to his apartment and we tried to watch movie but we was just talking the whole time we drank lot and we had lot of fun and he really fun guy and um and then he kissed he like came back to my dorm and he like kissed me goodnight which was so cute and it was great so don't know re-downloaded tinder because i'm dumb people because my friends matched with some dude that was really cute who had no idea was gay so then was trying to like trying to match with him too and still haven't [inaudible] and know need to delete it so at some point this week will delete it um but i'll see that guy again on thursday which will be really nice and he he he really cute he really funny and like him the only problem is that he lives far away and don't really have the funds to go out on like date with him all the time so the only problem with like dating somebody who don't go to [redacted] is can't just be like come over and chill with me or like watch movie or watch some tv or just like let go do homework together like can't really do that it not like the distance isn't really great for that so i'll like if things develop i'll have to talk to him about like what we're really gonna do because don't wanna have to spend money every single time we go out on date 
146,so today started off fine it started off as good day woke up at like 900 and took my time and took nice long shower and then went to breakfast then hang out with bunch of old friends then went to my first [inaudible] class and it was really cool but then um got then went to lunch and things started going downhill so my stomach started hurting managed to shove down all my food after like an hour but didn't even didn't finish all of it but it was like almost all gone so was like okay i'm just gonna just call it day and then um went back home and did like little bit of meditation which was nice went to work and worked 100 to 400 and actually had great time like talked to bunch of people [again] there this new dude that was kinda helping and was chatting with him lot and he was nice oh and he so gay too it so funny um but the um the good day at work was all just trick because the ballet registration came on while was at work and when got off and off of work and then went to go on to the registration page it was all full my class was already all full and the first people on the waiting list which means that like somebody just did uh don't even know how many people are registered it sucks like [inaudible] and then was just talking to bunch of people and started feeling bad then started feeling bad about my body and stuff just because like everybody else are working out and now my like one motivation to actually do it are gone um but i'm gonna go tomorrow morning and morning workout sucks but i'm just gonna have to do it so i'm gonna go to be like now was gonna go to bed earlier but then just took forever um and then was sad because that guy that had things with before but it ended badly um it didn't end badly but it just ended badly for me like was just kinda left in the dirt which really sucks and was just treated shitly and it wasn't fair for me and that kind of like what i've conclu-conclusion but anyways it was his surprise birthday party for me and all my friends was talking about it and was like damn this are just bringing back all of my bad memories and shit and like try to joke about it and be fun with it but it it it still sucks but this other guy that kinda like now means he really nice dude there are an things about him where i'm like that not my favorite well it just like an things that he talks about but really don't care it like it things where we we can actually have conver like good conversation about it but it not something where it like deal breaker it like we have the same thoughts about lot of stuff but then we differ on like little tiny things about this big things so it kind of good that can still have good discussion where we will have different opinions but that it won't be that bad but means he out with his friends right now and i'm alone and sad 
147,so today was like halfway good day halfway bad day started off good woke up early and worked out with my friend we went to like total body circuit and workout video not workout video workout class which felt really good after um and then had nice and easy time at work um let see what else else would be god the professor is looks to be irritating um but with african american lives in the law that class is gonna be really really really difficult but it'll be think it'll be really cool so i'm gonna take it um and let see what else um orchestra was good but by dinnertime started feeling like really really bad for some reason think it was just because like started thinking about that guy that we've been hanging out with more and we'd tried we both tried to call each other like three time but neither of us could pick up at at the time so it was weird because today we like texted lot more than usual but it still wasn't lot so it made us feel don't know kinda weird that just in comparison to the rest of the time that we're talking like it not very much so don't know if things keep going with him or i'll talk to him about it but think at this what i've been telling myself is to not talk about him with like friend or something because then just end up stressing out because just relive it every single time talk about it so i'm only talking about like guy with one friend so hopefully that'll be good um but then also worked out again went to the gym we was lifting with one of my other friend at like 900 and did not do much like homework and stuff but none of don't have anything due had reading due tomorrow and finished it but all the rest of my stuff is for tuesday or and then guess monday monday and tuesday so we'll see how everything goes 
148,so today was one of the worst days ever um woke up and went to woke up and re got two emails one from the seminar professor and she just said hi [redacted] thanks for the emails i'm glad you're [dropping] the class [redacted] and so that basically means nothing maybe either it means nothing or it that might uh say that my little thing no it probably just means that i'm not gonna get another class like that but the emails did nothing for my case then got another emails from the ls 1b people saying that cannot do the overlapping enrolment so then that means can't do african american [inaudible] so i'm going to instead take an afam literature class tomorrow morning and also realized have to do ps11 to do orgo so can't do orgo next year so i'll have to wait until junior year do that which in not ret what what the opposite of retrospect futurespect don't know and looking ahead that might be better for my case just not really knowing if wanna do med school so i'm kind of like really evening out all of my requirements throughout all four year so then that way would be applying either for gap year or have two gap year and do job which that might be nice that would actually probably be preferred um but let see what else um um went to the circadian rhythm class which was good but now i'm just thinking like what do do with all of these class and lecture means discussion how do fit them all in so that can also work so that really stressing me out is finding time to do all that shit have to do these all by friday and don't really know what to do so i'm really kinda stressing out by really means super stressing out and then they're like oh you have to do these thing to sign up for section by friday but we can't do that yet for ls 1b so have to talk to my friends to see how to do that but you know everything is not going well and on top of that the guy that like he have barely talked to me today and is it so hard why is that so hard don't understand it really just don't know what to do and i'm don't want to vent to my friends because don't want to be annoying about it and constantly harp on the same thing over and over again but then just like ruminate on but i'm ruminating on it no matter what it just so frustrating 
149,so uh today was also shitty day probably shittier than yesterday so for this past week the thing that i've been looking forward to was that was going to hang out with the guy that went out with last sunday and was probably going to spend the night but wake up to text of him saying that he can't do it because one of his friends from new hampshire is gonna come to town so that means that can't hang out with him and this is the second time that he has canceled and on top of that he still sucks at replying to me so all of my friends has told me to cut him out and think will just do not know why has guy even come to me acting like he want to be in relationship and then he treat me like shit like do just has something about me that says treat me like shit fuck with me is that really what people see that he that that is okay that that what want him to do but re-downloaded tinder and that helped boost my ego and went to the seminar that wanna get into there was like 40 people that shopped it and only is gonna be let in and this one annoying girl was kissing ass so she probably is gonna get in even though she doesn't really deserve it so great this is just great 
150,so had really great night tonight my friends fro my friends from home who goes to [inaudible] um came to visit and we had like really great night we went out we didn't actually goes to any parties but we like [inaudible] with bunch of friends and we had like really really fun time and actually like met some new friends and almost hooked up with this one dude like it was close to establishing but it didn't happen but that was okay had really fun time and registered for classes so it good that like that shit is all figured out um and went to see therapist today so i'm still bummed about the guy who kinda went out before and it might be that he just like really busy but you know don't care i'm talking to other guy and it fun to talk to other guy so mean right now i'm feeling really good and sleep well it like [inaudible] but you know whatever so yeah 
151,so today had like an amazing day woke up and was super happy and went to this like public service conference and was like feeling so good just about like that what wanna do wanna do something where i'm like with people in public service or do like legal service or something or even like public health um and it also made me realize that don't wanna be premed anymore so finally just pulled the trigger and dropped ls 1b i'm taking pol political theory class instead and my life already feels so much better like none of my friends think of me as premed it only they're like you it notice that hate all my premed class and that don't enjoy them and that i'm am trying to skirt around taking them all so it like like the idea of being doctor and like learning science but don't wanna actually like do the intro bio or do chemistry or do physics or even do like calculus anymore don't don't wanna do that so just i'm i'm done and feels like this is good like it good change for me and don't know i'm kinda lonely right now i'm kinda lonely wish that have like somebody that could could be in relationship with but there nothing can really do about that mean could be interested in somebody but can't actually force anybody to be in relationship with me so there that but it okay 
152,um today was it was like only work it was only doing homework just because had to catch up with the reading for my um political theory class and the reading are hard but um it it wasn't that bad like had lot was reading all day but um it was manageable so that good that that was like week worth of stuff for only one weekend um but i'm going to definitely be way more productive this semester so know have um some reading that due thursday um have four nights for it so i'm gonna get going maybe even do some reading tomorrow morning when i'm at breakfast my main thing that i'm like having trouble with are like with the dude he are in my entryway where are pretty sure where he like straight but also have no idea we was talk 'cause there are so many signs especially today so like knew that he was going to that he was having his um tracked meet so said um said to him like good luck on your track meet um unless you're still injured and you can't run then get better soon and so he did the the heart react on the good luck on the track meet and then he said thanks baby so was like hmm that little gay so what the truth and then later we um was talking can't remember there was something else that happened and then was talking to him went to get some sushi with my friends tonight and talked to him and was like yeah it sushi place and he was like oh i've never been there we should go some time and was like hmm okay gay so don't know if he just like extremely friendly and he like one-on-one hanging out with me and just calls like all of his other straight friends baby and like heart-reacts him and stuff but also have no idea and don't know what to do about that situation and with the guy that was talking to who lives he lives in [redacted] he um go to school downtown um uh um so he had been like basically ignoring me since thursday and then all of sudden tonight he and he came to [redacted] too and he didn't like text me or anything um and oh that the thing are told told my my the the air quote straight guy and he was like he don't deserve you and having your fun and loving energy and was like hmm okay but um then he called me and he was talking and was like yeah sorry just had like really busy weekend and so understand that and know that he talking to me again but also he if he wants to pursue something then he needs to actually put effort into it and i'm not gonna be going through this every single weekend he going out with friends like don't wants somebody who one cancels on me all the time and then two don't text me or even if he comes to [redacted] he don't even say oh hey i'm in [redacted] don't have any time to meet up but was just thinking about you don't know something random like that don't understand how that so hard so really [inaudible] talking later if thing continue like that um but also wants to pursue this other guy and like see where it go 
153,so today was um it it was weird day started off with my gov class and it was great lecture really um think i'm gonna really like that class it difficult but it not like it um mentally it it gonna be challenging class to like grasp and kind of understand like the professor was super great but think like the content just needs your own deep thinking and understanding which is gonna be something cool that but something that definitely needs to work on um but with my fam it weird because there guy that from the very beginning of the semester the fall semester that had falling out with and was i'm actually like uncomfortable in in class with him so i'm gonna talk to my advisor about that and be like yo what do we do because was thinking about it and he was so manipulative that it was borderline sexual harassment and didn't realize how much on top of him just being racist and problematic and didn't kind of really realize how big of deal it was um but had great day at work sitting there for four hours had like had stuff to do but also had time to do some reading which was really helpful and then went to the gym and went to my entryway meeting where we had sushi and pizza which was nice and then did some more homework with the guy who lives next door to me who i'm like aware he straight but also at the same time like don't think he is and there was few things and i'm definitely overthinking this but it just like triggered some thought so the first things texted him and was like yo wanna do homework together and like he was like yeah said your room and he was like yeah but wait like little bit because this other people is here in the room right now and like yeah okay but then was like if i'm friends with him too 'cause it was also people in my entryway so i'm like why wouldn't he just say come over now we can all hang out like he just wants me to be be there with him alone so i'm like hmm what going on but he just wanted to be alone and then when there we're there and talking and stuff and we was talking but we was also doing homework so we was being productive and then we started like watching some youtube videos together which was kind of fun um but then as when first got there he put his hand on my shoulder and was like hey and was like hey but then when left put my hand on his shoulder and then he put his hand on my hand he said good night sweet prince and then like made some little comment about him like that was like don't know just leave it at that and like don't know it weird so i'm gonna talk to my advisor about that and then i'm also gonna talk to my proctor about that 'cause don't know what he think should do 'cause he also gay so like don't know maybe he'll say to shoot my shot 
154,so today was an okay day it wasn't like that great or that bad um nothing really happened went to work it was pretty chill which was nice um didn't stay long only for three hours but i'll probably stay for four hours from here on out and then orchestra which was chill then went to dinner with my advisor and that was great it was really good to catch up and talk to him just about like life and stuff and it nice that can have him as boss but then also as like real person that can talk to about real things like we was talking about relationships and stuff and just like summer plans and emotional things yeah don't know it was good um but then talked to the guy who goes to school downtown and we're planning on hanging out thursday night but he was doing this weird things where he was telling me about this dude that he used to have like an sort of relationships with last year because it like met up again and he was saying that he realized that he didn't like him at all anymore but still it was weird just kind of talking about it together 'cause it it was it was just like him talking and me kind of listening 'cause that was kind of uncomfortable but don't know so don't know if really wanna pursue something with him just because of the way that he like he kind of just the way that we talk just in general 'cause it don't seem like we keep in contact very much and like the conversations are only good when we call each other on the phone which can't do that all the time just because have to work and shit um but submitted my application for my internship um didn't finish one of my readings but meh that okay i'll finish it before section tomorrow um don't know the guy next door to me don't don't know what to do about him i'll probably ask him if he wants to like watch movie this weekend or something don't know everything are weird 
155,today was good day guess went to class and class was fine nothing too exciting about it um went was was mean was having good time with with my friends went to breakfast with the guy who lives next door to me and talked to my proctor about what should do and he was like you know what if you want to if you have like the courage to ask him and stuff like that then would and then he was like then just do it and was like you know what and we we have like really good conversation um and he was like yeah wouldn't worry about anything with him just being next door like just see what happens so like we did homework together today um and there was couple time when we got like kinda close to each other like there was there was couple time when could've put my head on his shoulder but didn't um so it was like don't really know what to do right now so we we said that we was gonna watch movie some time this week or this weekend so i'll see if that when something will happens um don't know will be like hey can put my head on your shoulder or just like do it and then see what he do but i'll ask one of my friends to see what his opinion is um but dunno try not to get attached so can feel myself sort of backing away which is good um 'cause there also that dude that lives like in downtown boston so i'm hanging out with him tomorrow and that he and we'll see what happens there 
156,so today was was like oh it started off as great day went to my lecture no not my lecture my seminar we had like an amazing conversation so good can tell that i'm gonna love that class and then went and had lunch with an friends it was really nice and then went to gov 10 section and god it was problematic as fuck because they're so like dumbass white boys there who who really are just privileged assholes so these are really where that people come out like there was these one dude he was freaking out because of like an answer it gave was like bro don't know anything about gov just chill out like the tf even like it had to change the subject it was like uh why are he getting so heated it not that deep not that big of deal anyways and then went to coffee with one of my friends which was really nice to catch up with her and was supposed to go to the guy who lives downtown was supposed to go to his apartment tonight but he didn't text me back so guess i'm i'm just done i'm not even gonna deal with him anymore if he text me again i'll say i'm sorry but these are not gonna work out if you continue to treat me these way because don't appreciate it and that not what i'm looking for um but like i'm not gonna make you change to be somebody who you're not so i'm not gonna say sorry about it because really don't need that in my lives right now that it kinda stressing me out and really don't need told myself we don't want that so that done no more will be strong and when he does text me because he probably will then i'm just going to say no like i'm an afterthought feel like an afterthought and at these point it going to be hard for you to change that but with the guy next door to me hung out with him again tonight he really fun don't know what to does these weekend i'd like to make move or something see if we go out to party or hang out saturday night does something don't know um but right now i'm feeling kind of sad just because of well also rushed that frat who dumb the more that think about it it was just dumb and kind of boring spilled drink like like right when got in was like oops also the house was really ugly i'm not about to rush frat where it like split-level [inaudible] no that disgusting i'm not doing that go to [redacted] for christ sake if i'm gonna be part of social group if i'm gonna spend money on social group it better have goddamn house that nice so yeah we'll just wait maybe i'll get pre-punched which that would be pretty cool uh yeah so hopefully when wake up tomorrow things won't be as sad as are right now 
157,so just had my um like orchestra [board] initiation thing couple of hours ago i'm the new social chair of my orchestra which is like oh pretty cool i'm super excited about that so that gonna be like lot of fun and what about today today um so figured out basically only have to do two readings each day this weekend and then i'll be done and ready so that really good so i'm like happy about that that don't have to do that much um what else so started that did my two went to the gym went to the women basketball tea game and got free fanny pack then also went to the track meet for little bit to go see my neighbor who also the dude that like and although he injured and so he not actually running just like wanted to go like see him and still cheer on the team so think he appreciated that um yeah like him so at some point soon i'll probably just be like hey let go out on date or hey what going on with you you game because the way that he acts around me he don't acts around that or like that around his other straight friends and that what saw when we were at the track meet so that were like positive for me and then also he were like acting differently around me not necessarily like in negative way but he just wasn't acting in as like flirty and touchy way as he usually do so i'm like hmm he could be trying to hide it from his dude friends so that is also sign that he could just be like little closeted or something which mean that is good for me because like him so hopefully this weekend i'll get to the bottom of it 
158,so today was really really weird day just woke up it wasn't like was hung over anything or didn't feel sick it just felt like really weird and like uncomfortable and kind of confused the whole day was really out of it and was super confused and couldn't focus at all and everything was like sensory overload like went out to dinner with one of my family friends and one of my friends came with me and was like oh my god i'm so overwhelmed right now and she like it chill it not that bad so was just like everything was lot for me today um but was happy because got all my reading done that was that got planned that had planned for plus little bit extra so then tomorrow the only thing that have to do for work is just read 10 pages um which will be good and went to lunch with dude again today and then he asked me to go to dinner with him but then was at dinner with my family friends so couldn't but then so think we're gonna get brunch tomorrow which will be fun um and we'll see about dinner but that like feel like it good sign that he asking me to meals multiple times in the same day like then if we go uh once every day it not like anything like weird or anything don't know feel like it that good sign um so yeah at some point maybe tomorrow night if we like end up watching movie or something i'll see if like we end up cuddling or anything and then afterwards could ask him don't know if should ask him in person or if should text him it 'cause it could be kind of weird situation don't know i'll i'll ask one of my friends 
159,today was pretty normal day um woke up and got brunch with um my neighbor dude again and it was good but then he does this weird stuff so tell everybody about how we're flirting and stuff and give them examples and they're like yeah he like you but then today he told me the story of how he made out with girl so then last night so i'm like what are you doing i'm like are he bi don't know th even if he are then maybe he just thinks of me as friend but then why are he acting differently around me than he does to his other friend but don't know so um decided i'm just gonna ask them like what up be like hey never really had good straight friend before so don't know if i'm just like misreading things but what up so i'll probably send that tomorrow um and then just like make it not be awkward it like yo bro i'm just confused um it may be like he chill enough to like understand not does like whole like you blah blah blah blah blah to make it weird and just be like i'm reading signs and i'm kind of confused um but did lot of homework today but not like watched some tv too and um went and watched the super bowl with my friend so that was good except some of my friend are having like little drama between them and it kind of stressing me out because don't know how it gonna affect his housing group and not many people are like talk communicating well so i'm not entirely sure what going on and like none of if really affect me or are because of me just are nervous for like the dynamic of the blocking group like don't know how that gonna work out um but yeah so with my homework got the majority of my stuff done that due on thursday even so i'm chiling 
160,so today was really really really really really long day started with class 10 to 1200 then worked 100 to 500 then had like little break but then had um section 700 to 800 and then like an [inaudible] meeting thingy 830 to 930 well it was more like 950 and had like study break so went to go get like an churros or whatever for little bit but then was working until like midnight so didn't really stop moving all day um and got into my ballet class so that starts on thursdays so i'm super excited about that um but lately i've just been feeling weird because i've been feeling more socially awkward just like more stressed out when i'm around people and like don't know how to talk to people like i'm having harder time like picking up um social cues and stuff like that which is not great and also the guy that go to [redacted] downtown he texted me again and he was like hey i'm back so sent him long text that was like this isn't gonna work out blah blah blah blah blah know you've been on your phone so you didn't even like give me the time of day the give me quick message saying 'i'm not gonna be on my phone' you've done this multiple time thought could look past but it really not something that wanna put myself through or even slightly go through the stress of this isn't just it just isn't gonna work out and he hasn't responded and but he still posted on sapchat story so guess that his way of just like saying bye also just in an immature way so don't really understand people but you know that okay and then i'm still trying to figure out what to do with the guy who lives next door to me but think we're going out to dinner on friday then he was like do you have anybody you wanna bring was like no like do you and he was like no so don't know he just like thinking this is friends or what don't know 
161,so today was normal tuesday um didn't have class which was nice it was just work 900 to 100 which like while i'm there well it sucks that have to wake up early but it uh good for me that i'm like actually getting work done being productive because then if just sleep then i'm not actually gonna like be up and ready to go until at least 100 at least noon which i'm like that how it is but with work except i'm actually getting some homework done then at that time so it like good for my productivity which meant that got all of my homework done except for how many readings think well okay so one for [inaudible] that it just like short article so really i'm just not in the mood to read it if wanna read it can do it for section but if not then it we'll just go over it in lecture and then also had two mcb like study things to read except because i'm not giving presentation on it really don't need to um to like read that but might later like if have extra time um the only things i'm still kind of thinking about dude next door but i'm trying to do it less and like stress less um but also noticed that i've like been getting back to talking to bunch of guys so like went to coffee with one and then was kind of like flirting with another we ended up um like sexting which i'm really not proud of myself about like was just really horny and so now regret doing it so really need to like control myself and stop myself from doing that mean have like so have plans to spend the night with somebody on thursday night and then breakfast plans friday and then coffee date friday afternoon and then i'm going out to dinner with my neighbor guys tomorrow night mean friday night and then saturday have brunch and i'm going out with another dude so it like one one two three four five guys within 48-hour period which probably isn't the best so think should cut back don't know if wanna do the sleepover things we'll see maybe should just like delete my grindr that probably good idea 
162,so today was like really really busy day um had class 1000 to 1200 and then class 300 to 500 um that was lot of class and then two of my friends who was in my 300 no 200 200 to 500 two of my friends that are in that class didn't go so was just going by myself so was like alone and it was really confusing so i'll definitely have to like go over the lecture notes and stuff again maybe go into office hours and ask some questions um but other than that was just like mostly lonely today and was kind of thinking like even though have all these guys that i'm talking to none of them really matter and it feels like i'm just piling things up and uh i'm just like piling all these guys up but none of them really mean anything and like know i'm not going to pursue any of these people don't know if it do want to either but are like unavailable like my neighbor or they're just busy like these other dude who go to law school or something like that or [redacted] boy who abroad so that sucks 
163,so today uh started off kind of as bad day was feeling sad and shit and don't know really know why just kind of lonely normal me issues not really knowing like exactly what wanna do just feeling dumb kind of in general compared to other people and like kind of thinking about my work ethic and maybe how can just start working harder just like reviewing notes and study and shit more feel like that would be just helpful like maybe going through my gov notes and like highlighting important shit and like adding additional notes don't know something like that anyways well um had my first ballet class today and it was so great i'm so happy that i'm in that it definitely gonna be the best part of my semester it just gonna be so nice i'm so glad that that how get to end my week because remember how it was going and was stressed and was tired but got there and was like yes had lot of fun and it was good workout but that just means because it only once week i've gotta go to the bar like at least every three day which that kind of sucks but you know what we'll do it um and went to hook up with guy tonight but we just like watched some tv and talked we drank some wine and we made out but was like we're not having sex and so we didn't and yeah as was about to leave he like tried to pull me back in and almost like pushed me down on the bed but was like hmm nope said that said hmm nope and then was like time for me to go so there that hopefully my dinner tonight will be means tomorrow night will be really fun i'm hoping it will be think it'll go well 
164,don't really know it the thing about today so like got work done and it was good then went on errands then got my la slippers which was good but was glad to go get that shit was actually really productive with my reading like finished all my af am stuff and almost all of my well not almost almost one of half of one of my gov 10 reading so can conceivably get all of the gov stuff done tomorrow and then would just have my seminar stuff on sunday which would be nice but i'm going out to lunch tomorrow with dude to eat out and i'm going out with my friends from [inaudible] really have that much time then today went out to dinner with my neighbor too and it was good but then afterwards we went back and we was hanging out and then his friends came and then we started talking about this other girl that he like trying to hook up with so then i'm like well then he either straight or he just like not interested in me so guess that over which mean kinda needed to expect it kinda sort of did like i'm not distraught but i'm bummed like i'm sad and feel like that valid thing to have but now the other thing that was like sad about will be in relationship and know it like dumb to ask that right now but it feel like can't even be in one is not even serious relationship like none of this stuff actually work it just like me trying to date somebody and somebody not being interested in me 
165,so just got home from going out told myself go to bed early tonight [redacted] it'll be good but instead went out with my friends and had fun but there was the guy who like had thing with at last semester that ended around halloween and he dating somebody now so that sucks for me 'cause he was like oh don't wanna date anybody and now he dating somebody and liked him which makes me feel like shit and on top of that the other guy at the very beginning of the semester who actually harassed me was also there so that wasn't funny there so if looked to the right there was the two guy dating making out if looked to my left there was the the harasser dancing on some other dude and was trapped in the middle and didn't wanna tell my friends that wanted to leave because he was having fun which sucks and i'm crying it okay but did lot of work today so that was good 
166,so started the day by waking up and my neighbor friend came over and we talked about like both of my nights and how both of my nights were really kind of shitty and mean it were good conversation it were nice to have and then went to brunch with my friend and we also all talked about how last nights were shitty and um asked my neighbor just like if he were bi and he said no but nothing have changed so far with the friendship like he still he acting the exact same way and even like nicer today especially um which is good but it also good that he just have like closure now but um feel really sick so woke up and thought had pneumonia or something but it just an upper respiratory infection because went to urgent care today and got checked out so that were good um just need to go in to work tomorrow and steal an ibuprofen an advil or whatever that fucking shit is um and did an reading but basically spent the whole day in my bed um but also i've think with everything that happened last nights were so shook just wanted like guy attention so then obviously went on every like dating thing that have and obviously nobody really is texting me or messaging me back so then that just made me feel terrible too so really last nights were terrible today have also been pretty shitty just with like my physical health but then also my mental state but i'm just ready to go to bed and get today over with 
167,so um woke up today was feeling little bit better which was good um but then went to class and started feeling shitty again so didn't go to work um but just did lot of homework so was extremely productive today but was still feeling so sick but then by the end of the day then was feeling better um and let see because got all my [inaudible] readings done read 50 pages of my book and then read 50 pages of another of other readings well yeah 50 pages and then oh no not 50 40 45 pages still and then did an outline for my [inaudible] essay so that good um but we also went to this like bsa relationship meeting which is when like the black community comes together and talks about relationship and it started off like okay but then it got like really problematic where people was where it was super heteronormative and then people was just saying oh like here everything wrong with bmf but you're not really giving us any real um solutions and we're like the there is not just there is an simple things that you can do but like there is big difficult structural things that you need to change which is not something it just like being self-aware it it simple in that fact but hard in implementing and it something that not gonna fix overnight so it it was just getting stressful but um it was fine and then went and did homework with my friend um but also realized um am not excusing like white people anymore for not being attracted to us just because like it really is just racist and unacceptable so somebody is like uh like there was this one dude who was talking to like flirting with an other dude at party where thought one of them was cute and another one was just like not cute like he was this lanky boy with gigantic nose and no lips and shit like that and he was just like ugly and he yeah the dude didn't talks to us at all so it fine no it not fine it not fine and was like don't yeah so there was things that was telling my friend about but it don't really matter right now because i'm over it 
168,so today was um was good day compared to like yesterday and especially on sunday because got um lunch with one of my upperclassmen friends and we had like super good conversation about just like being part of the black community and stuff about like um don't know beauty standards and just relationships in general and um just like living here and being in this weird social space where like feel even in the black community it even weirder where everybody is like competing to be to to see who has most clout like it really is competition and um but then we and then also just like stuff with that with the two guys that saw at the party you know on saturday um but it was really good it was like great conversation and then it wasn't like just me talking it was also her talking to me about like some of the stuff that she was going through and i'm glad that like one i'm glad that she felt like she could tell me and two i'm glad that wasn't dominating the space 'cause that one thing that like worry so much about um and then we like had really good conversation but then it ended up being like funny one in the end where some other people joined in and we was just chilling and hanging out which was great um and then had orchestra and orchestra was super fun and did lot of work got all my reading done for tomorrow and then also for thursday and wrote um paragraph for my essay probably has to cut it down little bit but you know that okay we'll figure it out so it was productive day but also like really chill and easy one like did work homework when was at work and then only after like 800 pm which was like really nice that didn't has to deal with well mean it would has been wou-would has done homework earlier but was hanging out people so it was nice that got to has that time 
169,so today was valentine day and was actually kind of excited because did thing here called data match where it like bunch of cs people got together and like made some sort of matchmaking thing and um naturally everybody match was people who was ugly but nobody who matched with me reached out to me but you know that okay don't really care um it was really nice day out so was outside it was and with friends was having really good time but then the rest of it was just like so bored and kinda sad and mean it valentine day so naturally every single people is sad not every single people but every people who is single is sad and it wasn't that was just sad it was just well mean was little sad just from talking to what my friends about like racism and within the gay community and like white gay not liking me so which is the primary people in the gay population here so it kinda bummer it and i'm telling myself that i'm going on man cleanse know it not gonna work but like emotionally i'm gonna say like no more hooking up with people um yeah just stuff like that because don't wanna have to be emotionally attached to anything right now like really do need to give myself break and like convince myself not not that not that it need to be like tricking convince but just need to teach myself that yeah do actually need break 
170,so today was normal thursday i'm kind of busy but feel like have lot of things to do but they're spaced weirdly so figured out though okay no let start at the beginning my seminar that had today was great like always um then after that had lunch with some friends and then did some homework finished rough draft of my one of my papers that due um my [inaudible] papers that due on next wednesday so finished that and then finished the rough draft and then went to go attend the section and talked lot today um but it was really was getting nervous lot when was about to say something like my heart rate started going up and it was really weird um and then just like did nothing for 30 minutes and then went and ate dinner at 430 gross but also got some food to take home so then at 500 went to my intro to [inaudible] um dis-discussion and talked but didn't talk like ton didn't dominate the conversation at all but did pipe in uh couple of times and apparently well one girl was like she one girl like me said something and she was like wow that was good was like pfft thank you um 'cause whipped out some chip from another class and then had ballet and that was great it was really hard workout today we did lot of stuff and my brain is fried and forgot all of it and so that gonna be some issue and what else oh came home and finished the rough draft of my papers did my laundry finally and uh sent out some email for the um for the movie night that i'm having with my orchestra and that took while it was just dumb dumb reason why it took while um but it was funny um the only things that i've been thinking of that i'm still okay so know need to take break from men though i'm not going to like go out on dates with guy or like hook up with any guy definitely i'm not hooking up with any guy for don't know just say try feel like it shouldn't be hard to do for month of not hooking up with guy because think after while that also it like i'm training myself to not need it which is feel like is good and can still like hang out with some people but i'm not gonna like i'm going to say that um this is just as friends because don't need anything like that in my life right now don't wanna have to like think about it and stress out about it and think that might be the best for me 
171,so today was um it was fine day nothing really happened woke up no went to the doctor and [my] therapist which was nice guess and went to the only thing is if like question is therapy even like helping me at this point don't know it just weird like nothing really seems to be changing so don't know like how to do that but anyways so went to office hours and figured out what i'm gonna do for my final project for my one class and um did some homework and went to see black panther which was super fun then went out with some friends um really don't think my friends wanna have like kick back tomorrow which mean might but also part of me just really wants to go to bed so like really wants to just sleep lot so don't know if that what gonna happen and also have to go work at like debate tournament tomorrow which don't really wanna do but i'm doing it though kind of just gonna go for it 
172,so today was pretty boring and uneventful day just woke early to um go to the debate tournament and um that was fine got lot of work done made 50 bucks which was quite sweet um that took like the whole day so really nothing happened and then got back and my friends was like let all go out and have kickback so we had we drank little bit and we went to the basketball game and then after that we went to [redacted] then came home so it was very uneventful day nothing really happened um feel like couldn't even didn't really have any stimuli anything had no stimuli sorry wasn't really like fuming [inaudible] certain way which is good um my acne coming back though which that sucks and i'm little dis physically uncomfortable i'm kind of sore my body is really sore really wish that could go just go away but [inaudible] it doesn't seem to happen which is unfortunate 
174,so um last night ended up hooking up with guy which is why didn't do the audio thing last night guess just forgot to do that one um but like it wasn't bad or anything had fun but just kind of realized am done with hookups don't really like them they're not that fun the only time that they're ever really fun is with somebody that i'm actually like interested in and then it not hookups it would be like we went out and something might happen it not like one-time thing well hopefully it won't be one-time thing so maybe i'm just gonna cool it with that for while um but have all my essays done the only thing is that i'm like writing them and i'm thinking about them and i'm like don't feel smart with these essays like feel like i'm just regurgitating thing i'm not thinking of anything really deep and that yeah can get something written down on paper relatively quickly it just not very good which sucks and like don't know didn't really have much time to to go to office hours mean did have time just didn't do it so maybe the next essays that we have i'm just gonna go to office hours and like run ideas by them to see what like tfs think and like if somebody could lead in the dire right direction because don't wanna be too basic with my stuff um and then basically just did like lot of reading today read like 80 pages of my book and finished my one paper so then all have to do and also did my psat so the only thing that have to do left is make an outline for my novella that i'm doing do my two gov reading edit and turn in that paper send in questions for gov do little questions [inaudible] [post] thing for for lit and that it so not that much but um like big list but each one is kind of small except for finishing the book but that like 34 more pages or something 32 more pages so it not terrible but something that i'm definitely gonna have to like do 
175,haven't been this tired in so so long and it not just like physically tired i'm also just so mentally tired from this past weekend like i've done so much i've read two books i've written two essays judged debate tournament i've done extra reading for other classes i've had to go to office hours to do shit and i've been hanging out with friends and been doing work like today at work it was actually had like lot to do and didn't have much time to actually do my own homework which kind of sucked and was really hoping to have that time and then after that was reading and editing my paper submitted my paper so that good and finished my books but then had to go to orchestra so it was big thing and then went to go hang out with friends and we went to this event that was from 700 to like 900 and then we ate some food so didn't get back home until like 945 and then did some reading and had to go print out thing but saw some friends so obviously was like moving slowly oh my god and finished my books and finished my well almost finished my reading still have like one and half reading to do for classes at 1000 but we're not gonna be discussing it so really it just gonna be for section on thursday just have to do that and write some questions for section tomorrow and then make like short little proposal outline thing of my novella that want to write don't wanna do that so th-those are both due tomorrow mean that are both due thursday so and don't wanna go to my lecture don't wanna go to any of my lecture tomorrow but i'm going to have to which sucks which sucks 
176,so uh today was don't know it was been really weird day it really nice out so that was fun but found out today that one of my friends from high school um committed suicide yesterday so that been really hard um think mean it it like so sad but it it another thing to have it be somebody who you was friends with and who you go off to college and you know that and knew that wasn't gonna see him again but it weird to think that now can't see him again even if wanted to and don't know feel like this is just kind of move towards being an adult because th people just like leave and you're kind of like that that just what happens it not like you're expected to deal with it yourself but you're like expected to understand that that just gonna happens mean like as kid you know that people die but very few kid actually like have it happens to him guess not like it die but witness or not witness but even have somebody in their life die somebody who who not just like great-grandpa or something or even yeah don't know with family members what it like 'cause at least with him like was would see him all the time yeah and just on top of that there is the normal feelings of uh don't know how to write and that feel like there isn't anything that i'm good at here like my friends was editing my paper for class and she was like yeah your analysis and res really analysis is just kind of summary i'm like shit shit shit shit that that sucks uh and don't even have like can't analyze thing don't know how to do that apparently and i'm just like stressed and the stress is making [me] acne worse don't know everything hard 
177,so didn't go to class today or went to class in the my first class at 1030 it 1030 to like 1145 'cause we got there late and we got out early it really kind of weird but didn't go in to my other sections just because was like feeling really bad about my friend and then also just like about just my life in general feel ugly and feel dumb compared to my friend don't know just feel weird like i'm awkward that can't make friend or like say the right thing and that like just keep regretting everything that say like i'm like oh so weird like my social anxiety is just getting worse and worse but went to ballet which was really nice that was good and fun but like because didn't go to class and just had me day so went to watched some tv went to the art museum and did little bit of uh um reading for class and then also some reading for myself um actually it was really nice to be able to do that and um yeah just and then also listened to speech for class tonight so got like work done but then also had me time was supposed to hang out with my friend but then he didn't text me back so don't know more it just weird rough cold day 
178,so today was weird day it was like halfway stressful halfway not stressful um woke up at reasonable hour was feeling good um and did some reading and went to lunch and was like yes but then had the realization that my essay that due on wednesday i've been doing it all wrong um and so needed to redo that entire essay and then also on march 7th have have two in-class midterms one take-home midterms that due and then some essay that due that day so getting really stressed out about that too um and then also that thursday housing day and have like 10-page prologue thing for my novella that is due so have lot of writing to do and lot of studying to do on top of that still have reading for my other classes so that really kind of sucks and then also so nee just need to calm down and not be stressed because also my gums is getting swollen from the from my wisdom teeth so that not good need some ibuprofen but don't have any we're fine we're good it'll go down by itself but did go shopping and got myself some shorts which um am happy about but edited my paper got all of my af am reading done and made some outline for my paper that due march 7th so i'm making good headway the only thing for sure that i'm gonna do is do my gov reading all my gov reading i'm gonna read 100 pages of my book for um my lit seminar maybe 150 that would be nice if could do that um and then um what else and then get five pages done for the prologue by wednesday we're gonna say by wednesday by thursday morning i'll have five pages of the prologue done so that'll be have th 1000 1000 words about maybe like 1500 words so think we're good think that solid goal gonna be busy but i'll get through it 
179,so today was like mix between fun day and stressful day um started off doing some work only like little bit got my essay edited and like went back and think it edited to point where unless have like major things to do like just my thesis isn't just have some incorrect thesis then should be fine um but then also hung out with one of my friends he in like the naval academy so um met up with him and he this other gay dude and he was cute but again i'm taking break from men so um we like didn't do anything obviously also we only had one day but um and then my other friends [redacted] came oh i'm just kidding that not his name but my other friends who goes to [redacted] came and he we just went like thrift shopping and stuff which was fun um but then was really kind of stressed out about work even though that don't have that much it like due on monday or even on wednesday have this essay that due on wednesday but think i'm there only have two things of reading that are due for monday they're very long but only two things and then book that have to finish by thursday and then but have uh like my essay and also my novella that i'm writing so working on that too but the main stressor was we went to the black legacy ball tonight which it was just so stressful getting everybody ready and like getting everybody there and people only wanted to take pictures and ended up taking one of my lorazepams which are very nice just like because did not realize how stressed was and took it and was like can actually function now um but but then didn't goes to the afterparty which also i'm glad i'm happy didn't do that because then probably just would have been more stressed and like leaving was even stressing me out because people was being slow and didn't always [inaudible] it was gonna be in um but it over now and got to hang out with some of my friends we just got to listen to music and that part was really fun and really chill and we just got to sit and listen and just hang out and not and so that part i'm really happy about that and that was the highlight so at least it not like something where was pissed off the whole time which would have been bummer since it was really cool place got to spend time with my friends so i'm happy that there was there was that time where can look at him and be like nothing went wrong in that period of time when was there 
180,so today was it was fine day nothing really happened did lot of work did like the last little bits of edits for my gov paper started my af am lit paper have probably big three pages done so that great um it'll probably end up being like six pages and which is perfect since five to seven pages um then finished all my gov readings and read 112 pages of my book for lit summer which is great and um did some writing for the book so it was like really really productive day today i'm glad um but it was my friend birthday today so we spent some time with her was doing homework with her and stuff and we had like little surprise party thing it wasn't even party we just surprised her and gave her cookie cake and then she went off to go to the concert that she was going to with her friend oh one of my friend was being like especially just irritating just she was being really short and she was like oh this is what i'm doing well hold on i'm like well am we not gonna do something together she just wasn't like being agreeable so that was extremely frustrating and was like yeah well i'm not doing any of this this is what everybody else can figure out and i'll just tag along 
181,so today was kind of like stressful day guess just because had so much work to do this is always my mondays and tuesdays and [inaudible] there so much reading really think that it hard to get this reading done though during the weekend also like the reading for mondays and then also [inaudible] reading for wednesday like um that that lot think that what need to do is make my wednesday more productive 'cause like wednesday night come home and don't do anything so wednesday night is gonna be the day when start um like reading for the next mondays so that can get that stuff done earlier um but went to the gym today so the gym today that was really great i'm feeling good and like am exercising um got kinda sad today because of the the guy from [inaudible] just because like what if he not interested in me and bla bla bla bla and didn't really know what to think about that situation 
182,so today actually wasn't such bad day um got up went to work did good amount of work um like the work work and then did like little bit of homework but got done all of my gov things that wanted to get done there was one like 68-page paper that wasn't just told myself i'm not gonna read it like at that point but it was just like way too long and it was dumb federalist paper so just looked up the summary but read 70 pages of my book and also wrote pages of one of my essays and also sent in my questions for the gov class and for my [inaudible] class so all of that done the only things left that have that due wednesday mean thursday is um my uh my book that have to read and only have 70 pages left so can get that done tomorrow um uh went to the gym last night and had bar wrong when was doing my squats so my neck hurts and my legs is sore so i'm gonna do little bit of stretching and then i'm gonna go to bed 
183,so today woke up and was super sick still um was feeling terrible but still went to class um don't know class was fine was not feeling good but [then] went to cvs after that and got myself some medicine and decided not to go to my other class just because was like need to rest um and got the draft of my essay done and finished my book so that good um and then got all of my like mcb stuff ready for studying but tomorrow i'm going to start studying for afam and mcb but mainly afam and at some point i'm gonna need to start my gov midterm so um i'm little stressed about all of this oh and also need to edit that paper and also continue writing my um my little novel thing so pretty stressed should not be going to bed right now but going to be going to bed right now because am sick don't have lot of energy to do anything so i'm gonna take the for the day but tomorrow i'm gonna be productive and i'm gonna get shit done i'm going to edit my draft i'm going to um make theses for my two gov midterm questions and i'm going to print out all of my thing for afam and i'm going to go through my notes i'm gonna highlight thing that am important and then also need to go so going to print out that um thing the study guide that they sent us and then i'm also going to print out the lecture slides 'cause that have all the faces of people that need to know that that what i'll do tomorrow and then on different day i'm gonna go and i'm gonna make list of all of the of all of the little [inaudible] that we have in the call and response book and i'm going to um and i'm gonna write the name of the article and the year name of the people and their year and then i'm going to do like two-sentence summary of each thing which i'm pretty sure can do i'm gonna do that on friday friday is gonna be my afam day and my um gov day so i'm gonna try to get draft done of one of my gov thing done one of my gov questions done wanna have the gov thing done by the end of the weekend that feel like that good idea so [go for] the gov and and um afam by the end of the weekend 
184,so today was an extremely stressful day just because just had all of these realizations of um don't know just everything that have to do and it just really been stressing me out um but it is late so stayed up and got all my homework well not all my homework but got good portion of stuff done edited my paper went through all my afam notes listened to the lecture did an good gov prep stuff for section um i'm slightly worried about afam but not as much so my plan now is to go through and um go through all of my readings the short readings in the little book and then write down the title and who wrote it little summary like one-sentence summary then one-sentence like bio of who that person was and also like dates important dates or years or whatever um and then within that do like what sort of debate it talking about or can like even separate them into different the readings into different groups of shit so um think that'll be good and then just need to go through and find pictures of look at all of the pictures and practice identifying them and for all like the important person like my tf said that you should know all of the person if you've been like paying attention in class so i'm sure it'll be something like phillis wheatley or it not gonna be somebody easy like frederick douglass or mlk but somebody like phillis wheatley or um zora neale hurston somebody like that where it was still like prominent figure or even malcolm maybe it was prominent figure but it didn't necessarily have it weren't like the driving person um but tomorrow i'm gonna work on gov it gonna be gov day tomorrow um but also have the career fair so that'll take up big portion of my time but that is okay um only printed out 10 of my resumes though we'll see how many person actually need to give my resumes to but no life is stressful but we're gonna get through it and started talking to the prince dude again and love them he so great he just good person ugh life 
185,so today started off so unbelievably stressful just because had like so much to do and still have lot to do but i'm feeling less stressed feel like lot better for because was really productive so first woke up went to lunch came back um what did do when first got back oh did like like working on my figuring out what was gonna do for the [inaudible] thing didn't like sit down and make thesis but kind of like figured out what was gonna talk about um and then did other stuff just like prep for other classes and thing and then um also started to kind of like write all that stuff down in my computer but then went to career fair just kinda stressful because then it just like all of this financing consulting and technical stuff like so much technical stuff uh all of this private-sector jobs the ones that are recruiting this are the kind of jobs that people get like good money right out of college but then the kind of stuff that i'm looking to isn't like advertised or isn't recruiting and don't even know what want go into so might apply for this [redacted] consulting group externship thing but don't know um we-we'll see the other thing that was thinking was um oh but got like an outline done so have two like mini-essays for [inaudible] got the intro for for both of that done and then like sort of just the idea outline for the rest of it so i'm so happy about that and then also did the thing where went through and listed all of the the readings that we have the the names the of the author the article names or the readings names the date and then went through and did ones sentence one- or two-sentence summary for the author and then one- or two-sentence summary for the readings it was just kind of like refreshing my memory on what the language was like so that when can when we have like the id thing then can be read it and be like oh this are this um and got through probably two-thirds and have like one-third left but it all of the recent stuff so that'll be really easy to go through and do um and what else oh wrote four pages for my story so now i'm up to seven which are great i'm so happy about that 
186,so my day has been pretty good today we went to the [inaudible] thing which was really fun and that guy that hooked up with when was at home who like made me [inaudible] and he was like really great guy he back in boston and he actually spending the night tonight we went out to dinner and we also went out to drinks and managed to get few drinks too um so that was like it was really fun and it made me feel like an adult like him and he really cool but it kinda sucks that he lives in new york city so the only times will actually get to see him are like random times when he comes to boston or like don't know if go to new york at any times you know he nice he-he also really smart he really cool he treats me like i'm smart 
187,so today um it was fun day um woke up in the guy that spent the oh yeah he spent the didn't say that he spent the night last night um he slept in different bed which was mean would have liked to sleep next to him it weird because when other people sleep over don't always like want to sleep with him think it only happened really with the the guy um the colombian dude that hooked up with from [redacted] like couple times like wanted to actually sleep at night with him um [inaudible] mean like this guy but no nothing would ever like be able to work so that like uh don't know just enjoy it and have fun when we can i'm sure in like couple day i'll be over it over this kind of feeling of wanting to be here um but let see what else went to my friend house for the uh brunch it was really fun to be with friend and also to eat good food then was really productive got my [inaudible] essay edited and got finished my gov midterm and also edited that um and also studied lot for my [inaudible] midterm so i'm feeling like i'm feeling pretty good about it um didn't do any of my gov readings but you know that okay gotta take [inaudible] every once in while um maybe i'll do the readings maybe not we'll see um and let see what else think that was really kind of it i'm still like little stressed i'll go over my stuff little bit more in the morning so could remember dates um and then think will um but mean i'm not gonna convince myself of anything it really could be terrible midterm 
188,today was stressful but good day um had my midterm my afam midterm think it went well there was only like few minor things that could have missed points for but nothing that was like glaringly wrong like knew everything so that good um and uh went to work and had great time at work it it was sorting day today so um got to see them press the the randomized button um and so that locks everything and um was at work went to dinner with some of my friends just in the dining hall um snapchatted this one dude who is gay dude that lives in the in the house with the dining hall that we was [eating] in and got felt kinda weird 'cause it was like hmm [inaudible] to give me attention but then he didn't text me back so but now i'm kinda feeling like don't need it well not that don't well don't need it but just that still kinda want it but know that it like wouldn't do anything for me so feel like that good and i'm recognizing that um did my gov midterm is ready to turn in my afam paper is ready to turn in did my all of my afam readings for afam 10 and um for intro to [inaudible] intro to afam and then have only have one more readings to do for gov 10 so just need to do and have one more 20-page oh 10-page readings 12-page readings have 12-page readings for my other afam class 'cause did the other readings for th-that class so don't have that much to read um probably no more than some hour it was worth of readings then just need to do blog posts study for my mcb midterm on monday and then do some more writing with the story and then we'll be good so think tomorrow when i'm at work i'm gonna do the readings then i'm gonna go and i'm gonna print everything out then i'm gonna do the blog posts and some writing the blog posts will take five minutes each so i'm not too worried about that and then i'll go to the orchestra then will study for mcb and we is going to survive 
189,today was relatively productive mean didn't have that much to do turned in my af msa turned in my gov 10 midterm printed it out so that can hand it in person um finished all my readings did my both of my afia posts finished the draft for the prologue studied so now all have to do is just send in my gov 10 questions for lecture on thursday and then we'll be good and have my last midterm tomorrow and mean guess need to edit the prologue um and kind of want them el standard but don't know like who 'cause i'm also embarrassed of my writing but definitely should not just be turning that in by myself so maybe i'll have my dad do it don't know life is confusing and hard 
190,so today was pretty good um it like housing day eve right now so we're going to bed it kind of late though and wish went to bed earlier had my last midterm and it was like all right know missed the first two questions which really sucked but those are only worth one point so it shouldn't be those bad like if get everything else right should still get an on it which cross my fingers but don't know it just made me feel kind of dumb those was like studying so much and was helping all my other friends like was basically teaching them how to do it yet couldn't do it myself so don't know there was just like lot was still confused with like the wording of of the questions so yeah um i'm excited to get my house but just those people have been stressing me out so much so can't wait until spring break comes and it just gonna be me and my friends from home and we don't have to worry about anybody else and i'll just be like alone and it'll be chill don't have to worry about like spending being with somebody being with all of these people for so long 
191,so today was housing day which was amazing got well probably shouldn't say what housing place took but it wasn't one of like my top six but i'm actually so excited that i'm here because it just amazing it just ano th-the best house it was like originally my favorite house when first got here but then was like hmm want these other place too they're little bit better but i'm like hmm no [inaudible] perfect location great [co] um good grill good community pretty house all that good all that jazz um felt kind of bad though 'cause in the very beginning was like not excited but then am now very excited only issue is that the dude who um like sexually harassed me also lives in these house so i'm not in his group he was actually the one who stormed my dorm but he didn't actually come in he just waited outside so i'm really not happy about that and don't really know what i'm gonna do do i'm pretty sure will just like tell my um i'll tell my advisor and then we'll see if we can have like meeting with his like resident dean or something to make sure that i'm not close to him but don't know don't want that to sacrifice me being in good entryway 'cause that would really suck if was like in one of the outside one that not connected to the room it connected to the main building but like yeah don't know it weird lives 
192,so today was the last mean it friday first day of spring break and did absolutely nothing today except for watch tv and hang out with friends guess take showers um it was pretty chill day went to the [osl] talked to the housing department guy to be like hey what could do about the guy from the beginning of the semester who oh forgot did [do my thing] yeah did um who the the dude who like sexually harassed me what do do about that told him about it he was like i'm gonna you should go talk to the title ix people and we'll schedule meeting with um the [redacted] director so am going to go meet with her and then also the title ix people i'm also meeting with my advisor just to like chat one as dean two as like my advisor to be like what do do also he texted me today and was like hey congrats on getting into [redacted] bladdy bladdy blah we should talk so that we can like move on from things and it actually really made me mad because remembered that before he said we can talk when when i've moved on like he ha probably still ha not recognized that he ha done anything wrong despite the fact that anything that would've done which was just air quote leading him on which was because didn't have like the emotional capacity to tell him that didn't want him to be touching me like that like he uh he would've expected me he knew was uncomfortable he said to me can see you're uncomfortable so now i'm thinking why didn't you stop then if you saw that was uncomfortable you should have stopped because in that position was not emotionally able to say stop especially when was around people we he would do it when we would we was in public and that he would be touching me in ways that would make me uncomfortable and wo would not be the kind of people to say you need to stop and so don't know that [ugh] and then was talking to the housing dude and he was like yeah i've seen how you act in the office and the ways that you're acting right now is completely different so this obviously is something that stressing you so he he wasn't like you need to go talk to him but he was like would suggest that you go talk to him and see like what you can do about this and then told one of my friends and she thought that was overreacting but then was like yeah must have not told you everything then which is just another testament to the fa uh to the magnitude of like how this is affecting me because when things like that happen don't talk to people about it like it it not something that like want to address when when it gets to be that point where don't want to address it it like just can't that mean that it it like really affecting me so this is all stressing me out but i'm gonna talk to my advisor and we am going to um i'll talk to him and be like should actually have conversation with him should not should just like let title ix people deal with it don't know so i'll just wait i'm gonna wait until see him 
193,so don't know today was like it was pretty good day um woke up went to like basketball-watching party thing and got free lunch with my friend and then went to the art museum and do some reading then came back watched some reality tv which was fun and then like sexted this one dude and like haven't done it in really long time but didn't like send pictures just we was just like talking dirty which was um you know it was kind of funny so then like started talking to him afterwards and so maybe we will actually meet up when we get here was like let go out on date first because don't really like going on hookups without knowing somebody he was like yeah sure so we'll see if that happens then my friend from home came he here he ate then we smoked some weed and now we're going [to bed] have fun week coming up so very excited about that and what else what else what else what else what else might go to new york [inaudible] [week] friend is here very happy

201,so am very unhappy at the fact have to go back to school tomorrow um just because i'm thinking of all that have to do to just catch up not that i'm i've missed stuff it just that don't feel like it feel like i'm not that i'm behind on the material but just behind on the on like ways of thinking and it just wake-up call that i'm not as good at school as like really wanted to and was talking to one of my friends about like consulting and stuff and how you still have to have good grades even though you don't really have to focus on anything in general but i'm back home and it is really nice to be back at home 
202,today was really really really bad day um was just so stressed out with all of my classes and my reading and stuff like that and just like having to go back to gov 10 was terrible it was so bad um almost cried in the dining hall at breakfast and then also at lunch and then also at my intro to afam classes like three times um also at work almost did but work has just been like getting so much better like that was definitely the highlight of my day was so happy well wasn't so happy but it was just nice to be away from everything and didn't has to worry about school or anything even though i'm still sort of worrying um stressed about dudes so i'm stressed about the senior don't know what to do with him i'm stressed about the guy from new york don't know what to do with him also the guy from amherst who hooked up with now it want me to come to the social no not the social but um crew formal with him and then also has to play the party for orchestra just there so much going on 
203,today was like [inaudible] weird day just because um started feeling really stressed about work and just like life and stuff and then when was at work was getting stressed about life but then like started doing things where like just started to go to this consulting um uh recruiting lunch and um um um my friend from work then came and talked to me and started feeling better but didn't get as much work done as wanted to orchestra was today and it was good but um okay don't know it was kind of weird long day where didn't actually do as much as thought would do or as like wanted to do 
204,so today kind of sucked um really wasn't that great of day was just having bunch of mood swings so sometimes things was going well and actually don't even know if it was going well was originally gonna go office hours at 900 am but then slept in so didn't do that and um lecture was boring the both of my classes in the mornings and then mcb was also boring and really didn't wanna go to that um but was just like feeling really stressed out about um my friends just because feel like it kind of aren't like know it still like me but nobody is like [redacted] come do this things with me or like we're all together talking and it will they're not talking to the group they're just talking to somebody else within the group um which that didn't make me feel good so then like if wasn't saying like what to somebody then wasn't included and like we all went to lunch together but then it put their stuff down and there wasn't enough room for me to sit was like all right well okay guess don't have to sit with you all um yeah almost cried in [inaudible] break again today things am just hard 
205,my day was all right today um woke up early so that because had to do postering for orchestra um and then like went to class and stuff but my class ended up being late and my professor didn't even come so we was just like all us dudes was just talking um and it was nice and chill and stuff but it was like whatever um and went to my gov section and got and like it was actually like really really productive class was super surprised um and got 93 on my midterm for afam which was great very happy about that um what else was feeling really kind of lonely today don't know why but also busy but barely did any work got the all of the readings done for gov 10 for monday except for one but it like 40 pages so we'll see if if read it so then all have to do is start on the stuff for afam and afam 131 and i'm not even gonna do my psats so i'll do that in section on monday so this weekend really shouldn't be that bad and i'm going to the formal on saturday and tomorrow have the party that i'm planning which should be really fun 
206,so today was like pretty um it was really productive day guess just in the sense that got all of my readings done for [inaudible] and got almost all of my [inaudible] readings done but don't think i'm gonna finish that one just because it like it makes me so mad might not and what else so um also got all my stuff also got all my stuff ready for just like readings over this weekend and tomorrow i'm gonna go to [redacted] so should have everything done or at least good portion of everything done so that won't be that pressed for time and think i'll be good and we had my orchestra party thing today which it went pretty well which i'm excited about um yeah mean there weren't as many people as hoped but it was still good amount of people which was guess happy about um and mean like right now i'm feeling really lonely just in the sense that wish could be dating somebody and was talking to my orchestra friends about the guy from [inaudible] and just hope that uh he like me or that thing might work out with him in the future but part of me needs to like just chill out and understand that i'm not gonna be able to be with him right now that he many not like me and that he [inaudible] one place probably um like tinder or something so shouldn't be like limiting myself think it just like an internal issue of just becoming calm and realizing that an for this situations can't be controlled by me so just needs to let him go about their course and just let whatever happen happen 
208,despite the fact that had really really fun time yesterday and also this morning feel like today has just been mean this week has just been garbage like i've been so unhappy with my academic performance i'm just unhappy with myself in general and with just being here and being with friends like just feel like an outsider like nobody actually wants to hang out with me or talk to me and has this like feeling that if don't text people or anything maybe only few are gonna be like hey man let go do this make it really don't make me feel good at all but so woke up today with guy and we went out to brunch and he tour guide 400 are or so went on one of his tour and then drove me back here with zipcar we went to dinner and then he drove back did little bit of homework and now i'm going to bed but don't know just just really didn't don't i'm not happy that i'm back and got an an essay uh got plus on it but it like don't even has faith in myself anymore so then before was happy it was like you know what fine i'll live with it but then now i'm like just fuck do it even matter like should even continue trying this house just really sucks and before was like and now i'm just thinking about different things like what about the senior who go here what about the guy from [redacted] that was just with what about the guy from [redacted] that was hanging out with what about the guy from [redacted] it like there so much going on and don't know how to sift through any of this stuff but think need to tell the guy from [redacted] that like like having fun with him and like talking to him but just wants him to know that can't be in relationship with somebody who far away and just hate having that conversations hate him so much because it feel so bad ugh just are not in good place right now 
209,today was an absolutely garbage day am so angry about being here hate the work hate my classes like told my blocking group that didn't wanna live with them and everyone went crazy they're oh my god they're all so frustrating but the guy that i'm rooming with who was gonna room with talked to he the only calm one see all of the girls was freaking out and it doesn't even affect them at all huh so hmm am going to stay with my blocking group because i'm gonna be with the dude who is very he uh normal person and my other blocking mates am just petty and annoying they're just annoying me right now yeah also just classes in general kind of fucking sucks and we had the advising for uh just [inaudible] i'm just not happy right now and was really happy this past weekend and now i'm not happy um just wanna sleep but have too much to do maybe this week i'll this weekend i'll just like sleep like friday i'm not gonna get out of bed or something doesn't know 
210,things really are not going well right now with just like life and classes and things in general uh woke up and was just angry at my block mates until one of them like apologized and then the other one was like saw that was in the library so she came down and talked to me so think she are realizing how she was being disrespectful and just like inconsiderate um but i'm still like my other friend are still pr think she still like all torn up about everything and then now i'm backing off and think she can sense that i'm backing off and yeah so one of them ta came and talked to me tonight and was just trying to be nice and then another one like wants to get breakfast with me and then just like with all of grades and stuff that just don't feel smart feel like there so much that have to do it not that i'm overwhelmed yet it just that it it just work that don't wanna do and then i'm not and i'm just not enjoying anything i'm not happy with anything that i'm doing right now and wants it all to be over just wants the semester to be over and then i'm also just like torn up because don't know what to think about just like my friend in general and how just like act around people and like just barely talked to anybody today and didn't really wants to talk to anybody today but went to the and uh what are with me needing to be in relationship don't know why can can't just be happy on my own talked to the guy from was trying to talk to the guy from [redacted] today but mean the conversation there wasn't that much and it wasn't that great of conversation he could tell was getting stressed out and then this other senior he he uh he don't do anything bad wrong it just that like he was like you can come and spend the night tonight but then was tired and he tired and really did just wanna go to bed and just sleep next to somebody then he like but have to wake up at 600 so you'd probably have to leave at 600 so i'm like don't wanna do that now i'm in bed laying and silently crying 
211,so today um it was not the best again this week just isn't great woke up was sad um wasn't excited to go to gov 10 now i'm even more stressed out just because don't wanna like participate in that um debate thing that we have to do tomorrow so that was stressing me out also had to sit with all of my track dude friends this morning for breakfast even though wanted to eat alone but one of them sat down and then the rest swarmed was like all right great and um also one of my friends from my blocking group she like in the class with me and we was both like obviously irritated with the whole situation so that was like kind of [comfortable] and saw my other friends in my blocking group and was still angry at them didn't really wanna see them was actually on the phone my sister then talking about them because was angry and every time tell anybody they're like what the fuck that just dumb that they're acting that way so don't know what really going on and had my orchestra dress rehearsal tonight it went all right except one girl fell so that not the best and i'm probably only gonna be able to go to ballet for like don't know 30-ish minutes because call time at 715 so maybe won't go to no i'm gonna stop by for just little bit um let me think afam was terrible also because my friends from my blocking group was there basically just wanted to be alone the whole time um so but yeah all in all life is not going very well but am walking to go spend the night with this one senior dude that have been talking to so hopefully that will go well and make me feel better 
212,today was uh don't even know why wh how to describe today um it was kind of nice guess with my seminar my seminar is like such fun place to be in my professor like called on me and it wasn't anything bad at all it was just like you know don't really know well it not that do know what going on in my class it just kind of feel dumb because i'm the only freshman and then there is like four grad students or i'm lied there is three grad students hmm one no there is four there is four grad students and three undergrads so just feel like dumb person um but need to need to like stop i'm drunk right now and had really great talk okay so no that another thing is had my orchestra concert today and then afterwards there was reception where there was some like alcohol and shit so my friend and we stole [laughter] three bottles of alcohol of like wine and then she came back over and we was like drinking we drank bottles of wine and started talking um so now i'm very drunk um well not very drunk but i'm i'm pretty drunk and um we had like lot of good conversations about just like not only orchestra but then also just about like her and culture and how everyone like so so concerned about like her profession and grades and it really did make me feel like that stuff don't really matter that much and know it don't matter that much but just need like somebody else to like within [redacted] community to tell me that and so i'm very happy that we was able to have these conversations that we that we had tonight and that like had really great time with her um and then also just like came to terms with the fact that like spending the night with with that guy that was with last night the only person that like spending the night with was the guy from [redacted] who went to see so know i'm drunk right now so drunk person is her real selves so maybe that means that wanted to be in relationship with him yeah know except he did he like still not the best at texting me which feel like if we're going to have long-distance relationship you have to be somewhat good at at texting not just like he 100 you have to be responding every second it just like if something warrants response or not even warrants response but uh response would be expected then he should respond but he don't do it all the time 
213,today was pretty chill day woke up was still drunk which kind of fucking sucked um and then was just kind of like doing my own thing went cop breakfast saw my friend then went back home and did some writing got 10 pa wrote wrote 10 full pages plus little bit on some eighth pages today which is lot and i'm very very satisfied with that and then also did little bit of reading but think the rest of the weekend is just mainly gonna be reading probably doing little bit of writing so i'm very happy about that um didn't actually see that many people but called the guy from [redacted] we had nice hour-long chat and also called the guy from new york and we had we had good chat too um and was supposed to go out on date with that senior dude who go to [redacted] but then was like you know what don't really want that too so we ended up not going out which i'm happy with but then went out because one of my girls' senior friend was like hey come to this party there bunch of gays so we did and then just like made new friend with this one black dude um and we went to like another party and then we went to grill to go eat and yeah had good time um and it was just kind of like chill day you know didn't talk too many people didn't see many people was okay with it because it was like hungover the whole day it was happy but didn't have to deal with anything 
214,today was pretty chill day um woke up got ready did some reading got finished all my gov 10 reading for monday finished all my afam reading for monday did little bit wrote like one more page so now all have to do for the weekend is read the souls of black folk which i'm not gonna do all of i'm just gonna read like some of it um at least 100 page though i'm gonna get 100 page done um and read the souls of black folk and then just do little bit more writing think four more page is doable because then just like get in the groove of doing the research part of well mean i'm [inaudible] interaction but didn't really interact with any people during the day like went to lunch and who did eat lunch with oh yeah ate lunch with some of my friends from my blocking group um and we kind of had talk about life in the blocking group and how we're just little worried because things is like starting to we're starting to move further apart but then one of the other girls in my blocking group um texted me and she was like hey wanna come get some lunch with me and my cousin she in town and so went with them didn't actually like get any food just got drink but [inaudible] to talk to people um and then had my orchestra concert again tonight and it was not like the it wasn't great the brass section really not good so that kind of some issue um but yeah it was pretty chill day barely talked to anybody which it was nice to do that and but it was super nice outside 
215,so today um kind of [inaudible] day didn't do much really didn't talk to many people at all went to brunch with two of my blocking mates and one cousin for like an hour so it was good but then did lot of reading read like hundred and 100 pages of my book so only have 30 more left and it due thursday so that good that don't have that much to do in that class and then did lot of writing just now read wrote probably um oh wait let see oh wrote five pages five pages double-spaced yeah uh let let say four wrote four pages double-spaced um which is pretty good um but kind of wanted it to be wrapped up by now but it not so think have like little bit more that need to add for [inaudible] but that don't really matter um uh just got back my mcb midterm and got an [81] so not too happy about that so it just means that really need to work harder on everything else um guess maybe i'm just student because that all that really is only get bs in in things which just need to be okay with guess um but went to [redacted] to eat with um this one junior so that same people went to brunch with came and ate with us um she really cool and really like her but don't think one of the other girls in the blocking group like her but you know what whatever [inaudible] to her own uh so now just wanna go back and go to sleep and not do anything but i'm glad that we only have four more weeks of school 
216,so today was actually pretty good day um like don't know it started off as good got little bad got good again got little bad but it got good again um woke up went to breakfast saw couple of my friends but was really kind of feeling out of it was um little sad not sad but just kind of like confused about what how to think about this whole situation with the guy from amherst because was texting him last night before went to bed and he was like yeah i'm probably gonna come out [inaudible] this weekend we're trying to figure out car so that we can get there um so like that but it was ju-just weird because he wasn't giving me like definitive answers and wanna be like wait so which day was you gonna come are you gonna stay with me assumed that he would be staying with me but was gonna be like [inaudible] make sure uh what night are you staying uh blah blah blah blah but then he don't know he just he text it not that he text weird it just like i'm don't think he like texting so he just don't isn't like very great at communicating but anyways so whatever um but [yu di do di do] gov 10 political theories sucked [inaudible] it was good lecture but then at lunch was like poop i'm feeling kind of sad just because of like gov 10 feel like i'm dumb all of the goo normal stuff with with gov 10 but then we got my paper prompts and one of the prompts was literally the essay that the like the essay proposal that gave to my tf when was ins um office hours just being like hey are would this be something that would work for future essay and it was literally the exact question um so don't know maybe he was looking after me maybe i'm just so clairvoyant but we don't whatever who cares um so that felt good but then went to work and love my coworkers they're so great just being able to talk to him about everything that going on especially just with this amherst dude and then comparing it to stuff with the tufts dude [ugh] but it it convinced me don't put ins lot of work into this amherst dude because long distance are hard especially if you start him long distance like it it just probably don't invest especially money or emotion so and if it can't communicate well then you know that [it just not gonna] go well so yeah um but then went to this um queer people of color thing like spa day um and that was really really good and then also finished chapter two so now only have chapter three and the epilogue to do i'm so happy 
217,um today started off as really really good day just woke up and went to work was hap was happy um and then got like to lunch and my friend was like come eat lunch with me so then did but she was at table with bunch of people that didn't know and she ended up like didn't even talk to her that much and then when did she was talking to her about one of the guys that matched with on tinder and she was like no he not gay and i'm like what are you talking about so um that was kind of frustrating but then oh went to go talk to the [inaudible] people about the whole thing with the the dude that i'm having issues with and she was like oh yeah well we don't really do mediated meetings so probably not gonna deal with her anymore um and saw him walking home from that meetings actually smiled at me and reactively smiled back but then was like fuck just want to get out of here uh and then went to orchestra had great time came back just finished up some reading did little blog post um edited both chapters that need to edit and then also uh but then people in my blocking group texted about like some [cumba] thing she was just being so obnoxious and was like all right well guess we're going to be rude today for no apparent reason we didn't have to then talked to this other girl in my blocking group and she was like yeah they're really just this are just unnecessary so just do not disturb that chat i'm not going to do that i'm just not even gonna pay attention to that anymore i'm just gonna like let it die cause people are just being obnoxious in it um yeah i'm trying not to let that get to me this are gonna be good week i'm not going to let something dumb ruin it i'm saying no to bullshit 
218,today was great day um so got up went to breakfast with this one dude that was talking to on tinder for little bit um he like kinda cool but i'm not interested in him was just like excited that could go out to breakfast with somebody which was nice and then went to office hours for my gov 10 tf and we like talked through my paper and he was like yeah this is great do this this and this he like helped me so know what i'm doing for that which is awesome i'm so happy about that um and then went to my lectures got to eat lunch by myself bought myself some ramen watched some netflix and it was really nice to be able to like chill and step back from everything and not have to worry about anything and then went to my mcb lectures it was pretty good lectures and then went to um my and then went to the gym for little bit so did some squats and some chest flies which was great and then went to romance languages dinner thing with one of my block mates and we had really great time and it was really cool and some intellectual space came back did some work was working on my gov 10 paper because don't have anything that due tomorrow or anytime soon so was like you know what we're just gonna think ahead so have two out of the seven pages done um and then i'll probably do little bit more tomorrow definitely wanna get at least five pages done by the end of friday feel like um feel feel like 100 draft done by the end of saturday without doubt um and then went called the amherst dude we talked on the phone for solid 30 minutes which was really fun i'm glad that could catch up with him and then went to one of my friend rooms with like down the hall from me and we had wine night so that [where i] was like doing my writing and we was talking and it was it was good time yeah today was good day it was really good day think was kind of missing out on was kind of sad like about few thing just with the guy who didn't like message me back on tinder and one of my friend got [prepunched] and i'm going to the event with her but was sad that didn't get [prepunched] by anybody but you know what it fine it don't really matter that much um but i'm excited for this weekend and i'm excited that all of this stuff is getting done yeah 
219,so today started off started out as great day um was just feeling happy it was really sunny out but then don't know things have been not that they've been going downhill it just that it kind of like there been slight um just it been slight descent guess um just went to my seminar class and don't know people keep talking and that just kinda makes me feel dumb just because i'm the only freshman it like freshman seniors and then there freshman two seniors and then four grad students so don't really feel feel definitely feel like the outlier who just like kind of there giving like not very substantial claims don't know it really feel really weird came there to give the emotional side of things and that the only things that can really contribute or that feel like can contribute and then like don't know didn't see that many people texting my my blocking group have been texting in the group chat again and and that just seem that kind of frustrated me for some reason even though it don't need to um went to ballet and was also like kind of not really liking it which was weird that the only time that that happened um yeah don't know it was weird day it wasn't like there was anything bad there just wasn't anything really that great um and don't know not many feel like nothing really worth explaining with mean it okay so like went to breakfast with my one friend this other dude that like me was there and so it was kinda could tell that he was that he felt awkward um that he felt nervous um and then went to class and then went to lunch with my friend had halal which was delicious um and and then we went to the library and did some research um for one of my final projects and then what did do after that and then went to [gov] section and that just didn't talk much but was like you know well don't really wanna talk much so didn't said like three things which mean that fine yeah i'm don't know it just right now feel like kinda weird and went over to my neighbor room and he was like come and hang out with me and so was like okay so went over there but then there was lot of people so then got stressed out and it was all drunk and so was like i'm gonna go 
220,today um don't know it was weird day it was like kind of good but then also kind of not great just was doing lot of homework oh did went to one of my professor office hours and um we talked about my novella that i'm writing and like techniques of how should be doing that like what what the best way to write this especially since mine is non-linear timeline like how am gonna make sure that it all flows and works and then the and then we also had good talk about like what it means to [reach hope] in class um which was kind of like an interesting thing just when um talking about race like it was really and then she emailed me afterwards and she was like yeah um this is this article that was thinking of after we finished my talk and it was really good talk so was like hmm that it made me feel good that she also thought that it was like good intellectual conversation guess which is always nice to hear that somebody else thinks that too um but [inaudible] is coming tomorrow which i'm very excited about that also my blast out-of-orbit performance for my orchestra and ballet thing um but basically actually no um don't know didn't see that many people today felt kind of lonely though um and also kind of bad for myself but don't really know why thinks it was just the weather oh had an interview for summer job though that thinks went pretty well i'm not entirely sure though i'm just really critical of myself my knee hurts but did finish dov draft of my gov paper so maybe when sunday night i'll go sunday night or monday night i'll go to the writing center thinks it open on sunday night but maybe it not but then monday night i'll go to the writing center and just have them like read it over and just wanna make sure that like my theses kind of travels and that the conclusion also make sense with with the paper 'cause uh this i'm gonna make this good paper this is gonna be i'm gonna get good grade on this um but just have ton of reading to do have to read two books for one class the other and they're long books too one is 300 pages one is like 150 pages so they're both due on thursday kind of stressed but you know what reading for other class just might not get done and you know what that okay 
221,so today started off as kind of like stressful day just because had to wake up early and then go to my orchestra like creative team thing but it was kinda fun to go to that just because um it fun to it like funny time where we're writing scripts so um yeah that was enjoyable and um actually contributed to some thing but then just did like little bit of work only some hour of homework and it was kind of sad but then did like my performance and striking the set um and then the guy from [redacted] came and he here now he in my room and we're about to go to bed but we went to um uh [pop's] with the orchestra um after-party it was like it was fun and i'm glad went and wish we could've stayed longer but then we met up with his friends that was here and got kind of like stressed out and don't forgot to take my medication today so i've been feeling kinda weird i've been disassociating lot where would just like stop like focusing stop like understanding where am and stuff and what i'm actually doing like i'm saying something and i'm like am actually saying the right words or am calling somebody the right name just kind of don't know thing like thing like that um yeah don't know it was weird feel weird right now 
222,so today was um it was pretty good day woke up and um said goodbye to the guy who spent the night and we ended up hooking up last night um which was like actually having sex was was really nice um and then did some homework so finished reading my book and finished all my gov reading and did little bit of essay editing yeah um it was pretty productive day like was working all day and did some writing too but um oh also went shopping with one of my friends and that was nice then went to brunch went to brunch with one of my friends she junior and um we had great time like it was we had really good talk about um school next year and like what need to be thinking about doing and then like my relationship life and hers and so it was good like mutual conversation and love having that where can have somebody who can listen to me but then also somebody who comfortable talking to me about talking with me about all of the like important things that are going on in their life and then we went to fashion show today which was super fun and yeah i've just been doing lot of lot of work but it was really fun was with my blockmates for the fashion show and it was like one of that time when we all get together that we know like why we like to hang out with each other 
223,so my day today was pretty normal feel like um wanna just kind of put moderate for everything basically like had some good things um had some good convos with my friends and stuff um but keep forgetting to call my parents and wanted to call my mom today but just didn't have any time which really kind of sucked um but actually did this really fun things so my friends is ves concentrator so they was making um movie things and they came over they was like [redacted] need you to comb bunch of coconut oil through your hair so they came over and we did that for little bit um but gave my gov 10 paper to one of my friends to edit which they was like they really good paper um and only gave me like few things to do like fixing couple of confusing sentences so i'm pretty i'm feeling pretty good about that so we'll see how the actual peer-reviewer um tackles that um but today was they was pretty productive which is great 
224,so today was actually not really the best day um woke up was extremely tired my stomach really hurt so didn't eat that much for breakfast and then went to work and one of my coworkers was really really irritating me she um we all have like the same job and basically the main thing that we do is answer the emails so get there like couple like 30 minutes late because was sick and she like not doing anything she just sitting with her homework and then say like pull up the emails box i'm like can you help me with some of these emails and she like oh just checked before and there weren't any and i'm like there is 12 emails here and you decided to not do any of that and then was like whatever and then she was like oh yeah guess i'll help and then i'm like doing my shit and then look over and she just staring at the same page it just so irritating when people don't actually fucking do anything that they're supposed to do while i'm actually working and then these other woman who work in the office she was like the one who interviewed me at the very beginning know that that woman don't like me and don't like her either frankly because she is rude as shit she do not talk to people in way that she deserve she very curt and can tell that she is all friends with everybody else in the office except for me and it like noticeable that she treats me differently [i would say she's] rude to me she short and she like ignores me and i'm i'm just really kind of irritated with that job in general right now and it just today i'm just so i'm extremely irritable today and then went to orchestra and was tired and everyone was being so loud and not listening not being productive and it was that was also really irritating me and then i'm like okay everything better i'm going to these one party it like pre-punch party thing with one of my friends and like that was fun going to the um to the whichamajig to the pregame and like talking to people and met some really cool girls and also sort of kind of like not really flirting but sort of flirting with these one dude who was pretty cool um and then we go to like the actual club where the party is and one of my friends she like let me buy you drink so i'm like okay i'm taking the drink and i'm drinking the drink and then some people comes and it like um you're not 21 and she kick me out of the party so then now i'm here back at home irrita 
225,today was relatively okay day um woke up was unbearably tired um really contemplated not going to class but got up did little bit of work at breakfast um and yeah did that talked to some friends at breakfast was just tired went to class to gov and was just so tired that almost fell asleep then my friends who in the class with me didn't go 'cause she slept in um so had nobody to uh make commentary with um and then went to af intro af am and also almost fell asleep um then but after that then went um to then went to work not to actually do work but she was having like bridal shower for one of the women who work in the office um so that was really fun um to go to that then skipped my mcb class today just because was unbelievably tired so went and napped for some hour and then read my 80 pages of my book that still have 130 pages to do even though it due tomorrow and then did like my gov questions and my af am seminar questions that am all turned in and i'm all prepped and ready for leading the class tomorrow for like some hour-ish and probably it gonna be less than that but you know what it like have sort of mini lecture going um but think it gonna be think it gonna go okay only have two more sections of gov left so happy about that and also started my oh oh had orchestra today 1000 to midnight which was relatively productive until like in the end when people started getting little rowdy and then was getting irritated even though like don't do anything in charge and just like noticing people being annoying that just annoys me even though the-they're not annoying me directly guess um yeah and at some point i'm gonna message that one dude and be like hey we should go get uh one of the dude from last night and be like we should go um get coffee together sometime but just need to do it 
226,so my day today was um it was all right i'd say it really kind of busy but didn't really get that much done if you like in comparison to other things like um woke up and just had to basically finish reading the book that had um to do but went to class and had to lead class for like 30 minutes but it kinda sucked because um was supposed to have probably like 45 minutes but really only had 30 minutes to do it and so the conversation really didn't get started until like the last 10 minutes um and think did okay for like starting an intellectual conversation but it just hard for me being in that space in particular just because half of the students was grad students but think my professor like understands that and like understands that i'm am working hard because i've been to her office hours twice and i've like emailed her lot about all this stuff just to like make sure that i'm on the right track and so think mean did all right with that um and then section for gov was really productive and talked lot but then [inaudible] only said one things [inaudible] to play devil advocate which i'm afraid people thought was being problematic but actually said i'm just playing devil advocate but mean [inaudible] the end of that is that i'm just so worried about what other people think of me so need to actually work on that um but called my parents and my sister today which was very nice and also messaged that dude that talked to at the pregame and gave him my number like in the first text in the first message and he immediately texted me after that so that made me feel good 
227,um so today was really good day um and now it doesn't isn't super the best how i'm feeling um so it started off woke up um went to breakfast saw some of my friends we was just like talking we was happy about the weather and the day um and it like my spring concert event thing um so like the whole campus was buzzing it was like there was lot of people out there and at first was getting really stressed just because like everybody was moving and i'm had lunch with my advisor today so like went down into the office and everyone there was like working lot and was like ah there so much going on right now um but then he and got to lunch and we had really really good convo just like just about life and stuff so was really happy with that and how that went um and it was nice to be able to catch up with him 'cause feel like haven't done that since the beginning of the semester um but liv love like getting close with him and stuff um and then after that just did little bit of work and so it was the um it was like the the it called yard fest so [inaudible] we texted my friends and was like hey do you wanna smoke to pre-game and she was like um no we're not gonna smoke but we're gonna go to this one party do you wanna come and was like you know what i'll go it'll be fun it good group of like four people so can hang out with him but then it turned out to be like really big party and it was super fun and talked to lot of people and um was like socializing lot and talked to people who like know but like never actually had conversations with him before um so that was like it was nice to be able to do that and then we went to the actual um concert and we was up at the front and then people was really shoving to point where everyone getting frustrated and then one of my friends was like let just go and was like you know what let so left the front and then we kinda just like hung around back with um like started out just the two of us then one of my other friends came for while and then some of my other friends like group of five of him came and so we was just there the whole time and we was having really fun time and and my and my one friends um and then but then um like one of the girls got invited to final club party was just thinking it kind of sucks that that doesn't know well one it girls get to go to that but can't so i'm always like left out 'cause all my friends are girls but then two um uh white guys white freshmen get to white freshmen dudes get to go to that too but then i'm like yeah they're gonna notice you and then you're gonna be black-listed and so i'm like fuck it sucks that i'm getting left out of this thing when other people isn't are like doesn't know 
228,today kinda sucked um woke up woke up didn't sleep as well as wanted to last night um woke up kind of early so could do homework but then ended up just laying in my bed and doing nothing and like watching tv which it was nice that got to watch tv but after laying in bed for so long then just start to feel like bored and gross um and then um did lot of homework which was good that was really productive today but then basically and barely saw anybody today like the only times did was like going to eat oh also went to my roommate talk about [inaudible] which was fun but um had conversation with the guy who lives in new york about like basically what my relationship is and think upset him but don't know what said that would've upset him because was like yo this is what i'm feeling and this is how it aligns with you and mean you mean something to me and so this is like what wanna do but just wanna know like where you're at so he was like yeah i'm i'll text you tomorrow and so texted him and was like i'm sorry if made you upset blah blah blah blah blah um let me know if can clarify anything he didn't respond but then went on snapchat and saw that he was like active an hour ago when texted him this like three hour ago so he on his phone he just decided not to respond so don't make me feel good um so yeah i'm actually like little pissed about that but don't even know what want from him you know maybe it that may- maybe this is the end who know but it sucks don't know why like get into things that know aren't going to work out it because love to sabotage myself 
229,so today um basically only did orchestra stuff like um woke up went to rehearsal from 1030 to to 130 then had brunch with my orchestra then went to go set up for the concert and then the concert was 400 to 600 and then cleaned up then went to dinner with couple friends and then came home and did like very minimal amount of work um like read for 30 minutes and then did two wrote two pages for my research paper but also talked to both of my parents on the phone and to the guy from new york on the phone and now i'm in bed because feel like garbage and don't wanna do anything so i'm just going to and whatever happen happen and might not go to class tomorrow oh my god just 'cause feel sick um but yeah didn't like all of not that many people came to my orchestra concert which made me kinda feel sad like it wasn't empty but not lot of people came and only only four of my friends came to see me which that kind of sucked 
230,so today didn't really do much was sick so stayed at home for most of the day went to breakfast and to gov10 'cause just had feeling that they was gonna take attendance and they did so i'm glad went but then didn't go to afam or go into work just because was like sick and they they wasn't good for anybody if was at work um but so just mainly stayed inside was actually got really mad at for little bit because my friends in my group chats like don't respond and they like i've said this so many times they don't respond to people even when ask explicit questions people don't respond and so last night one of them got mad because somebody else didn't respond to them and um but somebody like sent an instagram post to us all in my instagram um group chats like where we share memes and stuff then so they was like so we're not gonna do is share that pictures and not respond to us and then later ask questions i'm like can we go to dinner in [elliot] so that can buy my dues and they don't respond nobody respond and then they like 45 minutes later get notification saying blank shared this post with your group on your instagram so was literally like um i'm actually very angry that you did that when you said this morning that this is what we're not gonna do so what up with that um was very mad about that but um then went to section um for mcb and we went to different section so we could to the um black men forum um um elections and my the tf was the like super hot dude and they was they seemed like they was high the whole times which was hilarious but was like oh my god they has bedroom eyes oh wow they very attractive um but then after that so we went to dinner bought my house dues and um bought myself shirt um mean sweatshirt which is really cool so i'll wear that tomorrow i'm very excited but then we went to the bmf elections they was six hours long they went six hours and was like planning on not going except for my friends was running um and so was like okay should go with them but was like bmf is like really problematic space so i've never felt comfortable there just because they super hyper-masculine and so like didn't want to go but ended up going was like yeah whatever and um was planning on leaving um after my friends but then realized that the las that one of the chairs the inclusivity chairs was the dude running for was like homophobe so was like can't do this so stayed for all six hours to so could vote against them and like convince everybody in the deliberation process do not vote for for this people people that wanted to win won so they was very successful and i'm like actually really happy that went and that got to explain to this people like what they need to do to change 
231,so my day today um think it was pretty tame actually it was really nice went to work um and there was couple of instances when did the wrong thing and got little bit of pushback and was like oh got little embarrassed but now i'm like you know what people gotta chill because whatever you need is gonna get down so just calm down and then went downtown to get coffee with my friend from high school because she thinking about going to school in boston um so that was really nice i'm glad got to catch up with her and um like see somebody else see like familiar face um and then another thing is that let see what happened after that oh went with one of my other friend and she doing this like photography thing where um she taking portraits of people where it feel comfortable in her own space so she was like um so she was just like talking to me while we was um going around all of this places and stuff which um thought was like really cool um and she definitely did make me feel more comfortable about um like being having my picture taken because like am always awkward and don't know what to do with picture so that why like when somebody like let me take picture of you have to be drunk or something um but then went to the gym with one of my friend which made me feel great and we had good talk and he was also at the election the board election thing um and he was like yeah had no idea about that one dude that he was homophobic and stuff like that and he was like hope have never done anything like that and hope that you can like tell me and i'm like no bro it good you're good but um and that how was like talking to him about about that the homophobe dude and so then later this the guy that was hanging out with um that like went to the gym with goes to like brain break and eats and he like wait [inaudible] with him and then this dude and then he like hey yeah so mean like heard about people saying this kinds of thing and just wanted to know what your thought was like and then so that dude got mad at him and then like stormed off um but the homophobic dude also texted me and was like hey um let we should talk tomorrow and so like got that text and was like no don't want to so can't wait to tell my adviser about all of my [inaudible] drama shit he gonna be proud of me for going but then also don't know what to do about having this other conversation because i'm so shit and awkward and bad at making decisions 
232,um today was normal day uh class gov um we had to do this like little group thing and the senior girl who met at well not that met uh she been in my class but talked to her at yard fest and um and she in my section came down and did like little activity thing with me and my friend who sit with um in the lecture so it was kind of fun that she came down here and she was like oh see know you guys so i'm gonna come be friend and was like okay 'cause she really liberal and she cool um and then what else um oh the dude who like texted me last night was like we need to have talk was like all right come eat lunch with me but also just so you know all of my friend are gonna be here so she was all there and um it actually was pretty productive conversation just because he was like listening to me and it was kind of like was not like definitely was being polite and respectful but wasn't trying to sugarcoat thing which think was good and it was definitely like reality check for him um and he was like really receptive but then my other friend who like also you guys check me too whenever i'm doing something problematic and then they're like well let just tell you all this thing but like she was also doing it the same way in like in like respectful way but it was um still like this are what you do wrong and then then that when he started getting um to be more defensive which i'm like okay this dude are really only listening to me because i'm man um anyways then went to my mcb class and we had presentation and actually wasn't that nervous said um few times but it it wasn't that bad and then my professor was he said that great presentation so was like oh well sweet 'cause he liked it but also it was his paper that we was presenting on but no it okay it whatever um and then we had my midterm and think did pretty well on well obviously have no idea but felt well coming felt good coming out of it which you know i'm just gonna take that for what it worth um oh also got my dapa grant for my orchestra thing and asked for 40 but only got 20 but she was like it okay we sometimes don't get money um because she usually don't give money to like closed parties so we always like need to make sure we don't say that and was like oh well didn't know that and somebody said that it was closed parties um and she was like oh well we're actually very surprised that you did get any money then so guess i'm doing something right with getting grant um but then had my last study break which it was nice to see everybody guess but don't know after move i'm really not gonna see this people ever again 
233,my day today um was all right uh didn't do much work my brain kind of wasn't like working but it was my last day of my seminar which actually was kind of weird because we was talking about thing with the with the student who was rested um and don't know it was just kind of like hard to talk about that but especially because there was this other dude in the class who was like getting he was very vehement about his opinions to point where was like you kind of like and he was he was actually kind of like wild because this one girl said something and then he like was like uh-uh disagree with you on that because of blah blah blah blah blah and then in in his explanation he was kind of like giving an explanation for her thing and then my professor was like well see here why think you both are right because what you just said supports her claim with blah blah blah blah blah so was like okay professor um but oh watched little bit of um tv with that guy that met at the party um so that was really fun um we only just like hung out for like 30 minutes but it was still it wast still nice um and we're probably gonna hang out this weekend as we said um um don't know kind of didn't wanna in oh had my last day of ballet which now i'm sad that don't have that anymore because that was good was just learning how to like turn well so just need to practice that little bit more and then maybe i'll finally get better but felt kind of like disconnected from people today like it felt as if was just kind of like that extra friend who was just invited who was hanging out with everybody while it all did his own thing which that wasn't fun 
234,um barely did anything today like barely any work but that okay um but that really means need to do lot this weekend um when oh went to breakfast with my friend which was really nice because it almost the one-year anniversary of us being friend we met like on the first saturday of visitas which is means guess today but um then also went to lunch with this one dude but we just like went as friend which was kind of nice but he also really cute but i'd need to not like go for him um and means did like little bit of work mainly hang out with friend talked to the new york guy on the phone which liked um for some reason was really feeling attached to him today um but then like text my friend then was like want some edible do you have any suggestion of someone who can buy this from and then so she sent us this one dude where he had this edible that was 10 grams um for or 50 grams for 10 so was like um i'm gonna do the 50 for 10 get my money worth then eat the whole thing in one sitting which apparently you're not supposed to do and literally got so high thought was gonna die like called my friend and was like need you to come here and just like sit with us 'cause was getting so paranoid like thought was gonna die but then slept for two hours and then came back and had to go host my orchestra party from 1000 to 100 and that was [inaudible] too went back and i'm just exhausted 
235,today was um it was actually pretty good so woke up and then went to this protest for um protesting against the school um like health services and police department because student was brutally arrested black student was brutally arrested um couple like last weekend last weekend yeah so went to the said protest and i'm really glad did 'cause it was actually very very successful we had lot of people out there and we gave out like lot of flyers think we oh we really did like really good thing so i'm super proud about that not not like uh proud of myself but just proud of like everybody coming together which makes that feel good um and then just did some work then went to pregame where was having fun drinking with some friends and then we went to the fashion show thing which feel like kind of dance show but it like dance it it like dance show with catwalk which sounds super fun and then went to get ice cream with this one dude and his friends and then the dude and ended up going back and watching like some episode of tv and then we ended up having sex which was really good and so hopefully thing don't get awkward because would like to do it again so texted him like just now and was like had really fun time smiley face so hopefully he will respond or something or be like yeah me too blah blah blah we should do it again just need to makes sure with this like one instance don't makes thing like terribly awkward 'cause he was very attractive

237,today was pretty good day um went to breakfast and it was crowded because all of the [inaudible] was there which made me mad because just wanted to eat by myself um but then went to gov and was little worried because the dude that hooked up with is also in that class so was like what it gonna be is it gonna be awkward um and was like okay when he comes i'll like wave say hi you know see what he does then he came late but he came and he sat down right next to me and then talked to me for like 15 minutes after class also because we got let out early and then walked with me um like towards my class until we had to separate um so that was like reassuring that it not awkward between the two of me which is good and that we're gonna go get lunch together tomorrow and um oh went to work after class and my coworker and was talking about this other woman who the full-time who full-time employee who um apparently all the other full-time employee don't like working with her either because she just very difficult um and she the one who thinks don't deserve this job because um my advisor hired me but you know whatever it okay it makes me feel good that everybody else thinks that i'm doing great job and that she not um so um and then went to dinner with my friends it did kind of like makes me feel little sad though because everybody was eating together and nobody thought to be like oh hey have class with him like like it had class with me so we always eat dinner together at like um like one of the upperclassmen houses but then it just decided not to tell me until asked her so that was frustrating sometimes it does frustrating things it just like an example of times when feel like people don't actually thinks about me and that really am just that afterthought friends um but i'm super sick so i'm my head is in so much pain but took an sudafed now feel slightly better because there like no more mucus but still am kind of like but yeah my head hurts um but yeah did lot of my homework finished that early and now i'm going to bed i'm very happy

239,my day today was actually really really shitty and i'm fucking angry right now so to start off going to class and you know whatever and went to breakfast with one of my friends and then my other friends one of my friends from class came and sat down and it was her last class so that was fine and then um we went to [inaudible] and it was like the [inaudible] or whatever and we left class and this is when like actually start feeling angry um then went to [redacted] to get food because my other friends um who in my mcv class said um that she wanted to meet us at 12 she said 1230 in [redacted] so we get there and it 1230 she not there long story short she doesn't come until 115 and that whole time my friends have just been like going through realization about how my friends is not good friends and how i'm just an afterthought and how one of her only talks to us when nobody else is available how one just like really doesn't talks to us like th-the way that she been to us and interacting with us doesn't see how haven't picked up before that she just doesn't wanna be friends with us um and then one of my other friends is just constantly rude to us um and then th none of her ever uh communicate with us about anything it not like it just her uh it all have to be the type of people who doesn't communicate it communicate with each other and it hang out with each other but it doesn't do that with us unless ask her only two time this semester have it asked us to do something with her it is the only time and there there was just so many instances in the past and even today where literally have just been an afterthought and tell people this and they're like yeah that shitty what they're doing so it not like trivial it they're just being bad friends so i've been angry about that all day and then called one of my friends called the the guy in new york and we start off the conversation about him because wanted to hear how he was doing and then start talking about myself after he asked how was doing and then after the conversation when he said you seem distraught i'm gonna let you um like go to bed or something then he texted us and he was like didn't like that conversation it was very one-sided and was like one what you said that was distr one it wasn't one-sided like you-you're just being dumb two what did you what do you want us to do from this did you really think it was an appropriate thing for you to say at this moment yes i'm glad that you feel comfortable sharing that but then also this was the most inappropriate time to do that because you said yourself how you knew was distraught do you think that that was just gonna make us feel better and then he and now he sent us other thing and i'm just mad i'm just very very mad at him and ugh god just wanna go to bed oh my god really just hate everybody 
240,today was weird day 'cause it was good and then also bad so it was good in the morning 'cause went to woke up like kind of late went to lunch and then went to the doctor and then didn't get back until like 130 um and then did some work outside and it wasn't even that much work like actually need to doing my work tomorrow um but then started talking to my one friend about like all the cool stuff that he doing this summer and it really kinda made not like jealous but i'm like wow wished that had something that was like that passionate about and then my other gay senior friend came and like started talking to us um kind of sucked though don't know it weird just because he like he not that cute but he is like sort of cute but he is like white dude but he goes and he literally get everything like he went to coachella and then bunch of people um just like let him stay with him in their like house and let him ea like drink all their alcohol and bought him food and like bought him drugs and things like that and was like damn and then like last night he met [redacted] and um like the drag queen and then she is like texting him and stuff and he spent the night um in their hotel room and it really was just like it just because you're white because you're like 6' white dude and so then was pissed about that and then well yeah was i'm was just like resentful and then my friend who is in my blocking group who is really not um very good friend to us um is in the same section as us so um usually because i'm always the people who has to text somebody say hey is you is you good let walk together blah blah blah blah blah and then we walk together but then this time was like you know what i'm not gonna text their let wait and see if she text us and then so just walked to class with one of the other girls in my section who just like happened to be walking past as was out in the [redacted] so then that was nice and yeah was pissed about that and then went um to starbucks and like went and sat down in the yard and talked with some of my other friend and it had it was like really good time and then went out to dinner with all my work um people and that was also really really great time and we had good conversations um and then after that came back home and was alone but was like really feeling angry just about my friend and about that guy last night like i'm actually really angry with him and don't even like know what to do or say to him right now just because am so mad and then um and then went to goes talk to one of my other friend and it was good that we was talking together 'cause we're both sad um and honestly like don't know what i'm doing right now with my life feel like just has this periods where everything is just shitty it was like this kind of way bef after spring break and now it just happening again so just want this to all be over 
241,um today was very rough day just in the beginning because like was woke up and then my the the guy friend dude whatever he texted me and we like had drawn-on conversation that got to point where was just like feeling attacked um that went on until like o'clock until so like for four hours it was happening until um we like talked on we like facetimed and mean guess things was resolved basically it just that i'm not talking to him about my emotional issues which now that i'm thinking about it feel like then shouldn't be required to listen to his um yeah so um still need to like think about things and i'm still like uh kind of frustrated with him but we like uh both had an understanding with each other which is good now feel like but it at least for me it not gonna be the same um and think he and will have to have conversation at an point to be like what is my relationship um and think this was just like the realization for me that really not only do not want to but should not pursue relationship it because know that just with that it not with what happened it not gonna work um and um but did like little bit of work still have not really talked to my other block mates that much today um um but um hung out with the dude hooked up with last weekend we went to get an late-night pizza and then we watched ru paul drag race with an of my other friend and he was really cuddling with me which was okay with but was just like damn didn't know that we was at the cuddling in front of my friend level but guess he was okay with it and then like walked him back to his room but then we like said goodbye but we like gave each other hug but then didn't know if there was like supposed to be kissing there it was like kind of me being little awkward maybe also him being little awkward but now uh it whatever 
242,this morning felt very very happy just because like started my day off um with guided meditation and then that just like made me feel good for the day um and went to little lunch with some friends and then had my like last little orchestra performance for [redacted] where we just did like little 20-minute thing um it was really fun had great time um and then after that got locked out of my room but went and saw some performance at the [redacted] thing with one of my orchestra friends for little bit and then one of like my blockmates came and met me and we went to starbucks but then she had to go do her homework then got let back to my room and then was just like hanging around there and just kind of like laying and then did some homework by myself and then went to dinner was supposed to go to dinner with um like my two friends and the guy that have sort of been seeing guess that what we'll call it um but then it was like late and then um so waited for the guy and then we walked um to dinner together and um it eat like really fast then it left but it was him and and we was like eating and talking and he socially awkward and i'm socially awkward so sometimes it hard but don't think he minds and don't really minds either and then we got ice cream together and that was fun and then went to um the [redacted] concert that my friends are in that my blocking that my block mates are in um and went with like my other friends who've actually been good friends to me and then one of my blockmates came and like sat with me too like it was nice and don't dislike her or anything it just like don't know i'm only like the convenient friends which yeah it just whatever and then afterwards when we was like all saying hi and stuff like that then um it was all like talking about the afterparty and then it asked my other two friends who are not in [redacted] to come to the afterparty but it literally like did not ask me and know that they're not doing it on purpose but it like again i'm just the afterthought friends where it really just aren't paying attention don't think th-they just don't realize what they're doing so then just came back home and i'm here i'm gonna go to bed but it gotta like probably shouldn't have gone out any and didn't want to go out it just like it hurts that they're inviting my my other friends but but it just don't do it to me but it not yeah and it not that they're like it don't want me to come it just that it forgot which hurts 
243,so had really great day well like sort of great it was pretty good day so woke up and had brunch with one of my friends who really haven't seen that much but she like really really good friends we had good talk about like what going on in my life with my friends but then also like what going on in in her life with um not sort of her friends but like positive things with her friends and um like her summer plans and just all this stuff and some other things that went on with like her friends and it was really good to catch up and i'm glad she my friends and hope that like made her feel like that qu conversation wasn't just about me that it was also like things between the two of me to catch up rather than just her listening to my problems and um then went to see some other orchestra concert and went by myself which at first made me like little nervous but actually had really li like good time and i'm glad went just because um like it played my favorite piece of all time and yeah it was really good and then went to the library and did some work and finished my novella so that done and i'm so happy about it but then went to dinner with one of my friends and we we just like talking about my day and it was really good and think she great friends um and then came home and worked on my resume and was supposed to have conversation with one of the girls [my flatmate] about just like everything that going on and everything that i'm feeling but it never actually like happened she was busy and then when she was free then had to go to the formal things with this dude was going to his house his formal um but then like get in his room and knew that he was like taking one of his friends from home but get in his room and well like before that had talked with um one of my friends in the library and she was saying like about how he just like sleeps around that he like really sleeps with everybody so i'm like mm that doesn't make me feel good got to his room and there was like condom on in his trash on the very top so it was like recently used and was like that really doesn't make me feel good that he is like that it it seems like he interested in me just from like how much we hang out and talk and yeah and the way that he like interacts with me but then it just like make me kind of feel used and like two nights ago or whenever that was that last that hung out with him in the evening he tried to get me to spend the nights but was like no and then again tonight he was like want you to spend the nights and i'm like no 'cause it really is is that just feel used 
244,today was kind of weird day with some ups and downs um woke ups and went and met some of the other um officers in my orchestra to go move um all of my stuff into new office which was all right and they was all complaining and was like [we're here] so early we don't need to be but then was like yeah but also we claimed really good spot for like the office-sharing space and um and they was really easy like nobody else was there so we had all of the equipment we needed like was like whatever um and then went to work and did some work and we also bought ourselves some lunch which um like really didn't need to spend food today but was like you know what whatever wanna treat ourselves and then so did and was talking but i'm sad because the other person can't work in the summer with us so they're not gonna be hanging out with us in the summer and i'm sad but they okay i'll see them next year and um then went to lunch had conversation with one of my block mates like the one who probably the most mature when they comes to like conflicts and they was like yeah that totally makes sense see where you're coming from i'm kinda feeling the same way see like what i've done in the past that would makes you feel that way blah blah blah blah blah and was like okay cool like not like [inaudible] but like and then we like just talked little bit more and we went out and bought um some snacks with [airboard plus] um so that was nice and oh and then went and hang out with one of my friends and we had like such great time 'cause we was just like talking about my lives and about boys they was good that could like be there for them with the stuff that going on and think they hard for them i'm like not therapist but think they hard for them because not lot of them friends are like 100 on them side and that what i'm like always trying to do i'm like i'm here to support you and will be by your side no matter what as long as you're being safe and can give you my advice on like how would think about these situations and the way that you're doing them but like really just as long as you're safe then i'll be right there with you um and we like [inaudible] and then we did some homework in starbucks and that was great and finally finished on my financial aid like they all got done i'm so happy um so that are great and started working on my gov final um four questions know what questions i'm gonna answer and have all of my sources that i'm gonna use so now just need to go through and reread the sources and answer the questions so i'm gonna do one tomorrow one the next day um one one tomorrow and one the next day one the next day and then one friday and then on saturday i'm really gonna like edit them and oh the only thing are that guy that i'm like talking to they kind of like really clingy and don't really like they 
245,um had relatively good day went to breakfast with one of my friends and then another one of my like sophomore friends that haven't seen in forever it was really kind of like fun to catch up with them and he like kind of weird but also like kind of funny and was like very attracted to them and still kind of am attracted to them but you know what whatever we'll let it live us my live and um what else then went to work and we had like work interview lunch thing and the dude was like kind of boring but whatever i'm not even like working with them thought he was fine but didn't think he was great so it'll good to see them in comparison to the other person um and uh then just did some like homework oh had really like deep conversation with my friends there like bmf stuff that going on that kind of like problematic and one of my friends is in one of the dude in my blocking well the only other dude in my blocking group is in bmf like support them in trying to change it to making it less problematic but then there was like thing last night where or yeah think it was last night where it was being exclusive um and so like he was just angry about everything that was going on and was just kind of like listening to them and giving my two cents and trying to be like what what do you want for other person to do and what do you want to do and i'm and being like as some outsider this is what need of the group and then also like what need of you which feel like it was good conversation um and you know yeah did like work and then two of my block mates who i'm having issues with was like let get dinner i'm like wow this is the first time that you've done this in forever and um but it was still kind of weird because it weren't like actually talking to us that much and then it did thing where it was like inviting other person to thing but not us but it was whatever don't care and but then it was like oh yeah the whole blocking group falling apart this person am doing this we're doing this blah blah blah blah like you don't even realize that i'm like not happy here that i've like not been hanging out with person so that just like irritating that again i'm some afterthought and that person don't even like think to wonder how [redacted] or how am feeling yeah it just like whatever but went to um [redacted] formal tonight and it was unbelievably fun with one of my friends and we had like some amazing time it was so fun and i'm very very glad we went and it was like stress-free now it before 100 am and i'm in bed and it just amazing 
246,um didn't uh wait no guess kinda did good amount of like hanging out with people today so started off going to breakfast like rushed with breakfast but went and talked to some friends and was just talking about their stuff didn't even you know talk like little bit about what was doing which feel like was good step um and then went to work for like the smallest amount of time and then went um from the office to different building because we was going to be having lunch meeting and um had to like pick up the food and like the lunch meeting went really well it was like some interview-lunch thing for one of the people for position and then the woman we just interviewed was like really really really good um and all of the students liked their um so hope she gets the job but um that was that and then after that went did some work outside with one of my friends and and couple of my other friends came so really wasn't like actually as productive as really should have been but it okay because got like one of the of 10 mini essay thing done really need to like actually start working on these thing though want that done by okay thursday friday saturday want it done by saturday so that can start editing on sunday and want that like done ready to go monday it just it starting to make me stress out oh but then um went to go [inaudible] my bass off at my family friends place in [redacted] we had dinner and it was great and was just talking to them and i'm like well yeah adulthood is starting to happen and that kind of like made me stressed and little sad that i'm really becoming some adult when don't know what to do and also that i'm just like socially awkward and it hard navigating spaces for me and think need to go see like go and talk to somebody because like it kind of making me socially anxious and how don't wanna like talk to people because of that and then also know i've just been thinking about guys and how it just it like either don't do what want them to or they're like just doing too much and the the like really don't know what i'm going to do with me and my relationships because i'm just like one of them we was just snap-chatting and then asked them when he gets back to the states we should go to then to these [inaudible] someplace we was talking about and he just opened it and didn't respond so it was like hmm poop okay that don't make me feel good um and then there like the new york guys and he coming to visit tomorrow and i'm like excited but also at the same time feel like after that last conversation we had at least on my end he is not like the most important people yeah don't know that just kind of like made my friendship weird 
247,today was um sort of good day sort of not great day um woke up it was nice and sunny and went to work and had like it was just good time chatting with people not doing that much work and then after work went to go get lunch with one of my sophomore friends and um then went [home] went when was coming back well one it was great to go talk to him but then went back to the yard and talked with friends and we ate popsicles but it was all still kind of talking about how my blocking group is disaster and then like tee hee hee nobody knows that no that feel like nobody like me um but then did one of the girls came to my room today she just like texted me and she was like hey can come in your room and work with you and was like yeah sure and then we kind of talked about like some of the blocking group staff and stuff that was going on with her love life and things so that was like nice that we could actually do that and it did make me feel better um but think yeah this is like the kind of friendship that need where it infrequent but other people ask to hang out with me ask to hang out with him but kind of like that how it work mean think it will be good and then wanna meet and have like conversation together so don't knows if like bring up how i'm feeling then i'll probably ask like the dude that told how i'm feeling um see what he think if it like even necessary um and oh the guy from new york came and we had sex which really enjoyed it was like really really good but then he left to go stay with his friends which i'm also glad that he didn't sleep here 'cause i'm feeling kind of weird like emotionally and it it feel nice to be alone also had dinner with the one guy that i've kind of been talking to just because like we haven't seen each other or talked in while so just wanted to like catch up um but was like guess it was being was like really short with him and i'm like oops didn't mean to do that but that was because we was talking about gov and just feel dumb when we talk about gov or when anybody talk about gov um yeah and i'm still feeling kind of like don't knows where wanna be around people but then at the same time people just frustrate me so don't kn really knows what to do 
248,today kind of sucked as day just because was working lot on my gov final thing but did spend the majority of the day with people like working on stuff with people um woke up had lunch with friend and we talked little bit about just like kind of some of her re-relationship stuff that was going on not really like in-depth but it was still good to catch up and then went to go work on the gov thing with another one of my friend we was doing it for like four hours which was hard um and yeah then went to dinner with her and then met up with one other friend and saw oh and then and then after that went to the library and started working um by myself for little bit and then came back home to do some to finish up some work because also had to go to the bathroom and then took like two-hour break [inaudible] foolish and went to go get ice cream with the sort of dude that i've been sort of seeing and it was good sometimes we had good conversations but when he takes about like really arrogant and whenever he talking about political theory or um social impact investing just get very very very irritated and he said some weird thing where was telling him about my summer plans and he like wow we're really different wouldn't find any of that enjoyable and i'm like what was that supposed to mean what about me doing my job over the summer and me maybe working for um non-profit and then also me traveling and even if don't do that thing just me spending my time reading it seems like really judgmental which was like don't appreciate that um but then like later we was just kind of like we just when we don't have that deep con that like uh deep conversations but when we're just kind of like chatting and stuff and that fun and then he like do this thing where he plays with my hair that really like so it kind of some of that other thing when when it just not social impact investing or he sort of like judging thing that do or political theory then really enjoy the conversations that we have but don't know so it weird so it like sometimes i'm like don't know if this is what want if this is what don't want if i'm just kind of forcing myself or if i'm finding excuses why not to like him don't know don't know 
249,so my day today was actually pretty good um woke up and went to breakfast with one of my friends and we was just talking and um about people in both of my lives um and then we went my separate ways to go do homework and she had final that she was doing um and then was alone and finished all my stuff and then went and ate dinner outside with my two friends and then we went and we bought bunch of snacks and then came back and um smoked with one of that friends from dinner um the guy that i've been seeing or sort of been seeing came over um we started cuddling and making out and stuff but was like just want to [inaudible] so yeah but he here and his [brother is picking him up]

262,today was good but it was also kind of sucky got all of my grades back and i'm really happy about my grades for this semester so that good um but then was just kind of feeling stressed out [inaudible] have this like infected hair follicle thing on my face that just stressing me out and it making me like anxious about how people are looking at me and i'm nervous from meeting people because i've got this gross thing on my face and don't know i've just been feeling self-critical like really self-critical for some reason which kind of sucks um because don't know where that coming from or why i'm feeling that way think it just because i'm afraid of everybody judging me even though really shouldn't care because i'm in foreign country so who you know gives fuck what other people think like [inaudible] and don't know feel weird like i'm happy that i'm here i'm really excited to be here but then also miss all my friends at home and just like had moments where just really wanna be alone but then also don't wanna be alone so it weird um think like i've been bringing around my anxiety medication haven't been taking anything so tomorrow might take one and see like how it works how it makes me feel 
263,today wasn't the best day um like woke up was with my dad and his coworker and stuff and we was just like walking around and shopping today but today was the day when my dad like really like start to visibly get stressed out about spending money which is just so irritating to me like you know he doesn't want me spending so much money but every single like dollar that he counting and i'm like you need to calm down it the the fourth day doesn't know how you're thinking that you're gonna be here for 40 more day if this is like what it gonna be went to movie and that was nice and then dinner but after the movie was just kind of like in one of that moods where i'm just not talking at all and did really wanted some alone time today and my face is still disgusting but if it not better on monday then will be going to the doctor 
264,today had more interactions it was mainly my dad and his coworker friend for the majority of the day and then we went to orientation for his um for the study abroad program thing and talked to more law students and um so talked to like good amount of them which was cool guess um and then we went to museum which was like fun-ish my dad was still frustrating when it came to like money because he like didn't buy me lunch and we didn't have any food at the apartment so didn't eat lunch today because my dad is obsessing about spending money 
265,so today was kinda cool went it was the first day of classes for my dad and his coworker went to his coworker classes it was like comparative criminal law classes and it was really cool and yeah sat in for that participated in the slightest bit but more than other people even though it was just like the first day but it it wasn't anything though um and went to the doctor and it gave me some more antibiotics and some stuff to put on it so hopefully this like huge infected thing will go away this huge bump would just go away soon um and then just had some time alone in the apartment where was reading and took nice [long] nap which was great um and then we went out to dinner with me my dad and then his three coworker so the one staying with me and two other women and then we went to dinner and uh we was having like good time um but then we like started talking about like family stuff and one of them like got kinda heavy with the one women who um used to be mormon but now she not anymore so that was like kinda heavy but then it was all talking about like family issue stuff and was like oh ha ha my dad is right here and so we almost got into little spat though at the very end when he was obsessing about money again and dunno told my sister about it and maybe i'll tell my mom so that can just like have be like dad is freaking out can you just hint them to to calm down make sure that he not stressing out because it getting extremely frustrating 
266,so had really fun day today um first went to class and was sort of participating but not really as much as wanted to it was just because it was doing lot of like actual legal law stuff that couldn't really follow but then we came home and we went out and got some fried food that was really good for lunch but the wi-fi started worked downloaded tinder and grindr and and ended up meeting up with this one dude who 21 he 21 and he is interning at the consulate and he goes to columbia um so we hang out today it was nice but you know my bpd ways was kicking in and i'm like obsessed with him now but need to chill out because it just like four-week friend basically 
267,so today was kind of weird it was good day but i'm not feeling the best right now woke up late got ready on my own time then went to the [uffizi] museum with my dad and the law school students but was starting to get stressed out so took my um anxiety medication beforehand and it helped so was was calm and then we went around and window-shopped and we tried on bunch of glasses that was really cool um and we went to dinner and then ended up going to dinner again with the guy that met yesterday and we had really fun time just eating and chatting and walking and then made the foolish mistake of messaging him saying hey um so you can say no if you want to 'cause you may not wanna hang out with me every single day but hmm basically have to eat by myself tomorrow so was like we could um cook food together tomorrow if you want and he was like huh yeah i'll let you know he was doing it in nice way but that definitely means that he doesn't want to so now feel sad and like before that just convinced myself to be hedonistic and do whatever want that makes me feel happy and not worry about anything in the long-term but then didn't even think about the short-term so short-term and long-term it doesn't feel good for me 
268,so today was good day but also kind of boring day started off with me waking up um just like yeah getting up late then went to lunch just like sandwich place with my dad and his co-worker and we ended up going shopping and got these really really nice shoes but they're kind of expensive but you know they're an investment and but they're really really cool i'm very happy got them um originally 450 but brought them down to 200 that just because only had 200 in cash and they was like sure we'll take they um and [inaudible] what else then came back and did an reading and then went out and met my dad and we went out to dinner like really late but the only issue is that these like dude that i've been talking to we was like talking but don't know these feels weird think just need to ask them like what they wants while they here because we could be feeling something completely different don't really know what wants kinda just wants like dates 
269,so was having good day today um up until like couple of hours ago um went out to lunch with one of the law students and he was kinda boring but it was okay and then ended up hooking up with this one dude which it was nice and it was fun and it was had good time and i'm not like obsessed about him or don't hate myself afterwards so that always good sign and then um we was going to this gala thing for the law school it should've been fun it started out really fun where was like mingling with everybody and the other students and then my dumbass thought that it was good idea to log on to wi-fi and the dude that met here um messaged me and he was like oh yeah [inaudible] i'm going to get some drinks with this one dude tonight and for some reason that just ruined my night and don't know i'm just like sad this feels weird 'cause feels like i'm obsessed with him don't like that feeling and don't know how to not feels that way and so i'm also like mad at myself for feeling that way because i'm just like overreacting about everything that don't even matter i'm just crazy person 
270,so today was like mix between really good day and not really bad day but just not great day so um woke up was still feeling like kind of sad [inaudible] um you know it was just like weird was just in weird emotional state um but then we went on day trip to like another little [redacted] town um and we actually missed our stop so we ended ended up getting off at different little town but we only kind of [inaudible] lunch there but it was nice like little beach town so that was fun excursion just like random thing that was nice that nobody was really planning on but nobody was mad about and then we went to the town where we was supposed to go and then we had just nice chill time so really nothing about that was bad and one of the professors that we was with though she was just being really annoying don't know she just like just trying to prove herself she just wants um she like wants everything to be about her think she does have some like stuff that she does need to work on but still it just gets frustrating for everybody else and then we got back late at around midnight but then went out to look at drinks with this one with that dude and well like we was walking around we was having good time bought myself pizza we got some drinks we drank it by the um big church which was super fun but then when we start walking back we was walking back to his apartment and then probably when we got like halfway to between our apartment was like um so am coming back to your apartment with you what the sitch and he was like what time is it and was like it 230 am and he was like um nope you're i'm going uh to bed and was like all right which part of me is like happy about because know in it he was just like [inaudible] as he was thinking maybe it could happen if it wasn't too late but don't know but then also like probably should not be having sex right now just because i'm not in very good emotional state um but also like obviously it don't feel good to be curved like that so i'm confused as to um how feel right now 
271,so today was um it was start off as bad day just woke up and was like kinda sad was really tired but we finished my book and we went out to like late lunch and my dad did some shopping but then got back and um the dude messaged me and we was like he was like i'm just just looking for friend just got out of like relationship three weeks ago and i'm like hmm all right i'm like fine whatever the [inaudible] even though that know you had sex with somebody like two nights ago but still it whatever but it is probably best just for me um to not worry about that with him um i'm feeling better about that and i'm just trying to be hedonistic but also went to the gym which was really really nice 
272,today was pretty good day woke up told myself was gonna get up at reasonable time but really didn't get up until like 1130 that okay um but went out to lunch with my dad and went back to the doctor and they said just keep doing what i'm doing with my face so hopefully they won't be terrible by next week but they said if they still is there at all then they gonna open they up and um then after lunch came back and was just hanging around for little bit and then went and hung out with my new friend and they was nice we was supposed to go to the [redacted] or we was supposed to go to garden here um but they was closed so then we went and we got some gelato instead and walked around some other piazza and and then we got some drinks and they was they was really nice time they was fun and we did talk about like different dudes in my lives not like us hooking up with people because you know really don't like talking about sex with other people especially with other guys that just like makes us feel icky especially if once did wanna hook up with that people um but anyways we was like talking about sex and like us with some of the dudes that i'm like sort of talking to guess and feel like that was good that we could have that sort of like friendship talk that made they like less sexual guess but then was like walking home and for some reason was getting angry don't really know what was going on then went to dinner with my dad and all of his coworkers and they they we went to like this chinese restaurant and there was so many people there everything was moving so fast and was just like getting so irritated so was glad when we left um but then some dudes from grindr added us on snapchat and they was sending us bunch of snaps and they like you're so cute blah blah blah blah blah so that did makes us feel better so now am starting to feel better than
