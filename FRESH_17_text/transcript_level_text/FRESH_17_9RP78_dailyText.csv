18,so today has been fun day it been very eventful woke up today fairly late like around 900 had an interview slash informal meeting with one of my professors had lot of fun during that uh he one of my acting professors and he absolutely just fantastic he he gem he makes anyone feel comfortable uh and don't know if every professors makes their students feel like that but he genuinely just gives off this vibe of being comfortable and being happy and it something very nice to has hang out hung out with lot of friends today we saw an shows we just hung out had good time and don't know just feel little bit disconnected like was kind of like an outsider looking in um and know that it mean well and know that they're my friends and all it just don't feel as connected as want to be and you know the people like me and stuff and you know it always talk about how great and funny am and stuff and they're really kind and nice but it just it feel don't know it don't feel like belong not necessarily that don't belong or that am an outcast or whatever but it it just feel like i'm step behind where should and it kind of frustrating but they're my group of friends they're absolutely fantastic it am wonderful and nice and funny and kind and don't know they're blessings beyond my imagination so came back to my dorm later that night um was really hungry so we went to go get [redacted] it was nice restaurant um we bought an chips was still little bit hungry and mainly just wanted an grub kind of to you know an junk food to get me away from the whole feeling little bit disconnected and stuff called my family today it was nice um it was nice just to hear their voice and hear their plans and stuff and hearing how it plans on living their life and it was nice um and they're sending my computer up which i'm super super super excited for it has my video games it has my theater pieces it has lot of my work and it just makes me happy to know that it coming up here so that really what i'm looking forward to all right well thank you phone for recording me good night goodbye 
19,it has been great day um went to church early in the morning realized need to reestablish some of my priorities uh reestablish my life kind of in way really need to guess kinda get my life in order not necessarily like completely and to the tee but just has that sense of diligently seeking what is right and uh was pretty happy about that um today uh was kind of annoyed because the church is uh 53-minute ride think and it it was nice church not really one that will probably go to um consecutively i'll probably go to different church uh it it was great and all but it just wasn't for me i'm looking for something maybe little bit different that being said had good time it was nice to be in church setting again called my friend really missed him haven't talked to him in really long time so hearing him and me kind of like giving out spiel on how i've been feeling recently about uh you know feeling extremely happy but also to some extent lonely simply because uh i'm in new environment i'm in place that haven't been to you know i'm experiencing new things new emotions and it just feels different and for me consider myself as strong individual that is able to overcome anything but it still was extremely different to be in that situation of just newness so uh know last night was kind of little bit down kind of really really really tired went to i've been sleeping little bit less uh and whenever throughout the day feels fine like feels great feels compelled to do things and i'm ready to do work and everything else but once it get to nighttime get extremely tired um so i'm gonna see if can kind of fix that up bit try not going to sleep so late know one of these night these week went to sleep like around 500 and uh that was really late we was watching movie um so tonight i've just been doing homework i've been doing lot of homework today lot of reading been very productive it nice to see that uh i'm doing great i'm very happy love these college love my room love it all and genuinely am doing good and it nice to know that it feels like has place here feels like belong know that belong and though at time it might not feels that way know that do so that my audio log for today am currently doing laundry and i'm gonna get back to doing homework night 
20,so today was very interesting day because today went to class uh enjoyed my class enjoyed math so that was an awesome thing afterwards came to my room read for bit just relaxed and then went to lunch actually right before went to lunch my friend came in who is almost like my third unofficial roommate and brought in water jug which we have been looking for for so long and him bringing it in we fold it up we installed it and it felt so awesome we was so excited it so nice to have water in my room it the little thing that love uh went to go get lunch after lunch helped my friend take printer to her dorm and then went back to my dorm and chilled for bit and read for bit and then my friend asked me to help her and her roommate move couch up to her floor and so helped him do that um and maybe it southern hospitality but enjoy helping other people out and it was really nice to see her expressions of just like in awe that somebody helped him carry couch so far from the mail room to her dorm up up an stairs and help him install it um we had lot of laughs and it was just nice to connect with people like that it offered to buy me food asked for red bull and it said that thing will kill you [laughter] so we'll get you something else which think was really sweet of him and kind of unnecessary didn't did it because wanted to not because you know was looking for kind of reward but it was nice and it it have an funny photos which have now of me carrying it and installing it so it was pretty great uh after that we had meeting with my entryway it was uh something that feel like we should have had during pre-orientation so was kind of distracted throughout but was still you know trying to be engaged trying to be interactive because know that it was an important issue uh afterwards did an homework did an reading uh ate an orange which was really good it was really good orange it didn't have seeds and that was awesome because seeds is very pestering especially whenever you take big bite into an orange slice and you find seeds in the middle it just kind of disappointing you know 'cause then you gotta take time to like spit out the seeds and you know all that stuff um like mentioned and guess that my theme for this audio log is th love the little thing absolutely do they're great they're wonderful and think people forget how awesome it is all right cool night 
21,so today was interesting today was really busy you like like all my tuesdays all my tuesdays are very busy they're they're very like back to back to back to back to back and um normally that not problem after class ate with some friends had good time just got to chill and relax around 420 got text that close family friends had passed away today and it doesn't feel real it feel like joke uh uh or not really joke but it feel fake it feel surreal like it guess it because i'm not home and this are one of the very few time that i've actually called my hometown home since i've been here at college after hearing that and after calling my mom to make sure that it was true and stuff to really hear the voice went outside and took walk didn't cry wasn't super down remember just stood in front of the yard and just stayed for bit had cup of tea with me or or mug and just walked just kept walking and would just make random turns just kept walking there wasn't much that was on my mind though just kept walking kept spilling some tea and it didn't really bug me uh just kept walking haven't really told anybody um didn't feel like there was need to doesn't know i'm just kind of the kind of person that if have problem usually like to keep it to myself not necessarily because find it as sign of weakness but just because uh it how like to be so ate dinner with friends had good time you know was laughing and joking and but it felt like was step behind went back did some homework and uh hung out with my friends uh girl that i'm interested in doesn't think she interested in me but that okay so we ate popcorn and watched game of thrones and it was nice little thing it was nice little experience just to like you know sit down with good friends and just chill it was nice it was kind of like nice little turning off the brain and now i'm about to go do some more homework maybe go get like midnight snack later on uh but that my plans for tonight it really just to do homework and do some reading and get ahead in class i'm overall still really happy even though you know there was death of loved one but you know what can you do it'll be alright thing will always be alright believe that

23,today was fun day today ate breakfast with uh some of my friends from the pre-orientation program after that went to two classes felt really interactive during that classes um especially my second one didn't talk as much during the discussion but just felt more interactive think it because did more of the reading that felt more kind of involved and and enjoyed that like was able to give things more of my attention notes just came easier and guess just coming in with the mindset of did my work i'm prepared feel good you know and so it gave me that like confidence as went in after that ate lunch with my roommates which was nice we had good time we laughed um ate little bit more sweets throughout the day than would have liked after lunch took nap here in my dorm and then went to one of the labs and sat down on computer and said i'm gonna do as much work as can went through quite bit of work did uh some emails and stuff was pretty productive and it felt good uh but felt like it took me longer than would have liked um and once got done like around 600 me and my roommates we went and we went to go eat lunch or go eat dinner after that had rehearsal uh and about me eating felt good eating with them have been eating kind of healthy eat salads and one other entree but i've been eating little bit more than some entree and so need to watch that and i'm kinda cautious about that 'cause i'm starting to feel like uh more self-conscious about my weight uh but it also makes me excited because um if can get into this rhythm of this diet of one salads one small salads and one entree it will be discipline then i'll feel good in my life so i'm excited about that um had rehearsal today for one of my plays wasn't needed as much as some of the other uh but still got to have fun with them and felt little bit don't wanna say disconnected but slightly out of place might be the word because i'm i'm the only nonmusical part in the plays and so all need to do is just speak in rhythm and so came for about some hour more or less to rehearsal and though that was fun and got to interact with the cast little bit more there is some members of the cast that simply do not know uh more than their names and so because of that i'm looking forward to getting to know them more uh we're gonna have little get-together on saturday and so that something that i'm super super super hyped for uh just spending time with the cast getting to know them interacting with them really like interacting with people uh that being said had study break at with my entryway and afterwards hung out with some of the people from my entryway and it was really cool um we talked about lot of stuff and we got onto personal level at some moments and we laughed and it was nice it really was nice and look forward to doing that again hopefully sometime soon

34,uh today has been long tiring day and i'm super excited to go to sleep woke up to this morning at before 800 and went to go do postering for show we'll be publicize it and spent so much time waiting probably about 15 minutes waiting outside maybe little bit more waiting for everybody else to come so got there little bit early spent like around 20 minutes waiting don't know no big deal but was just extremely tired went to class today and had trouble focusing throughout and was just like oh but afterwards um took really long nap and felt prepared and ready for the day um went ate lunch with my roommates an we chilled um relaxed and really just had good time then we relaxed for bit um after that went to class my monday acting class which love love love love with all my heart because everybody in there we're all so close to each other and we're all very comfortable with each other and it was it was probably one of the most fun um class that we've had this week and i'm so excited for my up and coming assignments has show that we're gonna be doing in nine day i'm so hype for it i'm so tired i'm gonna go to sleep almost yeah yeah hmm it been fun day it been really like kinda like from one thing to the next and being excited for the next thing that are gonna come and that how i've uh been living my life recently so night 
35,and today theme is all about the little things because lot of my joy lot of my you know happiness and like hype from today came from the little things today so for example um slept little bit longer than should have pressed snooze on my alarm clock um but that little bit just made me feel so much better and rested felt good little bit stressed because was gonna be late for class but that little bit just made the day so worth it and um throughout class uh had really good time with my classmates 'cause would be interacting with them you know would say joke here or there or would make discussion we would talk for bit and it was that little moments that just was like i'm connecting with my class belong in this class like am making mark um and all that and it felt so good in my religion class we had little tea time before where we just drank tea and that little moments just felt so relaxing like we felt so connected to each other we you know all had love for tea so we're all sitting there sipping on tea and it was so wonderful to see afterwards got met new friend um he in my religion class and we ate lunch together and we interacted with some of my other friend and you know we had good time and good laughs and he gave me 11 red bulls and it was the best part of today easily just 11 red bulls and was like oh my gosh this is so wonderful um to them it was small gesture but that small gesture meant so much to me because them and his roommates don't drink red bulls so it was just trying to get rid of it and was just the lucky person that that fell on um during rehearsal today you know we kept laughing and we kept working on the little things and it was just such wonderful time just to like sit down or not sit down but like get down to the core of my show and you know fix the little things laughs about the big things laughs about the little things laughs about the small gesture the subtle joke and and and just have great time and it was so just you know it really made me feel connected and we was all laughing about it later and um laughing about the joke and having great time with my rehearsal and it was such great time um afterwards uh came back to my dorm and interacted with um my friend that lives in one floor above me uh she had my cards against humanity so picked it up from that and it was small conversation but that small conversation was just so like genuinely good and it was genuinely fun um had lot of just like subtle small things that happened for example bought toothpaste today and couldn't be more excited and used it just now and it was so awesome and it feel so wonderful and i'm so excited and th-the little subtle things have just been making my day today so wonderful so that my day 
36,today was very busy day don't know don't know how i'm feeling i'm feeling little bit tired little bit disconnected little bit like i'm living too much in the moment and not necessarily by like enjoying the moment but just being in the moment today went to class and enjoyed it it was fine really enjoy my ta he or my tf he amazing he fantastic he loves what he does and it gets me hyped afterwards went to church to episcopalian church um for one of my class so was quite ahead in my studies like in my papers so that made me feel great uh was really feeling connected and religious and uh li-like was getting back to my roots and felt good but uh you know so kept interacting with people later throughout the day and interact with quite bit of people um just felt little bit disconnected um and during rehearsal you know was having fun but just felt little bit off which is fine you know didn't feel as disconnected in this first so felt you know interactive with everybody and we-we're all having great time in my second rehearsal felt awful couldn't does well in the dance was messing up with timing was messing with moves was messing up rhythmically don't know why i'm in musical if have no musical talent and that kept going through my mind and it was giving me some negative thoughts and negative vibes and so interacting with people was little bit harder at the end of it ha you know was just like why am doing that why am in musical was kinda beating myself up over it and just started walking along the river and kept walking and kept walking and would sit for bit and does some homework and then i'll walk does some homework walk does homework walk and just kept walking and then started running and just kept running kept walking and walking and walking and running and running to where was so far away from the college at this point and uh walked back walkedran and still don't know what i'm gonna does about the whole play and whether or not should stick to being in musical 'cause i'm the guy that known for doing anything and being confident and able to does so but just i'm not doing well in that and so need to find out what to does so that is my thoughts 
37,today was good day um woke up early to go to postering to putting to publicizing our show as uh we got there the person that is in charge of posters took too long and didn't get there on time and we all ended up going back so i'm gonna watch some netflix and just relax for bit before our first class our first class presented today me and our partner forgot that we was but it was nice surprise we did much better than thought would so was pretty happy about that um also after that went to our religion class which was really nice really chilled the problem was had not done all the reading for this class felt little bit behind also felt really tired and towards the end of the that um towards the end of that class started feeling just little bit gross don't know why like started feeling headache started just feeling out of it immediately after left and went to go eat lunch with our friends with some of our friends and we had good time uh some good laughs kinda catch up little bit then the key part of what happened today is that received package and our and another one of our friends helped me bring it up and uh uh got our parents sent our pc and it was in great condition the only problem was didn't remove the graphics card and didn't lock the cpu in but the cpu is fine thank god uh but the graphics card because it bouncing up and down um broke kind of-ish and that is 100 our fault not our parents' fault it did perfect um and not fedex fault either uh it also did great it was simply our fault um for not taking that part apart 'cause even looked at it and said this might be problem and then thought to myself nah it will be fine but it was problem so and should've known and should have prepared and should've at least prepared for the worst but didn't and so on the bright side do not need graphics card for right now i'll probably buy it for december um i'll buy 150 one super nice one uh so i'm actually excited for that because i'll get really nice one i'm not sure if mentioned this but our direct deposit came in and so i've been super excited just feeling comforted knowing that have good net in our financial situation um don't have bad financial situation just don't have job and don't wanna ask our family for money and so it nice to have our refund in uh throughout the rest of the day hung out with some friends went to rehearsal just really had fun time interacting with person um got mozzarella sticks and that was ph-phenomenal and so it been good day and i'm excited for tomorrow 'cause tomorrow is gonna be chill day so that our life

39,today was fun day it was really busy day but on different type of busy because did our [q to q] with one of our shows so was busy from noon to roughly about 640 at 640 kind of just wandered around because didn't have our key to our dorm which was kinda just like eh but was just was taking advantage of the walk basically came in took huge nap knocked out from 600 till 800 and then went to our next rehearsal at our next rehearsal um felt kind of out of it not necessarily because um had some [things on our mind or] because you know just was distracted or anything but mainly because i'm not very good at musicals and i've mentioned this on other audio logs um but i'm just so bad at musicals and rhythms and stuff was nervous was you know whenever had to go to rhythms just felt uncomfortable felt like wasn't able to do it um but anyway finished and just felt kind of out of it so afterwards walked went out for walk and just kept walking and walking and walking and then all of sudden was in [redacted] was in [redacted] and uh you know that was crazy to me that just kept walking eventually just kept walking didn't have some end goal just was like i'll get to place and i'll be like all right time to go back was walking and saw this man on the ground and there was group of people around him and the fire truck and everything fire truck and everything was around him cop had gun [inaudible] and it was all trying to help this man and was you know it it affected me greatly because this man was only couple years older than me and it kinda hit me kept walking though and it and it stayed in our mind though and wasn't sure what to make of it but it just stayed in our mind but kept walking and kept walking and eventually got to wendy and was super excited because got um lot of food for really cheap bought that walked back walked all the way back and just hang out with some friends playing video games and then eventually just hanging out in their dorm and everything else it was fun day learned lot everything from sad tragedies like the man that was in very bad shape to just hanging out with friends and enjoyed today it gave me lot to think about it gave me lot of just like reevaluation of our life and though am stressed about our shows coming up i'm grateful for what do have so that our audio logs for today little bit scattered but hey it late i'm tired good night 
40,it been good day uh feel exhausted feel sick don't feel great but it been good day um so the way that today has worked is that woke up early way earlier than should has had four hours of sleep but surprisingly felt really well um did my laundry did lot of work was relatively productive began memorizing my lines for one of the shows that i'm in went to rehearsal after eating with my roommate and rehearsal was great it was very fast-paced very high-energy very driven and felt good 'cause loved having that purpose felt great about having that but about two-thirds of the the rehearsal in started feeling exhausted started feeling sick started feeling bad after that uh immediately ran to my second rehearsal where was supposed to be off book and did majority of it off book probably like 90 of it but not entirely off book which kind of was disappointing to myself but gave my best and was satisfied with how did rehearsal and was having great time and everything with the people there this is when it kinda go bad 'cause afterwards was just kinda in my feel kinda just thinking thinking too much and get back and drink red bull really fast um at around 800 i'm doing homework i'm doing some stuff hanging out with some roommate and then all of sudden open another one and it 900 and i'm thinking to myself well already opened it started drinking it and i'm starting to feel really bad uh not really bad but like i've been feeling sick throughout the day and so it started to like kinda build the energy drink actually made me feel better though out for short amount of time felt better felt was really jittery and normally caffeine don't do anything to me so two energy drink in and i'm feeling jittery and i'm not happy with that because i'm not happy with how much drink how much did that all that uh know how unhealthy it is for my body 'cause i've been drinking lot of re energy drink every day 'cause somebody gave me 11 on tuesday my friend took and drank 10 of them by today and so i've been kind of worried about that recently like today was worried because felt the crash of the energy and was like oh do not feel good my stomach hurts my head hurts feel drained so went to get water and drank ridiculous amount of water to flush out my body right now i'm feeling better i'm about to go to sleep but tomorrow has to wake up at 800 so um i'm feeling weird feel tired and wanna go to sleep and just wanna rest um but i'll get rest later on guess but it gonna be good day and i'm very positive and i'm very happy it great all right night

53,it been good day did lot of stuff and lot of chill stuff um woke up kinda late and got some good rest um especially after going asleep pretty late last night um ate with some friends and had good time there went to the [redacted] comic shop nearby and uh we chilled and had fun there and just relaxed afterwards came back to the dorm relaxed with my roommate for bit then got ready to go to [redacted] to see the curious incident of the dog at night-time play with some other members of my class including um somebody that is phenomenal who is one of the closest friends that have here at [redacted] right now and she great and wonderful and don't know enjoy spending time with her after that um went to [stake] shack with uh some of these friends um and then after that we went to some cappella jam the entire day was have been absolutely fantastic and chill and though have lot of work um relaxing and nice to just chill and breathe and spend time with friends um after the cappella jam hung out with with friends or with friends that i'm interested in and i've talked about her in some of the other audio lo audio vlogs and um i'm very interested in her and she great she fun and funny and super nice and hung out with her for over some ho for about some hour in her dorm but um she have boyfriend so although enjoyed my time with her feel bad and guilty and like what was doing was not like afterwards was like oh man need to recognize the boundary and not cross it because that is not good state to be in and do not wanna put either her or me or anyone in that situation in bad situation so it was kind of moment of realization of need to establish priorities not just in significant other but in my life so there that uh came back played board games with my roommate for really long time um and air hockey and stuff and now tried memorizing some of my lines for run-through tomorrow and just couldn't so [laughter] i'm gonna go to sleep tomorrow i'm gonna wake up early and i'm gonna get to work and i'm feeling hyped about that so anyway that my plan that today all right good night

55,today has been good day uh somewhat productive to an extent um woke up feeling really tired felt really just drained to begin with uh had to go do postering early in the morning for our show [inaudible] which comes up this friday which is kind of nerve-wracking but really relieving because finally that something that get to cross off our list and hopefully i'll be able to catch up on lot of the things and work that i've missed and be more productive and try getting ahead of our classes because that really what want to do um hung out with our roommates um by the way whenever say roommates mean our actual roommates and our friend that stays over at our dorm lot um he is just friend and uh he stays and hangs out with us lot and he is basically our our third roommates and that kind of the joke so whenever say roommates mean like that uh so we're all very close to each other and that pretty great um ate with them took nap did work or memorized our scene for today and did it in classes in our acting classes it was super it was such fun classes really enjoyed it i'm trying not to overthink uh relationships and people and and uh whether or not uh am flirting enough to lead into relationships so i'm not i'm trying not to th overthink that things and i'm just going to uh chill push everything aside i'm not very stressful people so right now feel kind of little bit weird that i'm slightly stressed about work and about um parents coming and about the play and about uh friend and and all that and where fit in and all that um so kinda has the you know normally would go out for walk and just keep walking but today just didn't feel like it us and our roommates went and got ramen and it really did clear our mind just being don't know just sitting and eating and thinking it was nice experience don't know why but today i've been feeling didn't really feel super exhausted just felt little bit out of it until all of sudden guess like the real kicker was rehearsal today after us doing like extensive monologue and then all of sudden got to our dorm and then as the night went on just felt exhausted so i'm going to sleep now i'm so tired night

63,oh so i'm really really tired and kind of frustrated because of hiccups and the fact that i've trying to record this for the past um two minutes three minutes four minutes don't know i'm tired today was an overall good day the bad part of it really came from the amount of homework that had and tried getting through it at slower pace so that way can um try knocking out two birds with one stone by watching movie um that was trying to get monologue from and doing my math homework and preparing for my midterm and stuff but eventually it it kind of fell apart and was just doing work for really long time and kept getting distracted and have the hiccups and i'm super mad because of the hiccups um but the first half of today was absolutely fantastic was engaged in class was interacting felt good felt confident um uh and then got the um mexican blue truck that was out in the plaza today which was super excited for because i've been forward to this for so long and had cash and got it and enjoyed it so much it was so good and exactly worth every every cent that paid um after that chilled for bit and didn't really worried about work didn't really worry about work because knew would get it done um so kind of was doing it at really slow pace wish that would've changed my pace because really ended up just working to long time and getting frustrated getting tired ge feeling tired and um don't know didn't finish my math homework um to the best that could fell asleep for about 13 minutes and then um woke up whenever my roommate come in came in so decided cleaned everything up brushed my teeth got ready bed and was like i'm going to sleep am too frustrated oh my goodness i'm mad um to do that so think really i'm more frustrated at the fact i've been burping and hiccupping for so long now and it just going on my nerves and ended up taking an of it out on my homework and so that kind of sucked um anyway i'm ready to sleep night 
64,today has been great day interacted well in my math class i'm starting to interact more i'm starting to say hi more and stuff [laughter] and actually talk which is good because haven't done that recently don't know maybe it 'cause it morning class and just kinda still am waking up to where don't interact with people as much as normally do which is an interesting interesting thought but today did maybe i'm just getting more comfortable in my surrounding don't know after that went to the gym felt really good didn't work as hard as would've liked but was still satisfied um weigh two pounds less than the last time that weighed myself on october 20th part of that is because um well you has my audio logs didn't eat as much as should has last week and part of this is just eating healthier or exercising and etc so today ended up overeating and splurging which in hindsight not as good as should've been but tomorrow i'll be better tomorrow will eat um healthier and yeah did an more for my midterm um took really long nap again and think that that primarily because i've been going to sleep so late i'm going asleep earlier tonight so hopefully i'll be able to not take two-hour nap in the middle of the day and waste so much time that need for studying my midterm that coming up which i'm excited for feel nervous because feel like should've studied more but also feel prepared because it over things that i've done well at so i'm not too worried even though know should be but i'm not um working on the past paper exam noticed that the answers that got and the way that got them weren't completely right and if weren't sure would look at the solution and it was the route that would've taken but just was doubtful of myself so um i'm gonna go into the midterm with confidence and hopefully will do well um trying to think what else re-watched eternal sunshine of the spotless mind looking for another monologue didn't find any um has to find monologue for my freshman seminar and haven't found any uh think found one today whenever went to go see the play jogging which was super excited for know quite bit of people in there and um what ended up happening was that there was part that really liked um my professor asked me to play more vulnerable character which kinda got me little bit anxious but really excited because that something new that can do so i'm really excited for that and um this was vulnerable character so i'm gonna look into that i'm really excited feel happy feel really good um so there that anyway i'm running outa time i'm gonna go ahead and go to sleep and chill hasta manana

86,well happy thanksgiving it was pretty chill um being here was little bit different than what i'm used to and didn't realize it until excuse me excuse me um didn't realize how different it was until started seeing lot of snapchats and uh the photos of other people doing their thanksgiving dinner and it and kinda felt nostalgic little bit lonely because was just thinking about how thanksgiving normally goes in my family and it normally all of me gather at my house and we all eat and it kind of potluck but it mainly my mom cooking and um we eat we laugh we have good time play with my niece and nephew for very little time get along fine with them but i'm not close with them basically put on video games with them and then me and my cousin who one of my greatest friends we always head out around 600 and we goes black friday shopping today today was [a lot] [inaudible] and was just being nostalgic about that and was just thinking back to the i'm sure that like next year whenever stay i'll be used to it um but don't know this year kinda just screwed around um watched video stayed on my phone it was also my brother birthday so gave them call uh felt good felt happy but because of like re because remembered how used to spend thanksgiving kind of felt little bit lonely um but that was fine because at around 430 went over to my [inaudible] um house uh and we had little friendsgiving there with their friends and their other [inaudible] that stayed so there was only two of me that stayed but and it was fun it it it was nice just to chill and interact with somebody during thanksgiving uh we had some thanksgiving foods which was awesome we had um you know some of the basic one we had lot more side dishes than actual dishes like than the actual meal uh we didn't have turkey we didn't have ham which was fine um the casserole was phenomenal oh so good uh and that really made me happy just getting to interact with people and getting to you know uh have that kind of sense of home love it here love [redacted] and love everything that we do here and love just being here though felt lonely was so happy though had nostalgia was still happy and got to interact with lot of my friends from back home do text and snapchats so didn't feel completely alone but did feel that level of separation and i'm uh and just look forward to going back not because necessarily miss home but because miss the people so that been my day good night 
87,so today was pretty great day um it started off kind of ugh because of the fact that whenever woke up my arms was chafed and it was the worst i've ever had my body be chafed it was absolutely horrible and it hurt so bad and knew it was horrible because looked in the mirror and thought to myself oh that looks bad and so um was in lot of pain so went to cvs bought some skin protectant didn't really help as much as hoped it would or as other times had so was just like ugh but anyway went to black friday shopping because really needed to get computer and kind of was eyeing out uh nintendo switch but digress so bought bought laptop and it was on sale and it is some awesome laptop i've already used it today to do some work to uh start writing and all that so it was great purchase um took the bus to the mall by myself which surprisingly wasn't as lonely as expected it to be and uh it was the first times that i've like rode the bus by myself without like group or without like program or event and it was just interesting to be there find everybody else that was alone maybe it was because it was early in the morning um don't know but felt good after black friday ate fast food which was absolutely fantastic had some food that i've been missing for while so it felt great um what else what else came back didn't really do much today guess mainly because nobody else is here don't have classes kind of don't have homework and though should be studying maybe the break is giving me overconfidence and didn't do as much work as had liked to but still did quite bit of work so was kind of happy with that um i've just relaxed and i've been taking full advantage of my break which is great uh didn't really interact with anybody else except for one of my friends who found at dinner and didn't plan on sitting with her not because i'm not close to her because she some awesome person and love her and she great and she super fun and stuff but just because was like kind of wanna be alone and she reading book but there very little seed seats left so and so sat next to her and it was good interaction it was nice and uh just talked for bit and it was fun um what else yeah that about it i've done some reading today i've been on my laptop watched lot of youtube watched lot of netflix um talked to my parents or talked to my mom and texted lot of my friends from back home today um i'm really looking forward to just the business of college to be back and person to be back um i'm really looking forward to going home i'm really looking forward to classes again um feel good little bit lonely but good nonetheless so that how i'm feeling that my day and that four minutes oh bye

90,today was pretty good day uh wanna start with specific section because know can talk about um highs and lows or whatever so i'm gonna probably do highs and lows because i've never done that uh at least don't think so um so there was huge highs that had today and it was during class uh my freshman seminar uh and acting seminar it was phenomenal because everybody in there is so passionate and so talented and uh we saw six performances today it was two-hour class and everybody there was amazing and it was inspiring and it was amazing to see so much creativity and so much love for art and just don't know like it was it was almost like bonding experience getting to see them perform the way that it did and it was wonderful it it it was only for us and so it felt like there was an intimacy there don't know it just made us feel more united with them and then afterwards we ate dinner together like we usually do and that part was little bit more fantastic than usual it just felt like we was interacting more than we had had been in the past maybe that because we'd gotten close and uh we was talking about final get-together before the class ended or after the class ended etc whatever and um it it was just nice and wholesome and just wonderful to see uh my lows is that worked so much with my partner on scene that we have to present tomorrow and granted it done it i'm satisfied with it i'm happy i'm content but didn't do my religion homework and did do my religion discussion uh that was due at midnight and it 300 in the morning and i'm not i'm taking the [inaudible] like i'm going to do it tomorrow hopefully maybe pray don't know maybe i'll do it after class don't know all know is that i'm exhausted and wanna go to sleep and just have to take my losses and that don't know like that on one side of the day like my my highs of the day got really inspired and determined and ready to do work and stuff and ready to be creative and feeling united by creativity and then on the other hand was just exhausted and and you know because of my lows here felt not dismayed but like little bit shaken and little bit disappointed in myself not like lot but like little to where was just like man because felt like was in huge rush throughout the day and look at the that moments that had free and i'm just like man how how why didn't do stuff like why didn't be productive and it kind of sucks that whenever you're you get freedom for yourself you look at it and you're like why why why didn't you do work and it kind of sucks knowing that you have so much work and so little free time but don't know people have it worse than us and i'm just i'm still getting the hang of it all so hopefully um i'm not too hard on myself because know i'm i'm in that learning process and i'm doing fine in that class so uh don't at least think am don't know don't know oh well tomorrow will be new day tomorrow will be good day and i'm excited so that my day i'm gonna knock out i'm exhausted good night see you tomorrow 
91,today was pretty eventful day woke up little bit early to work on my final presentation final performance for one of my acting classes with my partner so was kind of annoyed that we had to wake up early for scene that believe we we would be fine in um though rehearsal would have been good um we did well with my scene it was well received not as well received as others but it okay considered it success people laughed people had good time and that success in my book and that made me feel happy knowing that we started off and people wou like when we showed my original script people was not liking it and that kind of got me that kinda got me little bit don't know dishearted is that the right word don't know discouraged there we go um but it was nice to come back after we had rewritten it after we had thrown ideas and it people laughing and having good time it just felt good um my religion classes felt awful well not awful but felt uncomfortable because did not do any of the readings did not even turn in the discussion question which made me feel awful because normally even if though haven't done the readings in it entirety try my best to to at least put some kind of discussion question or discussion comment and be involved in that but there is that got to take notes on my laptop for the first time today which was nice fulfilling experience felt more in tune wanna say felt more alert maybe it was because didn't have to like didn't have pen to fidget but it was constant typing felt like um guess 'cause guess 'cause typing you can look at the professor and know that you're typing the right thing 'cause you know the keyboard whereas with writing it harder to do that but so could look and just felt like was retaining more knowledge was more involved which was good um memorized my monologue worked on that for my final performance on monday for my others acting classes and worked with my professor there and it was fantastic love working with him he amazing he is so energetic and inspirational and it was just wonderful to like see this monologue that had with my vision and him guiding me to flesh it out and and flesh it out to something even bigger than what originally had and it was just nice um it late uh i'm exhausted i'm happy but tired little bit stressed about like final but it will be okay i'll be home in couple weeks and i'm excited and then it'll be wonderful so good night sleep tight don't let the bed bugs bite ugh 
92,well today was interesting day went to class today it was my last class where learned something in mathematics um it it was fine it was enjoyable get the concepts have midterm tomorrow so was stressed about that um like know the concepts that the weird thing know the concepts just need to refresh them um waited for my [path] we ended up having to move the meeting later on um she accidentally slept through longer than she intended which is fine felt good about that like it it it okay it happens to the best of us uh ended up eating and having good time um with some friends then came here or came to my dorm intended to sleep 'cause uh ended up feeling like huge headache like not not sick but just huge headache and it was awful and tried sleeping slept for very little um actually no couldn't sleep yet so then went got some tea um and did work um felt great about that about getting ahead doing or not getting ahead but catching up 'cause i'm little bit behind and that what probably where my stress have been coming from it like knowing that i'm behind knowing that have so much work and knowing that cannot do all of it and the reason like why cannot do all of it is 'cause had some people come over like some of my roommates' friends um it came over and you know we was hosts and stuff and that fine no the thing is hmm they're great people and like hanging out with them and think today really got close to them but there been lot of tension throughout just due to relationship issues and um kinda became the middleman know lot of people don't like the stress of being like the middleman slash messenger of having to like relay one message to the other etc etc but don't know for us it felt kind of purposeful like just helping people [inaudible] and making them feel comfortable so felt like had sense of worth in that moment especially 'cause like earlier today um you know we was being loud and hanging out and it you know time for people to study and my proctor came up and she was asking us to quiet down and if we had alcohol and which had empty bottles that was left over from mon wanna say months ago and um she took that and she uh just feel like she looked at us differently which made us feel awful and ended up having to take walk and was questioning you know do do belong here at [redacted] because some people just seem to get how to live life and and sometimes feel like don't um but felt better uh like just walking and praying and getting my head about that um and just deciding i'm gonna do the best that can regardless and so i'm tomorrow i'm gonna dedicate it all to preparing for my midterm and studying for that and hopefully can get or some know that i'm gonna pass but it just one of that moment where it like want to do well feel like should do well i've i've had plenty of opportunities and if don't do well it my own fault don't know anyway i'm gonna go to sleep feel tired feel happy but tired very tired good night 
93,today was nice um think today was the beginning for very studious week and very studious just kind of lifestyle from now on spent quite some time at the library just studying and reviewing notes and preparing for my midterm today which took in some areas felt extremely confident in my answers in other areas not so much but what can you do um i'm trying to think uh cl had my final acting clu acting class acting comedy class and had my final religion class today um which was nice it was fun uh we ha it was nice to like see 'cause have final in my religion class and have to like planned myself when was gonna do my rough draft when was gonna do this and it was just nice to have that schedule it felt like foundation of uh order and normally like to just go with the flow but recently i've enjoyed order and i've an-and it made me extremely happy to see how was ordering myself and how ordered reading [wake] uh 'cause i've been looking into that and kind of deciding how was gonna study and how was gonna do this and how was gonna do that which is very helpful uh and for some reason guess it just gets me more determined and more hyped um so there some highs that had today ate with some friends which was nice um we went to pretty good restaurant enjoyed it um don't have much money in my bank account right now but um hopefully gets the scholarship cashback and gets to put that in and that'll help me out for the rest of the semester and all the way into next year and it will kinda carry over let see any lows uh for some reason i've been feeling just don't wanna say down but guess some would classify it as down but just little bit out of out of it don't know why but uh it just something that there and it not like overwhelming or or even something that annoying it just something that happens to be there um which is fine it okay but i'm feeling better now i'm feeling good i'm feeling confident so i'm gonna go to sleep i'm excited for tomorrow tomorrow believe is my mat last math class and i'll be done and then have one more class and then it over so that my plan good night

102,so today is very very eventful and important day um it kind of starts off with the fact that it snowing uh have only seen snow couple of times and it never been extr like uh an extreme amount and so waking up and looking outside and seeing that it slightly snowing was like oh man this is wonderful and started working on my paper and then looked outside and noticed that it was snowing harder and it was just absolutely beautiful and seeing it right now um is phenomenally beautiful and it makes me excited you know got to play in the snow little bit today and throw snowballs and just jump in it it funny just jumped in it and felt like kid and felt great felt like was having fun um it was also one of my great friend it was their birthday and it was wonderful to uh we had surprise party and it it was wonderful to see their reaction and just see him smile and uh uh it was just so wonderful because he definitely deserved great party and great birthday and i'm glad i'm extremely glad that he got that worked extremely hard on my essay i'm almost done uh have very little to do left and i'm gonna revise it and i'll turn it in and i'm so excited i'm at good pace for reading week feel good feel feel like haven't done as much work as wanted to but i'm at decent pace to where know i'll be okay so it sounds like had great day and definitely did got to interact with my entryway which was fun we got hot chocolate uh talked to lot of friend like uh it was great day it was phenomenal except for one bad thing that was very bad and that really did bring me down for little bit and it got me kind of stressed and kind of annoyed and just uh it shifted me in direction didn't wanna go thankfully it wasn't long before was able to shift back but got bill from the hospital [inaudible] was admitted into the emergency room and it was 336 and that lot of money don't have job don't have you know money on hand have savings but that something that my parents gave me and that i've worked for and have to go into that and don't know i've been having to go into that recently because of just like needing to get money for food needing to get money for groceries and my parents is more than willing to help me out but it just want don't know feel like should be independent and feel like this was definitely something that did something caused and so i'm di-digging into my savings for this and it hurts because you know it not something want uh it ridiculous amount of money to me don't know and it kind of bugged me but faced it the like factually and logically there nothing can do can't go back in times can't you know plead with him like hey take this away and they'll take away the fee have to pay it so i'm gonna dig into my savings i'll pay the fee and um i'll just get job soon and put that money back and um with an scholarships that i've got and hopefully i'll um in january i'll be able to replace my savings and all the savings i've taken out this semester that thought oh have plenty of money i'll be fine but don't know think i'll be okay know i'll be okay everything will work out i'm happy and think i'm glad that that happened on day that was super happy because can look at the positives anyway good night 
103,well today finished my essay which was very key part of my day because was very satisfied with it thought it was well written thought had done it well um so was very happy with it very satisfied um also got to relax little bit today played some videogames with my roommate um so there was that did quite few of my readings which was great um or did quite bit of my readings so that was good took notes over it which was even being because now was more familiar with the structure of it which really just don't know provided me with some help um i'm trying to think today kind of felt like blur like everything was just going by super super quickly and it kind of sucked but you know that how it goes sometimes uh came to terms with the whole um hospital bill and have little thought board in my room which wrote down some of my thought of just like everything will be okay all have to do is keep up my pace that i'm doing for readings week and tomorrow and the next day i'm just gonna grind extremely hard and um all have to do is pay the hospital bill take it out of my savings it'll be okay work for the county during the summer rebuild my savings and should be okay and everything will be okay and um that do mean that probably will not travel or will probably not study abroad which is okay that not big you know downer for me because on the bright side you know get some money and have the financial ability to support myself during the semester next year and everything so i'm excited for that um felt really happy also felt kind of just little bit down because whenever ask my professor to look over my essay which it was due today and wish could have um had her look over it earlier but she didn't respond couple day ago and whenever she did it was late and didn't read it and uh oh well you know she looked over it and she wasn't too fond of well wouldn't say that but uh just the way that she edited it don't know it kind of like made me worry if my essay was good enough was it not good you know so looked it over and did my best and the worst part is [inaudible] me and my roommate and couple of friends we went to ihop and we had awful awful service we was there for about two hours and 30 minutes um majority of it we didn't get we didn't get food um it didn't give me utensils it didn't give me napkins we just it was insane so was very annoyed at the service there and then that annoyance kind of carried over and was like looking over my essay and was like you know what whatever and kind of just wasted time screwing around trying to do it but just being unable to concentrate like throughout the entire day was able to concentrate until tonight whenever needed it to look over my essay and just turned it in um did my best though and well i'm gonna relax for bit probably for like 30 minutes and just goes to sleep so that my day i'm happy [so] [inaudible] [annoyed] but happy so anyway goodnight

271,oh excuse me it has been good day um yeah i've enjoyed today um went to church um hung out with some friends and then went to my cousin grad party part my ankle just now which felt amazing um everything was good everything was lot of fun you know um came home don't know just started feeling little bit lonely um like i've been in good mood all day today and hung out with lot of people today but don't know something about just maybe it being home alone um and my parents in foreign country and don't know decided i'm gonna ask um friends of mine out on date uh was gonna do it today if we went out to get tea which we ended up not because she has to open tomorrow morning but that fine um maybe i'll ask her tomorrow don't know but do intend on asking her out yeah life is good um feel good don't necessarily feel tired but do at the same time um my knee hurting lot but that whole different situation don't know wanted to play video games but left my remote or my controllers at my cousin so that was downer [laughter] um but guess that it might be plus if can focus more on what need to focus like actually getting work done and shit don't know i'm tired i'm not even that tired it just more of like oh this is the thing that has to get used to don't know drank tea don't know why felt like drinking tea um so yeah how boring is this for you do you ever just get bored don't know i'm thinking lot just lot of questions going through my mind uh not necessarily negative thing just questions on uh khushali which is my religion maybe was that too personal don't know um not bad thing just like like to be curious about thing questions about you know people don't know it weird i'm getting bored can feel myself getting bored and that problem but you know you know what it say anyway good night 
272,it has been good day um hung out lot with friends which was real which was really nice um sort of hung out with friends around 530-ish give or take uh 10 minutes and um before that was just chilling in my house wasn't really doing anything um just relaxing playing video games uh did some work in the sense that um looked up some movie information that need to be as producer for next semester um which was nice um yeah hanging out with friends was good felt good and happy throughout the day felt really i'm gonna say determined but felt guess ready for work don't know um just like felt prepared guess that good word um yeah so it was good day had lot of fun with friends uh we played lot of video games we spent lot of time together saw some stuff um yeah really don't know what to say like it just standard day just was feeling down at some point um later in the evening don't know it just the girl was gonna ask for date has said not to do that uh she friends of mine really good friends of mine who realistically the best option is just for me to move on and just like nothing really caused me to think that it just you know was hanging out with her today and maybe part of that but part of it is also just need to move on need to move forward and all that which is kinda what i'm doing which kind of bums me out but don't know probably for the best anyway i'm gonna go to sleep hopefully can wake up late tomorrow um yeah god this bed feels so good good night 
274,today been day today been great day kind of um [inaudible] was lot of fun really enjoyed myself today hung out with friends and really enjoyed that um but at the same time was flirting with my friends ex who um he always claimed how he didn't have feelings for her anymore and he didn't care what happened to her and all this other stuff and was flirting with her for bile for while and then it escalated um to some pretty spicy stuff if do say so myself i'm sorry but um then texted my friends was like hey do it bug you and he was like yeah and so stopped that and then don't know helped him out helped out my friends with um he interested in another girl and was helping him out with that and realized how lonely feel and what sucks is like don't have anybody to really talk to about it think partially that my fault don't open up well i've never been somebody that open up well can just keep everything inside and that okay like still feel happy like at the core of me but right now feel disappointed in myself annoyed that allowed myself to to go as far as did um i'm also annoyed that i've been in love with the same girl for years and annoyed at the fact that told her and now can't exactly talk to her about my problems because she feel award it all drama that don't matter in few months none of this will matter and it okay and think that kinda the mentality that have think that why i'm happy at my [inaudible] 'cause know everything will work out and nothing matter but at the exact same time everything matter don't know hopefully tomorrow i'll feel better but right now don't feel much just don't don't know there is some moments where just look at what i've done or look at like what happening i'm like yeah don't really feel much it whatever don't care and wonder how that is i'm gonna go sleep now yeah good night 
275,it has been great day um already i'm sure you can tell huge difference between my attitude today and my attitude yesterday personally i'm not as exhausted today as was yesterday uh though today definitely am very tired i'm about to pass out um spent lot of my time at home playing video games hanging out with myself and just watching netflix and stuff and then went running with my friend with good friend of mine um we ran for bit had good time um talked about movies which was nice it was it was good um thing and had really enjoyed running so was really happy to be back into that uh think i'm gonna try running again tomorrow um think got some lotion on my eye ah this hurts all right i'm just gonna close that for second um anyway now uh after running um oh after running went back to my house and then was changi or getting ready to shower [whenever] friend of mine asked me or was telling me about how it needed somebody else to go with them into town and then decided to go with them um it was good oh yeah definitely had lotion on my eye had lotion on my hands and then rubbed my eye which hurts but you know anyway um yeah so went with them into town had good time really fun just hanging out with them and making jokes uh then came back home had some dinner played video games watched netflix and yeah that about it didn't talk to as many people digitally today which left me feeling still good uh some of the emotions from yesterday kinda carried over today um some guilt or um not being satisfied with how was etc but i'm feeling better now anyway i'm gonna go to sleep good night 
276,today was good day uh didn't consist of much but it was good nonetheless um played little video games watched lot of arrested development um yeah and then went running for about an hour and half which is good and then cleaned up little bit and uh ate with an friends came back played more video games and now i'm about to head uh to sleep so tomorrow i'm going to wake up early and um mow the lar mow the yar-yard the yard and then yeah i'm gonna get that done tomorrow believe my parents come back so i'll be able to interact with them again really need interaction to survive if not i'll die [laughter] um yeah but yeah it it been good day um yeah not much to really talk about um live boring life here at home kind of um hang out with friends lot which is really just what do every day until get job which hopefully hopefully is soon need job that way can get money and then can buy things and spend money want to buy new clothes and buy things don't need but you know it'll be fine anyway i'm gonna go to sleep good night 
277,think there something wrong with me mentally don't uh don't know i'm feeling insanely lonely think don't know and the thing is haven't have sh shouldn't feel lonely don't think but uh but do hung out with friends today and there is moments where feel connected but there is moments where just feel like i'm on the outside looking in and feel nothing and think i'm losing it mentally i'm parked in parking lot to to fitness center um don't know why think lot of my negativity and self-loathing and hesitation comes from my own thoughts think that true for anybody think that why need to be social creature because if not just listen to myself and can't stand it and think it it starting to dawn on me why i'm like that don't think i'm good person think am one of the worst person i've ever met think i'm horrible and think i'm mean and think i'm rude and think uh don't know don't think i'm depressed but uh looking back especially towards the second semester it might be possible to say that was but don't know don't wanna talk to anybody about it really don't don't think anybody will take it seriously really don't don't know what to do don't wanna go home think need to clear my head before driving again because everything to this spot just feel like blur and feel like might have been driving recklessly and need to keep that in check before that becomes problem goodnight
