3,um today spent most of the day with my friends because um got really lucky and ended up having new like i've was really lucky and found friends group here in college much faster than thought would and so i've been spending lot of time with them um but i've been also dealing with um my boyfriend who goes to different college and he trying to adjust to life there and he misses me lot and it pretty difficult for me because um i've known for the past probably last mo past month that i've wanted to break up with them and wanted to wait until got until came to to to college because didn't wanna end it while was you know still on vacation and it was his birthday this past week and so didn't wanna you know break up with them before before school started and or before his birthday around that time of festivities or whatever um and so i'm dealing with that and it it very difficult because he very clingy and he doesn't understand that he bothering me lot and that you know need my own space and that have new friends and it also that wanna realize tha thought was gonna be with them for long long time but realize that in college i'm meeting new people i'm with you know new environment and i'd really like to meet new guys new people um and so it difficult for me just to talk to them it it it even hard for me to talk to them doesn't wanna talk to them in the evenings used to share lot more details with them then before then do now um so i'm just trying to deal with that and i'm trying to find the best time to break up with them because really need to end it wanna move on with my life i've met somebody else who think is really really cute and so wanna like connect with them bit more um but i've been having pretty i've had pretty good day 'cause went to my my spanish class and it was really engaging and it wasn't as intimidating as thought it was gonna be and met new friends there too so we're gonna grab lunch next week um and just got like got lot of things done um tried to paint my nails today but it wasn't really successful um so i'm gonna have to try again and do that and it like college is just about figuring things out and meeting new new meeting new people and trying new experiences and today went to the activities fair which was really cool because joined was i'm into joining like lot of dance clubs um but also signed up for boxing which was totally totally unexpected so might drop running and end up going to boxing instead because running something can do on my own um and i'm really interested to do volunteering um and really like my class lot of my friends is in my class so think that it gonna be really fun to have them there but also meet new people um so i'm just trying to like navigate it all and trying to figure out um how to do things on habitual daily basis like doing my laundry um today was like little frustrated 'cause my nails didn't turn out as well as would've liked it the first time i've ever done them by myself and so it was just tough to do by myself um but was really happy yesterday because my friends came over and i've just been in really good place in terms of making friends and doing stuff and it lot better than thought it would be because make doesn't make friends that easily or not in the same environment as people do so need to connect one-on-one but it just kind of happened and i'm really glad that it did 
4,today went to dance auditions and it was kinda weird because was going into it thinking that i'd do pretty well but it was actually kind of awkward because went in and it turns out that i'm not as good at dancing as thought was or it takes me more time to learn choreography than it do for other people so was feeling really down while was around like like through most of the first half because just was it wasn't that was uncomfortable but felt really out of my depth and thought oh my god i'm not as good as thought was um but just you know kept going through it 'cause it was five hours of auditions um and then the second choreograph-choreography that learned was much better um and then by the time got to the third one felt like felt more confident 'cause was just freestyling it even if it wasn't the exact thing that it wanted um so hopefully get um placed into one or more company pieces maybe not in the exclusive group but um in the company pieces um so that was most of my day 'cause got got back last night to my dorm at 230 and then got locked out of my room [inaudible] so didn't go to bed until 300 but woke up around 930 and just skipped breakfast and went to lunch and had like really big had big lunchbrunch whatsit um and the thing is like i'm having hard time gauging how much food i'm eating because at home like it was always really clear for me how much should be eating um but now it not that clear to me and it like stresses me out because wanna make sure that i'm not overeating and that been problem for me 'cause there like so much abundance of food around and there so many thing to choose from that sometimes have harder time like choosing which one wanna do um but i'm you know i'm working it out and and as the you know the all these events with food come join my ac my club stuff dies down it gonna be bit better um last night got walked home by the guy that i'm into and that was really really fun he fell asleep on my shoulder while we was watching movie um and then we made plans for brunch these morning so we had brunch and now we're at one of the libraries hanging out gonna watch netflix um so i'm like happy about that um finished my linguistics reading these morning which was really nice so just have to takes notes on that and have to do my reading for one of my other classes so it two chapters of the textbook which should be fine wanna get that done tomorrow before go out to [redacted] um i'm like i'm i'm in good place right now just really wanna break up with my boyfriend because it weight over my shoulder and wanna have other meaningful relationships like with these guy that i'm into so um that just been really frustrating for me because i'm very much over it and i've been over it for weeks but he still floating around and he still he not bothering me but he doesn't know that i'm not in love with him anymore and just wanna be and it sounds awful but just wanna be over with it because it run it course for me and i'm ready to move on so i'm gonna talk to my parents and see how that go and hopefully end that pretty quickly because i'm want that out of my life and wanna move on and meet new people or whatever um so just have to figure out how i'm gonna do it but think i'm gonna do it in the next day or so because it getting really really tiresome and doesn't wanna be doing thing with guy when i'm dating someone else and not say that have boyfriend i'm not gonna do that um and have no it sounds pretty bad but have no like ethical problem with it just doesn't wanna do it because feel like it unfair even if it something that i'm gonna go ahead and do anyway so just wanna make sure that these doesn't like speed up before break up with my boyfriend so have to do that so we'll see how that go 
5,uh today woke up around 830 and was kinda upset because didn't sleep longer um got back at like 200 last night again and was really upset that didn't sleep longer but did and was kind of up an wondering if should go to audit another audition not really an audition but um another dance showcase event like introduction to the dance group that wanted to join wasn't really feeling it but ended up going anyway because um didn't make it to the one auditioned at yesterday so thought i'd just keep my options open and went to breakfast and did little bit of work and then went and it was pouring rain don't have raincoat yet because my mom hasn't bought me one which is fine um and went there and actually had ton of fun really like doing the american smooth we did like little bit of swing which loved and actually thought ballroom was gonna be not boring but wasn't going to do it changed my mind to do modern instead but i'm just gonna keep options open and do that too maybe can do two dance group we'll see um uh but left little bit early 'cause wanted to eat lunch in the in the dining hall instead of staying and eating pizza with everybody else 'cause wanted to have healthy food and was also just wanted to finish an stuff up so met up with friend and then with with few friend and then went off with one of the friend and went uh end up in one of the libraries and we just talked for an hour and half it was actually pretty deep conversation which was nice um and then mom and dad came and picked me up and went and had dinner with them um and we talked uh alternative school paths and things that i'm gonna do um in the future like changing my major potentially um and we also talked about my boyfriend how that whole things gonna go down and whether or not i'm gonna break up with them and how to do that have you decided when i'm gonna do it and how i'm gonna do it so feel little bit better about that 'cause it more definite um i'm just really happy about that um and had really nice night with them it make uh pita salad which is my favorite salad um and now i'm back and i'm hanging out with an friend which is really really great and it just been good day 'cause really ended up liking the dance group that went to today and i'm hoping that can continue doing it uh have such busy week coming up have all sorts of club event every single night this week and one night don't get back until midnight um so that that good um mean it not good but i'm back at midnight and we'll see how that go hope can maintain weirdly different sleep schedule but at least my courses the earliest one is only at 1000 am twice week the other day it at 1100 so i'm really really lucky schedule-wise um and i'm just excited for the week everything really fun have friend in my courses so um we're gonna see how it go yeah 
6,today woke up around 900 early even though went to bed at 345 last night which was kind of annoying um but i've just been having really good day um skipped breakfast today just because woke up late and didn't want to go to annenberg at 900 have to rush to get to annenberg at 900 then have to go back at 100 or something so just ended up working in my room and then left for lunch around noon and then decided that needed to finish some of the work for one of my classes so did that and took some online quiz um and didn't do as well as wanted and it just bringing back all the memories of when was taking the same subject in '08 when was taking chem in sophomore year when was not very good at it and really doubted all my strength and stuff like that and it was just really frustrating because my teacher always made me feel dumb even though don't think i'm dumb and i'm just like the feelings of uncertainty are coming back to me and really really don't like it um but i'm just gonna power through it and hope that it better because now it there lot more support there lot more people willing to help me lot more places can turn to which are really nice and have friends in my section that got tonight um and then went to ballroom dance info meeting and right as was finishing was gonna go to like boxing opening meeting except two of my friends realized just as got to uh got to the the boxing meeting or outside the building that it next monday and so we was just kind of dumb we ended up going back to friends dorm to work and then we went to one of the events in the yard today and had some fun and then went to went to meeting for one of the other clubs want to join which was really nice and now i'm back working with everyone else um friends of mine was talking to the guy that i'm into and he interested it kind of weird like he not ready for relationship apparently but he interested but he if he not if he hanging out with me he having good time but if he not with me it like totally fine and he don't like necessarily feel the need to like reach out but it was kind of vague so it like i'm not go he apparently according to my friends he not like willing or he not he don't need to like seek out or do he want to but when we're talking it like totally fine um so it kind of weird and i'm just didn't know if should like back off or not you know not be as for mean haven't been that forward because i've still got the boyfriend thing and because also do want to take it slow don't mind taking it slow but now feel weird being like continuing to you know flirt with him or whatever so i'm gonna just see how it go and you know be myself and if at one point he tells me oh like take it slow or i'm not ready then like i'll just re-evaluate from there like hopefully it not that want to change his mind but hopefully like as time passes um and we spend more time together because we have some classes together hopefully he'll realize oh this might be fun or whatever uh and if that ends up being the case then we can still go slow like don't mind doing that just hope that he as interested in him in me as are in him so we'll see uh have to break up with my boyfriend i'm gonna do that tomorrow before go to classes which kind of sucks but haven't spoken to him all day and that going kind of good for me because it given me some peace but think he probably just really upset with me and just need to finish and ends it tomorrow because it weighing on me so we'll see how that go 
7,today was good day it was little bit stressful but it was overall good day um woke up around 800 and well no woke up around 800 and realized that i'd stained the bed because got my period this morning so that was little bit annoying and had to take care of that but it just another part of being an adult and getting used to things like that and taking care of it myself usually have my parents help me out when things like this happen um but after that just ended up going to breakfast and did and went to the gym afterwards which fi didn't really wanna go but thought you know wha might as well go i'm gonna have nothing else to do and feel bad if don't go so went and then took care of an random things in my dorm and then went to lunch and had class um and then got really really anxious because broke up with my boyfriend today um and it was really hard because he kinda started negotiating with me and not 'cause told him that don't have the time to hang out the truth is couldn't tell him the truth couldn't tell him that don't really love him anymore and that i've just moved on from that part of my life and it not even his fault it nothing that he did really but i've just i'm not into it anymore need to move on and wanna meet other people i've met this other guy already that i'm really really interested in and hope that that ends up working out so tried to ends it and he starts negotiating me oh we can figure out time to meet it don't have to be for that long and said me said you know we this isn't negotiation this is it it over and can't do anymore it too stressful and he started to cry at the ends and fe just felt awful but it like weight have been lifted from my shoulders and i'm just kinda moving on and it not affecting me too much it probably will affect me more in the future but we'll just have to deal with it think it'll be easier because like he not around him and i'm not seeing him that much um after that just kinda wander around picked up an textbooks and an bo uh package from the ma the mail center um and then met up an friends in his dorm and hung out with the guy that i'm into um that also makes me anxious because can tell that he like somewhat interested but he also holding back little bit and don't know if should be more forward or not be forward 'cause he more shy so i'm not sure like how much is too much and don't wanna like have him run away from me or anything so just gonna see how that go and it like in the context of friends group um there this one other girl that everybody that an people is that really like and it really wanna let her into the friends group but get the feeling that she like super fake and not that nice and just kind of don't want her to be in it but like she going to be in like my inner circle and i'm already kinda worried about blocking group which is really dumb but just hope she don't ends up in my blocking group and don't get tight enough with tight enough with me because i'm just not fan of her and it catty girl things maybe but i'm just not feeling it that much um but he like been really nice actually he lent me his like hef uh headphones and like gone out of his way to do an really nice things for me um so that was really nice um hope it go well i'm on my way to dance audition right now and then have dance practice after that so i'm not getting back to my room until 1200 but it should be fine we'll see how it go i'm kinda sad that i'm not seeing the rest of the squad tonight but feel like should makes myself unavailable so that the guy that i'm into you know absence makes the hearts makes the hearts grow fonder kind of things i'm not stressed about school yet but will be at an point we'll see how it go 
8,today was really tired because woke up at 800 after having gone to bed around 200 so went to bed late um but it not as bad because it doesn't doesn't have to wake up at 600 or 700 to get to class and can take my time in the morning which is really nice for me um had my it kinda not it wasn't an official day because there no [inaudible] but still had uh like legit linguistics class and went to my spanish class and they're both really really great um and then went to health services because i'm having problem with my foot and so had to get an ray had to wait for them to tell me what going on it kind of tendinitis um so have to like rest my foot which is really frustrating because it means that can't do dance or boxing or running or really anything for the next one to two weeks and that gonna interfere with me joining groups and stuff like that but at least can go lift weights which is nice um but that really stressing me out because really want to be partic-participate on these things with these things on campus and now can't um and ironically was originally gonna do ballroom and auditioned for these other groups that didn't even get into and now can't do ballroom which was the original plan so moral of the story doesn't change the original plan go with your gut um so that was like th that was really stressful because had to be at my one of my class had to be back insi in one of the buildings for section and was wasn't late but was really stressed about it and was almost in tears at an point because wasn't sure how long things was gonna take um so now i'm wearing boot on my foot not really boot it like flat shoe type things and it annoying but it is what it is um and then after section went with an friends and we had dinner and then we went to hear speaker talk and it was really controversial and there was like security and police and ids shown and everything and then after that we just came back and did homework and now we're hanging around um got lot of work done on my pset which is nice got really ahead so i'm feeling bit better about it um and now i'm probably just gonna go watch netflix or relax 'cause i'm burned out and need to like relax for the day 
9,um today went to class and had pretty light day 'cause was able to go to class at 1100 and then had another class at 100 and it was just really nice 'cause was able to do some work in the dining hall and then walk around and take my time so wasn't in rush which is always really nice for me um after my second class went and did some work and then went back to my friend apartment dorm thing where hung out and did some homework and then went to dinner 'cause one of the roommates had date um then hung out in the dining hall for some hour or so and then went back and then left 'cause wanted to hang out with guy that i'm interested in like different guy from the one i've been talking about um like kind of into both but like wanna see how it go and we hung out and then went back to my room around don't know 100 and then stayed and talked with friend for three hour which was really really fun and now he gone and it 430 am and should go to bed 
10,today woke around 800 and just went to breakfast after that and reviewed some of the readings for my uh spanish class um saw few friends in the dining hall and then went to my spanish class which was fine um it kinda went fast-paced which was really annoying not annoying but it was tough to follow because there was some people like ha referencing all sorts of things that didn't know was things to reference um and but it was really it was really interesting like got lot out of it and learned lot about the poem we was analyzing um and then went to lunch and hung with some people met in my class it was really nice to find out it was freshmen so know i'm not the only one which is nice to know um and then after that went to uh went out to [redacted] because needed to buy some shirts and some pens and only found the pens didn't find any clothing because nothing fit and it was like expensive uh then came back and my foot ha been really hurting me because of the tendonitis things that have so was like walking around and went and picked up some fliers for club that do and then went to the jobs fair but there wasn't anything good so did lot of walking in vain and then went to meeting for premed students with some friends and had dinner and then we went and it was really dinner was really fun because the guy that i'm into was like more outgoing and think he kind of is coming out of his shell which is really nice and think that it was caused by the fact that hung out with another guy last night think he like got that kind of vibe uh even though he doesn't know for sure um [inaudible] been really nice um so we'll see how that goes and now i'm at friends house and think i'm gonna end up sleeping over here with like bunch of other people so um we're just like having good time and like i'm tired but it so fun and love my class and really like the friends that met and everything that going on so i'm in really good and happy place um and like everything been better since broke up so with my boyfriend that was like weight off my shoulders so that it been really good and i'm having fun time 
11,um today didn't get much that much sleep because went to bed around 400 and then um since like me and all my friends slept over um one of my friends was snoring and didn't really get mu that much sleep so woke up at 800 um and then went to lunch brunch at 1200 and then after that went out with some friends to ne to bo to [redacted] um and we went shopping little bit and it was pretty fun um and then we come we got back and we did bit of work at before dinnertime uh and then was walking to dinner and it was it was fun and then at dinner was kinda weird just because the guy that i'm into just like didn't really talk to me has been kind of like actively ignoring me ever since and don't really know what up and don't know what did to cause this it just kind of confusing for me because thought it was going well and apparently he just needs time to process but it just like don't make that much sense to me and don't know if that means that it good for me or not and i'm just like kind of tired of having to deal with this like it it feels like dating and relationships are so much easier for other people and like always get tangled with like guy that don't know what they're doing or like has it has issues or like it don't want to do stuff and it just like it like that want to find somebody but just wish that it wasn't so like perceptually more difficult for me to deal with this like figure it out and do what everybody else do so easily because it just don't know what i'm doing wrong and don't know why it turning out like this and guess just has to roll with it and see what happens um but i'm just like kind of i'm like tired because haven't been getting that much sleep lately but which i'm getting used to but it also just like really frustrating don't understand why um like why are it back and forth like it fun but it also not fun because don't really know what to be expecting so yeah that was the day i'm probably gonna leave soon 'cause don't want to has to deal with this right now just want to probably be alone and process like he processing but whatever 
12,today got moderate amount of sleep and even though didn't press the button last night know went to bed around 230 at 230 um and so woke up and got goodnight sleep um even though was um at my friend dorm again and went and ate breakfast with friend and then did my laundry and went to lunch and with friend and did some work spent most of my day doing work and think something didn't go down quite right because felt really nauseous after lunch and so was in the library doing work and just felt really really bad and so came back here and had lasagna and couldn't have any because didn't want any and um things are going pretty well and then like i'm top of my classes and everything are generally fine um um things are going well with this guy but it like weird because he complimented this other girl sweatshirt like 10 minutes ago and it like it just sweatshirt and he never like compliments me even though we was like getting pretty close last night like hanging out and stuff and it just don't really get why he like doing that and he don't compliments me like 'cause he think it gonna be too obvious if he compliments me don't really get it so it kinda frustrating she like weirdly clingy not clingy but she just like weirdly giving signs that she into him and it just bugs me because don't understand what he doing and can't tell if she can tell that i'm into him they're jus it like back off and she not backing off and don't get it 'cause it clear to everybody else in my group that he and are like into each other and so it been really really annoying and they're watching stupid movie right now and just want the movie to end so that sh-she can leave and he can hurry up and finish his math work so that we can watch netflix together um 'cause like that when stuff happens and it just really nice and i'm just frustrated because thought it was going well now like don't really know where stand with him and it like it went really well last night after recorded my last one but it just weird back and forth and don't really get why he doing this if he does maybe he don't even realize it way back and forth but it totally are um so i'm just gonna like hang out and see what happens i'll be here late again but it just such weird back and forth and it like why play games like didn't really played like one games but like didn't even want it to be games just was trying something out so don't really understand anyway 
13,this morning finally woke up in my own bed [laughter] um and just went to breakfast and went to my first class which was really in-interesting um and just kinda went through the day and it was it was fine like breakfast was good and lunch was good 'cause was talking um to this guy and everything and it was great um and then after had class just went to lunch and hung out with some friends and then went to the gym 'cause even though my foot is all messed up 'cause of the tendonitis need to be exercising so went and lis lifted some weights for 45 minutes um took shower and then went and did some work and was really lucky that got most if not all of my work done before the evening festivities began so went and dropped off my pset for one of my class and then came back and did some more work and then went to dinner it was kind of late dinner but came back and started to hang out and the apartment was empty except for me and this guy and like nothing happened but it was really really nice um and we started we was watching netflix and now there people around and we're gonna see what gonna happen um it just like day-by-day kinda thing and we'll see how it goes feel really bad had ice cream even though said this week was gonna be no-carb week and i'm really upset because ice cream isn't like good carb that you should be eating and it not that think i'm fat it just that need to be having more discipline because at home have lot more discipline and it just like frustrating should know should be more disciplined than am right now and it working it i'm gonna try it again today it was slip-up but will make it better it just kinda worries me because used to have so much self-control and now don't and it frustrating me but i'm working on it so think it should be fine need to just tell myself in the moment that shouldn't do it and reinforce it and all that kinda thing so hopefully it'll be better tomorrow 
15,slept really well last night but woke up early which was annoying um but had enough time to get through all my classes today and almost kind of fell asleep in my linguistics classes even though had enough energy don't know why think it because didn't have coffee and then went to spanish which was good and had lunch with some friends and went to the gym which was really good use of my time and felt really good and then had to change immediately and go to the go to classes for section and didn't get out of classes until like 600 and then went to dinner and had too much food that shouldn't of eaten well didn't have too much but didn't have the right kind of food so now feel really guilty and then had s'mores at study break which felt really bad about um and did was really productive got work done figured out how to do something in chem all by myself which is really really nice and now i'm just relaxing and hanging around and hoping that get to watch netflix with this guy but we'll see he not getting the hint so yeah um it was fine day just have to plan my weekend and plan my stuff out and see how it go so think everything going well so far thought was drowning underneath the amount of work and stuff like that had to do but i'm actually feeling pretty good so it fine

37,woke up early this morning even though went to bed late so that was bit annoying um and went took care of some stuff and then went to breakfast and hung around in in the dining hall until my class started which was nice then went to class after class after class um and the guy i'm dating gave me me pe-peanut butter and jelly sandwich so that wouldn't go hungry during chem which was really nice 'cause got to eat little bit of well the lecture started um and then after that went to office hours for chem so that would finish the problem set and didn't finish during the first set of office hours but then went to dance for little bit and came back to office hours and was successful finished around 630 which was bit annoying because had anticipate to finish around 600 go for run and then eat dinner but that didn't work out by the time was able to run it was dark so ate dinner by myself until the guy my guy showed up um and it was really nice and then we walked back to his dorm and then left 'cause had to do some work and we made plans to meet up later had meeting for with company company meeting tonight it was like about 40 minutes and it was actually quite nice and would've liked it lot more if it hadn't run so long 'cause almost didn't get to hang out with him this evening um and he just left and i'm bit confused because we spend lot of time together more than we used to before we had my talk and we spent lot of time together but he like physically distant and think he avoiding think he avoiding that until he comes to decision but don't understand like what mean do understand why the decision is taking so long but wish it weren't because don't know feel like if he don't want to be with me then it shouldn't be that difficult of decision so but maybe it not being with me that difficult it maybe it not maki maybe it not so much that um being with me is not being with me is difficult but that being with me is isn't easy that didn't make any sense um probably like being with me is difficult but like in the sense that he don't know if that what he want to do um so it'd be he would want like hmm don't know how to say it have to figure it out 
38,today woke up little bit early and was annoyed 'cause wanted to sleep in 'cause went to bed late last night and went to class had breakfast with friend and the guy i'm dating he asked me to look at his essay which was like ooh looking at his essay mean like he trusts me to look look at like writing writing is so personal writing is inherently personal so that was lot um that was really nice um did that for him and then he went off to class and once went off once came back from class went immediately for run 'cause knew wasn't gonna be able to run otherwise 'cause i'm lazy and felt really really good so i'm glad did that and then on the way back he texted me and was like oh if i'm still around or whatever and was like yeah of course i'm around so we ended up meeting on the steps of the library like talk about his paper even though could've come to his dorm room so it was like wait didn't realize what he wanted to do thought he was gonna go grab lunch with me [laughter] um and that was the last time saw him because he going home this weekend to visit his family um and after that went and did some laundry took shower after my workout and then met up with my junior year high school english teacher which was wonderful uh for lunch very belated lunch around 300 and then went took the bus into this town where live and met my parents there and then we had to run some errand then came back we came back to [redacted] for lunch for dinner and was there for like two and half hours it was really nice and we hung out in my parents' car for little while and he was like oh ballroom season be like very stressful for you and i'm like yeah it like it is what it is um um so i'm dropping ballroom 'cause it like lot and it in the evening and i'm not focusing on it that much um think think the other thing that am doing is very gonna be lot so um yeah so he convinced me to do that think he make se and was even convinced when we talked about it talked about lot of thing miss him but that just how life is and yeah i'm going to and then went to few parties and had like some hour-long conversation with girl who like part of the squad and was really glad did because she sweetheart and like talking to her so it like we bonded and so we're gonna have lunch together tomorrow 
39,today woke up at 645 and then went back to sleep for another half hour because had to staff research conference for some high schoolers um instead of being there at 800 like was supposed to got there at 825 but nobody noticed it and cared and it actually looked kinda surprised when showed up because nobody else was there really um but showed up and helped move chairs around and got the kids checked in and was there until ab till about 1200 was just tired need had headache because was tired and needed to drink water um and then came back and hung out outside um the dining hall until my friend showed up and we was gonna eat together um and we had like really nice conversation actually we was there for like some hour and we talked and got to know her bit better and so wanna hang out with her bit more and then after that went to get buy some eraser went to cvs to see if it had water six-packs of water but it didn't which was upsetting then came back and just took care of some errands took care of some tasks on the internet and did some things and took time for myself and had dinner in the room so had avocado and some fruit and some apple and it was wonderful uh and then facetimed my friend and she told me about all about her guy stuff and just oh no talked to my was doing some of my research 'cause i'm some ra for graduate student project and was doing my was doing the things she assigned me to do and it was tough so was texting with my parents about it 'cause it texted me in romanian which is weird think they've really gotten the message that wanna focus more on romanian and so was got help from my dad with the research that i'm doing and it was just kind of emotional ended up crying because say that i'm fluent in romanian but maybe i'm actually not and it just time for me to come to terms with that because i'm not really fluent in any language other than english even though it the things that love doing and [nothing] sounded right and was so affixed on making it sound like spanish but realized that like romanian is just like weird language and need to work through it and today was just weird day because realized that need to relax about things little bit more and realized that can try and control things but can't control everything and it just my my quality of life would be better if relax about certain things and that not to say to stop caring about things but have mindset in the sense that it not life or death and think that would help my mental state lot more because ended up crying with my dad on the phone about something that wasn't worth crying about um then went and took shower facetimed my friend and then my other friend came over and he and had pretty deep conversation wish hadn't said something but didn't give away too much so i'm not particularly worried it just don't um he don't need to know that much about my family uh but it was pretty deep he'd never spoken this much which was really nice and i've told him that he need to open up if he wants to like get somewhere and don't judge and it just about talking and getting to know each other and understanding each other which is what friendship is supposed to be about so it was good and he just left and now i'm gonna go to bed

93,woke up around 700-something which was annoying because didn't wanna wake up at 700 something wanted to wake up around 830 'cause was having breakfast with my friend at 930 and by the time breakfast rolled around was kinda light-headed 'cause was hungry um but went and ate had little bit bi-bigger breakfast 'cause knew wasn't gonna have that much lunch 'cause skip lunch on thursdays because of class so fre stayed and hung out with friend until 1100 which was really nice we just talked for like an hour and half um went to class went to linguistics oh my preceptor actually praised my paper which was quite nice um and then went to linguistics section the last one and then went to what is it called ls1a which was fun and interesting and the last also the last class so i'm grateful for that and went back to my room did an reading no ate ate yogurt uh have to buy an tomorrow went to called the doctor 'cause needed to make an appointment except need registration number so had to call the toll number and was on hold in total for like maybe half an hour and it really sucked and made an appointment with the doctor talked to except she can only take new patients in may so mom is trying to figure out how to get that moved earlier uh then went to work and for couple of hour and the meeting took forever so was really pissed was starving by the time go was got to dinner ate so much because was really hungry and then stayed in the [redacted] until brain break and then had ice cream and just ate frosting plain like why would just eat frosting but did and oreos and it was really bad um said no sugar until then but i'm lying to myself clearly um so have 20 today december 1st 'cause it past midnight i'm going to not have sugar until go to my grandmother place have 22 days can do it i'm been doing pretty good job until now so i've only had one slip-up days the other two days like was thanksgiving so i'm not counting that technically so i've only had one slip-up days since the 16th which is quite miracle actually
