5,today felt good when first woke up had pretty normal day had few things wanted to get done um getting closer to this evening felt more stressed out and anxious as my roommate decided to have her boyfriend over without really telling me in advance and then found out that he would be staying over the night as well which didn't really have an advance notice on causing me to be stressed out and feel uncomfortable staying in my room so felt like needed to go somewhere else so isolated myself and tried watching movies but that got my roommate to be frustrated at me because wasn't interacting with everyone else so just removed myself from the room and went off to read and reached out to my family back home for help and my mom was little bit helpful but she also just stressed me out more because she wanted me to reach out to people that i'm not really close with in the end did end up reaching out to another friend and hung out with her which really did make me feel lot better but still feel anxious about going back inside since my roommate and wasn't really getting along earlier and now she thinks that i'm upset with her and i'm not really sure what happened with her boyfriend but i'm gonna go back in and figure it out and in the future thinks i'll reach out to [redacted] and start talking to someone so don't feel stressed out and out of place and can feel more comfortable in my own space in my room 
6,today felt pretty lonely my roommate went back home and is staying home overnight so spent the majority of my day in my dorm room and spoke with my mom on the phone for bit but it really just stressed me out 'cause she was just complaining about my family back home and went shopping but the store was closed so couldn't get my school supplies which made me more anxious because have lot of stuff need to do for my [redacted] class coming up and can't do it until buy the supplies that need um and then i'm more stressed out because i'm shopping two new class this week so i'm gonna have to figure out whatever missed from the last week and lot of people in my entryway was hanging out today but didn't go with them and isolated myself which was not the best plan but have hard time interacting with people especially without having friend already there so isolated myself but i'm gonna work on it and made an appointment with huhs to go and talk to someone so hopefully that will help 
7,today generally felt little bit better went to new class that was super interesting um went to new club that had good time at spent the majority of my day with my friends and my roommate and we did have little bit of trouble but not too bad and talked um for while with my family back home and it was pretty good overall and friends from back home also called me and it was really nice talking to her for the little bit of time and other than that was little bit stressed about the class and having some stuff to do tomorrow just because of having to buy textbooks and being unsure of like how much wanted to spend but will be going to work later in the week and training for second job which will definitely help out the financial uneasiness and tomorrow i'll try out one more new class and hopefully my schedule will be set and that will help me to have little bit of stress relief because i'll definitely have set routine going into the week next week 
8,today was pretty good day overall had bunch of classes so got pretty busy with homework and stuff but managed to get all the assignments done that needed to get done i'm little bit behind on the reading but that just because i'm starting two new classes and still have to wait for my textbooks to come in so hopefully can get caught up tomorrow have pretty busy schedule but talked it out with some friends and it should go all right and i'm training for another job so hopefully that will help me to be less stressed about my financial situation um we had meeting with my entryway today but it was really crowded and hot so didn't stay for long i'm still glad that went because got to talk to few other people in my [inaudible] and got to hang out with my roommate and good friends from upstairs so overall it was pretty good day and may not get too much sleep tonight because still have quite bit of work to do and catch up on but i'm looking forward to the weekend when can have time to go back over everything and really prepare and hopefully get caught up in the classes that just started 
9,today was really good day wish i'd gotten little bit more sleep but after woke up super early got ready for class and had little bit of time to relax and put out some things before had to go to class and class was super interesting and i'm really excited because my book arrived so get to pick it up tomorrow and then i'll get to start reading and catch up on some of the work have been behind on and taking notes [inaudible] interesting have quite few assignments going into next week but my saturday and sunday looks pretty clear just have to pick up some shifts at work which i'll probably have time for tomorrow evening and and saturday evening so that should help and also just got trained for my second job today which was really easy and fun and should start that job either this week or next week which will be nice to get paid little bit more than usual by doing [a supplement] job and math is sort of stressing me out but think i'll get assigned to workshop which will definitely help because then i'll have someone that can help me with homework and things and make it go little easier also had my first day of lab today for my science course and it was really fun and just have to do lot for that but have friend that can work on it with which should make it easier so overall it was pretty good day 
10,today started out fairly well didn't really get enough sleep last night but still felt okay this morning just little bit sore classes were really fun and interesting and felt like really understood the work and had good time working with some classmates as well that helped make it little bit easier also went and worked with dorm crew for about two and half hours which were fun just having something to do that really felt productive and had time to relax in my room didn't really eat enough in the morning which didn't realize until later but then did eat and felt little bit better and towards the end of the evening started getting upset 'cause were just thinking about my cousin who passed away last year and my roommate really wanted to hang out with people but didn't want to but we did it anyway and just sort of got upset and she sort of made scene in front of other people so felt more awkward and so spent the rest of the evening alone in my room and it could kind of tell that were upset but didn't really feel like talking about it but tomorrow we're supposed to get some stuff in the mail and we're gonna go shopping so hopefully i'll feel little bit better then 
11,today was overall pretty good day got to sleep in little bit later and and then got the futon delivered to my dorm and so my roommate and opened it together and sort of spent the whole day relaxing got few of my text books in but decided to focus on homework tomorrow and try and get caught up on the week tomorrow and just spend time today relaxing with my roommate and friend of mine and my friend got into the band which was really awesome and we all went and had lunch together which was nice got to have ice cream and then my family from back home sent me surprise and so got that which was exciting and we basically spent the whole day relaxing in my dorm and sort of planning for the rest of the week we might go shopping for little bit tomorrow but also have to do all of my school work and then later this evening we hung out with people from my entryway and watched movie and made plans for sort of weekly movie night which will be really nice because it really good time to connect with other people and have sort of relaxed atmosphere so overall the week looking like it will go pretty well 
12,today overall went fairly well slept in really late which was nice and relaxing but also had lot of homework to get done and so sort of counterproductive ended up staying way too up way too late working on some of my stuff for class because was really stressed out and had hard time focusing on some of the things needed to get done had quite few assignments and projects due this week and definitely feel like i'm little bit behind but feel like it'll get better when actually go to class also have job training tomorrow so i'll be working shift so it looking like busy day and i'll be starting to set up some appointments to talk to counselor which would help and also need to call huhs to see about going to chiropractor because it hard to work on homework for extended periods of time because my back will get sore really easily so think definitely setting that stuff up for this week will help 
13,today was an okay day stayed up little bit too late last night trying to get an homework done 'cause ended up overthinking problem and confusing myself and having to spend longer time trying to figure it out because it was due today so still managed to get up on time and managed to get to class on time but think i'm gonna try and have set time to wake up every morning to keep into more of sleep schedule my other class went okay and my other high points of the day i'm probably getting my homework back because did well on it um talking to an new people in chemistry class and um working my first shift on my second job it was lot of hard work but sometimes just being able to do something that like manual labor is very helpful it makes you feel productive and it also sort of wears me out so feel little calmer and more relaxed whenever went back to my dorm room also got to stop by brain break and get an hot chocolate and snack which was really lovely and tomorrow only have one class so should have plenty of time to get my homework done for the next day and to work on an assignments that is due by the end of the week 
14,today was feeling pretty under the weather but still managed to get up and go to class felt pretty bad 'cause was kind of falling asleep during class so felt bad for my professor but still en managed to take some good notes and still get bit out of the class so it still good that went and then went back home and worked for few hours which was nice and then managed to get lot of homework done and went to dinner with some friends which was good 'cause haven't been making it to [redacted] on time to eat um and after that we went back to the dorm and took nap 'cause was still feeling pretty under the weather but think i'll feel better tomorrow i've gotten quite few assignments done and should finish up another one tonight so i'll have little bit less to do because picked up quite few shifts at work for thursday so my thursday will be pretty busy other than that i'm just little stressed out because both my class sectioned me for the same time so i'm gonna have to resection but will write them some email and in the end it should work out 
15,today was all right stayed up little bit too late with my roommate and friend because they didn't wanna go to bed and really should have gone to sleep because had lot of classes today and lot of homework that due 'cause i'm trying to get stuff done in advance so can work some shifts tomorrow so really stayed up too late and was kind of falling asleep in classes went by to try to get help with my homework but couldn't find my tf so [inaudible] instead and hopefully i'll hear back 'cause that'll make me feel little bit better about some assignment that gonna be due on friday i'm little stressed because i'm gonna have some exam next week that don't really feel like i'm ready for but since they most of the weekend should have plenty of time to do practice problems and think we're gonna get practice test as well in classes to take home so hopefully i'll have time to prepare for the exam my roommate going through really hard time with her boyfriend which is difficult for me as well because they needs some extra support right now but i'm really too busy to be exactly there all the time um they wanted me to stay up again with her tonight so plan on staying little bit later than wanted to because really needs to go to bed 'cause have some early classes and was falling asleep in classes the other day so think i'll just stay up with her for bit work on some more of my stuff while am and then wake up early to get coffee to try to make they through tomorrow and do have some appointment tomorrow with the counselor and meeting with my adviser in the morning so hopefully it'll all go okay because i'll get some support and maybe some other advice on what needs to do 
16,today was pretty stressful day woke up sort of late rescheduled meeting with my academic advisor because was too tired to go to it went to class um had few other things had to get done and then had to go to work which was stressful got caught in the rain couldn't finish my shift because it was late and couldn't get into the buildings so ended up getting back late to try and start my homework so i'm still up doing homework and my roommate having really rough time so she left to go to talk to someone and we kind of had little bit of an argument so i'm not really sure what to do and i'm not really sure if i'll get my work done 100 like wanted it to be because have class pretty early and just found out that i'll have another extra class have to go to tomorrow which will be interesting so hopefully can get it all done in time and get it turned in and and over the weekend should be less stressed because won't have work and i'll have time to prepare for next week and maybe get caught up and hopefully things with the roommate will work out better in positive was that went to counselling today so that was nice and really think that it'll start helping after start going regularly 
17,today overall was not the best day didn't get any sleep last night had to get up early for classes classes went fine but feel unprepared for my test that next week i'm just actually gonna have some trouble with the homework that was due this evening um went to work had some trouble with that had to work with some delivery guys and they weren't very happy and wanted me to call my boss and stuff so they was pretty stressful but in the end we got everything delivered they just took lot longer than they was supposed to um then went back to my dorm and tried to finish the assignment that had been struggling with and then heard from my mom who told me that my grandmother is in the hospital and they they not really anything her heart rate was just high so they fine but they just made me think of my cousin and the assignment was working on was over someone death which made me think of my cousin more so overall they weren't the best evening but sort of reached out to friend that haven't spoken to in while and they was there for me and my older sisters was which made they better and i'll get to sleep in tomorrow and meet up with some friend and go out to dinner and picked up some extra shift at work so they shouldn't be too bad and then should have plenty of time to study this weekend and get some homework done 
18,today did not go very well woke up pretty late and didn't really get much done because i've been pretty upset about my grandmother being in the hospital and my roommate and my friend didn't understand that and stuff that was mad at them and even after explained they was very sympathetic and just sort of wanted to do their own thing um and tried to go out with them tonight after got off from work because really felt better after working for two hours and like sort of exhausting myself and so we went to sort of party but they just didn't wanna keep doing they and sort of forced me along with what they wanted to do um which is fine but also not what had in mind and sort of like talked over me so can't really talk to other people because they manipulated the situation which sounds bad to say but that what they seems like they was doing so overall i'm like pretty upset and i'm pretty stressed out because have [inaudible] exam this week and i'm really not prepared and really didn't get any of my homework done because i've been upset about the stuff going on at home and the stuff with my roommate so ended up leaving [inaudible] ended up going to movie too because they wanted to see some guys they liked so they [inaudible] with them but didn't wanna do they so ended up leaving and talking to my mom and my sister for while and then deciding to go to urgent health services which don't know what exactly i'm gonna tell them but at least something will help just don't wanna keep getting upset and crying and they hard because feel like can't be in my own room since have roommate but i'll talk to people at health services and see how they go so hopefully it'll end up getting better 
19,today overall went really well woke up pretty late and [inaudible] 'cause had trouble sleeping last night but was able to spend the day relaxing still got to watch movie with friends and we ordered some pizza and had some other snacks needed to run to the store to get few things needed lot of school supplies and then was able to work on my homework for while 'cause had kind of lot but it fairly easy to understand and was able to get help on the stuff that didn't understand and so hopefully i'll get all that done not too late and still have little bit of time to relax um also felt lot better today because heard that my grandmother was able to go home from the hospital so that was good and talked to lot of my family members back home and my older sisters who are also off at school and we talked about all going home for thanksgiving which would be nice um other than that i'm pretty sore from work um because haven't been able to see chiropractor but hopefully will have time this week some time to schedule to be able to go and then i'll definitely feel better after that and think it could be next weekend uh some of my friends and are gonna go shopping for winter clothes because hopefully it will be getting colder soon and other than that the only things i'm really worried about are the test that have on wednesday but should have enough time to prepare for it between tomorrow and tuesday so we'll see how it go 
20,today was really easy didn't get too much sleep last night but still was awake enough to participate in class and do pretty well um so just went to my class and got my work done and had time to start on some homework that due later in the week and had little bit of time to study for my test on wednesday and plan to study for while tomorrow in preparation for that same test um had meeting with my professor about math which felt was really helpful to making sure that i'm preparing well for the upcoming assignments and for the algebra gateway retake so that went really well um finally got around to getting some of my reading done [just] for for my other class and should be getting that back [with] some grades later in the week which should give me better idea about my standing and how well i'm doing in my class so far have few other assignments that are also gonna be due this week but hopefully after the test on wednesday i'll have plenty of time to work on them um do have two work shifts that i'm not too excited about but i'll get them done and they'll probably take like two hours each so won't be too bad and one will be good amount of money and other than that need to set up meeting with my academic advisor and really need to set up meeting with huhs to see about going to chiropractor so we'll see how the week goes 
21,today woke up late so thought about skipping class but in the end got ready and went but it was worth it because needed to take notes of the material to be prepared fully during the week um after class had to sneak off to my room and started doing some homework um and was really was really bit worried about test that have tomorrow because haven't really had time to study for it over the weekend sort of lot of drama [inaudible] so really didn't get much studying done and then yesterday had some other stuff that had to do so couldn't study for it then and then today tried to study for it in all of my free time but got lot of information from the people back home which took bigger portion of my day and had to leave to do few other things for some different class and there was also some more drama with my roommate and it was her sort of interrupting while i'm trying to study and things like that that make it more difficult for me to focus and actually get it done so feel pretty unprepared for the exam but i'm just gonna go to bed and try and get good night sleep and do the best that can on the exam tomorrow it is the first exam so should be able to do better later in the semester or try and make up for it if don't do so well tomorrow um and maybe next time i'll take more time [inaudible] the office hours or do do the exam prep sessions so we'll just have to see in the end how it go so the rest of the week is looking pretty busy as well 
22,today overall has been all right woke up little bit late so didn't has as much time to get ready for my exam as wanted um the exam overall went okay but do wish had studied little bit more because there was one problem specifically that hadn't had time to look over so i'm pretty sure didn't do it correctly um but guess we'll just see how it goes and it is only the first test so hopefully it will still work out okay um managed to get quite bit of my homework done because has long work shift tomorrow so wanted to make sure finished it [inaudible] so i've spent the majority of my day doing homework and it was pretty nice because now feel lot less stressed about tomorrow um also managed to actually goes to the dining hall for lunch and dinner so made sure to eat good meal and i've had time to hang out with my friends as well um probably gonna stay up little bit later to watch show together but it shouldn't be too bad 'cause can sleep in little bit later 'cause don't has class right away in the morning um so i'll see how it goes i'm also going to see my counsellor tomorrow so that should hopefully help me feel better about some things going into this weekend because still has quite few responsibilities so and heard little bit from people back home today but not as much as would has liked to they're still being really supportive and my sister will be flying up here in like 10 day so i'll get to see her and spend some time with her which should help quite bit so 
23,today was definitely busy day um woke up on time to get ready and go to class but was little frustrated um just because of how my roommate woke me up um class went just fine and had section and everything that went well got good grade back so was pretty happy about that um was little bit frustrated um just because won't know about some other grade until tomorrow and i'm really worried about them and then was so stressed out that ended up missing doctor appointment that had so had to reschedule it for next week and had really long work shift that ended up working from 630 to 1130 and coming back finishing my homework then just staying up for bit to shower and unwind so i'm going to be pretty late but don't have too many class tomorrow just have lot of appointment and things that have to get done tomorrow and saturday but i'm planning also for downtime to relax on saturday as well going to game with my friends um and today was good because talked to some new people and went to dinner with new friends so sort of changed my routine which was nice to have some different people to talk to um probably also need to clean bunch this weekend because my room is pretty messy but we'll see how it go 
24,today went fairly well was little bit stressed out about test that didn't do as well as i'd like to on but also got another assignment back from another class that scored much better on than thought would which sort of brightened my day and had meeting with my academic adviser and he really helped me to see that the one bad test grade doesn't really matter that much because can make it up and it wasn't even that bad it was just that felt poorly about it um also had meeting to go check in for [inaudible] and that went really well and then had meeting with [inaudible] so not chiropractor so she gave me some tips and then referred me to physical therapy but won't be able to go until like the 16th so might try and get another appointment with some actual chiropractor for sooner than that um i'm pretty sore doesn't feel too well because i've had too many work shifts which i'm gonna have to do two work shifts tomorrow morning um and also wanna go to the game with some friends so we'll see how that go because have to get everything done between 800 and before 1200 since the game at 1200 and so guess if doesn't finish my work in time i'll just have to go to the game late so i'll be getting up pretty early but tonight i'll be relaxing with friends and we got some food to eat so it should be really nice 
25,today was okay woke up and had an early shift with work um wasn't feeling too well 'cause fell on an stairs the other day so my other job they let me just take this week off um sent message to my healthcare provider to see about going to see chiropractor so can hopefully get that taken care of so that they will be easier to walk around and make they to classes all week long have quite few assignments over the weekend but really didn't get any of them done today spent part of the day working and spent part of the day at the game and then spent the rest of the day pretty much cleaning my room and then going to the birthday party of friend which was all right but pretty stressful just 'cause they was very social environment and my roommate and aren't exactly getting along um so they does an stuff that make me feel really anxious and out of place which made they worse but for bit was separated and got to talk to few other people in my [entryway] which was nice and then left early to come back to my room and have an alone time to sort of destress tomorrow i'm planning on getting up early and just focusing on homework for while but i'm really looking forward to this weekend 'cause my sister will be coming and so hopefully it'll be better 
26,today slept in late and spent most of the day by myself my roommate wanted to go do few things but really just felt like being alone um didn't really feel like doing much work so just worked on art for while to help myself relax [finished] some some assignments um and then toward the end of the evening actually did my work and got quite bit of it done was able to concentrate so well because spent most the day alone didn't have any other distractions in the room with me my week is looking pretty busy um tomorrow in particular my [inaudible] full and have some upcoming exam thursday night but feel like i'm pretty well prepared for it uh i'll but i'll have to drop shift at work in order to be able to take it so hopefully my manager gets back to me about that sometime soon because i'll need to know um other than that i'm really looking forward to this weekend because my sister is coming to visit but i'm not looking forward to friday 'cause have major assignments due and i'm still really not sure how to start it so i'll probably gets that started tuesday evening and just see how it go from there have few other assignments due this week but nothing as major as the one that due friday so we is trying to [inaudible] that one my priority and hopefully the other assignments won't take me too long 
27,today woke up on time and made it to all of my classes which were pretty much just what expected um kind of [have] lot of assignments due this week but i've been keeping up with it okay today didn't really get much done because have so many classes that it makes me really not feel like doing any work even had to start another classes today were the first meeting that lasted an hour and it give me two more hour of work outside of classes which means i'll be pretty busy have work friday night and saturday morning and i'm planning on working tomorrow for my other job have test on thursday but feel like i'm pretty ready for it um today were nice 'cause went to lunch with an different people from my entryway that don't normally hang out with um it went fine and then had classes and friend from the that classes that went to and made plans to go and get lunch together on wednesday so it'll be someone else to hang out with as well and went to counseling today which were really nice i'm going back again on thursday so hopefully that'll help and were really glad 'cause got to talk on the phone with someone from back home for while so we'll see how everything go 
28,this morning woke up on time to even go get breakfast [before] class so it started out better than it usually does um my day was fairly busy almost forgot had an evening class but then remembered and still managed to make it on time was little bit out of it and i've just sort of been depressed so really wasn't able to does my homework and my roommate kind of made that worse and complained about me not spending time with them so instead of doing my homework decided to spend time with my roommate which resulted in me not finishing my homework until 300 in the morning and going to bed late because have an 800 am class so [inaudible] right now and know that i'm gonna have to work really hard tomorrow to make up for it since i've quite few assignments due this week and still have test um thursday evening that i'm not really ready for but think think it should still be all right even if don't study as much as wanted to managed to work an today which was really nice and thursday have an appointment with my counselor which should be good and my sister coming this weekend so hopefully the week will start looking up just need to actually go to bed on time so we'll see 
29,today was difficult ended up waking up almost late for my class um but still managed to get there on time and class went alright thought about skipping one 'cause was really tired but went anyway and then later came back and napped and then managed to get to my other class in time and then spent the after the afternoon by myself which was nice but at the same time feel like i've sorta gotten more down and haven't been focused on [inaudible] really fully doing my homework or pay attention in class which is bad because this week is pretty busy but think [inaudible] helping [inaudible] with my roommate [inaudible] making it worse because when [inaudible] it makes me not wanna do my work and it constantly want to do other things like watch tv when really need to be concentrating it makes it hard for me to focus um i'm going to counseling tomorrow so that should help but i'm just [inaudible] really anxious and depressed so we'll see i'm really hoping that my sister coming this week it'll help and talked to my grandmother on the phone today for bit which was nice but then was super more stressed from home from my mom with some trouble that been going on with my dad and my brother so overall i'm pretty stressed out and i'm thinking about going to bed without finishing my work and was trying to get it done tomorrow before have to go to class so i'm gonna see how it go and hopefully can go to bed sometime soon 'cause my roommate currently in there watching show so we'll see how long it takes before i'm able to go to sleep 
30,today was all right um didn't really get enough sleep again so was kinda falling asleep in class but it turned out okay and was happy because got like good grade on paper um got lot of stuff due uh tomorrow which is why stayed up so late tonight and didn't even finish it all and so i'm just gonna email one of my tfs and the other one is not due until 900 pm tomorrow so hopefully i'll find some time to finish it i'm worried about getting up on time for class but know that can probably drag myself there on time so it should be okay overall um [inaudible] this evening which didn't go as well as wanted it to but definitely better than the last one um just have to get through tomorrow and then i'll have the weekend so should be able to relax little bit and have doctor appointment about going to see chiropractor so [inaudible] definitely help me with my overall stress and should [hem] me help me start feeling lot better uh physically as well as mentally so we'll see how it go 
31,this morning woke up and didn't feel too well so went back to sleep and ended up sleeping through all of my classes um which was unfortunate but went to the doctor and got note so it should work out just fine where can get grades and things missed excused and also have friends in all of the classes that can give me the note that missed and things like that um did spend the day doing some homework and then had actual work later in the evening so still felt pretty productive after went to the doctor and got referral to some actual chiropractor so hopefully can go sometime next week because called this evening but it didn't call me back um we'll see and have pre-midterm next week which i'm little bit worried for but there study session that can go to with some friends so should just be able to do that to prepare for it and other than that don't really have any major assignments that are due so should turn out just fine 
32,today had shift of work so woke up pretty early um it was kinda difficult because it was raining and there was quite few people out in the yard still um but managed to make it through uh after that basically spent the day cleaning up my room and trying to get some stuff organized and taking shower um and then later my sister came in and we went to concert together which was really nice but i'm still having some issues with my roommate don't know she just been acting weird and i'm really stressed about school stuff so don't wanna deal with [personal] issues but still managed to relax at the concert 'cause had really awesome time it really made me feel great and tomorrow i'm gonna get up early know have lot of work to do so already have plans to work with some entryway mates and to go shopping with another friend so hopefully can get quite few things done and then be ready for the week which is gonna be pretty busy have quiz on monday and test on tuesday so we'll see how everything go 
33,today overall didn't go too well um woke up pretty late and spent the whole day trying to do homework but really couldn't focus and get any of it done and ended up getting some news from home that made me pretty upset so was just trying to avoid being upset um cleaned few things up tried to relax little bit but i'm really behind on my school work so had to email some of my tfs and try to [inaudible] few friends and in the end went to go and talk to my proctor about some stuff that been going on lately and it said that it was gonna forward the information to [inaudible] and that she could contact my teachers and everything and sort of let them know what going on also really need to go to the chiropractor but haven't heard back from them um so i'll be calling again tomorrow to try and set up some appointment for some time this week and hopefully they're resolved and also have two work shifts this week which shouldn't be too bad overall and have quiz tomorrow that i'm pretty worried about i'm not really sure how it gonna go and then have test on tuesday that i'm also really worried about so i'll just have to see how everything turns out but looks this week will be pretty busy am planning on going to get [inaudible] from the bureau of study counsel so hopefully that'll help with some of my class anxiety

37,today woke up on time went to my classes um felt like they went pretty well was had chiropractic appointment which was okay and definitely felt better after going to they didn't have headache anymore but then was late to my counseling appointment which wasn't good 'cause won't be able to see her for another two weeks and i've definitely been more emotional lately and have lot more going on think i've missed few classes and things like that but am getting tutor so hopefully that will help uh there some drama back home heard from friend who having really tough time but was really glad that they reached out to me because care about her lot so even if have lot going on i'd still wanna be able to be there for her um we have some people staying in my room visiting but they not too bad and they'll be leaving tomorrow and i'll be busy basically all day long so won't [have to deal with them] much had really tough work shift so i'm definitely physically exhausted and emotionally exhausted so i'm really glad they the weekend and i'm really glad we have long weekend holiday so hopefully i'll be able to actually like catch up on some reading and get some shopping and stuff done with friend so 
38,today woke up on time for my class um [inaudible] managed to make it all to all of my class was pretty tired though so after finished took nap and was supposed to make it to work but didn't so i'll just do my hours tomorrow instead um stayed up way too late 'cause we had friend over 'cause have an early work shift tomorrow but think it was still okay um had an okay time with the friend and everything but i'm still having an issues overall and won't be able to go back to counseling for two weeks um so we'll just have to see how it go but did reach out to an of my family and sort of talked through an of the issues with them which definitely helps little bit and went to get an shopping done that i've been meaning to get done which was really glad about uh have quite bit of homework and reading to do over this weekend but it also long weekend which should helps and i'm meeting with tutor tomorrow for the math and should be getting science tutor sometime soon so that should definitely helps me catch up and feel more on top of my studies so should be all right 
39,today was all right went and worked both jobs um spent quite bit of time doing my homework and also got to relax little bit because no one was home we was gonna have party night but then we didn't so i'm just spending some time in my room working on art which is really relaxing um met with the math tutor and that went really well got my psat done so was happy about that but then later got my pre-mid-term grade back and it wasn't as great as wanted it to be which was sad but can do corrections and make better grade and now i'll be working with the tutor so hopefully i'll do better in the future and tomorrow i'm planning on getting up pretty early and going shopping with friend so that should be pretty nice other than that um talked to some of my family back home because i've been pretty upset about my cousin and few other things and it helped especially since won't be able to go to my counselor for two weeks so talking to people at home really helps um but also got to talk to my friend that haven't spoken to since basically since left home and moved here so that was really fun and we made plans to hang out over christmas break when we're both home um and talked about some of my other friend so hopefully we'll all get together think really can't wait for break to be able to see everyone again back home and take some time with the friend that i'm i'm used to and i'm close with so 
40,today was fine um slept way too late last night so woke up kind of late this morning and spent basically the entire day out shopping with friend of mine um spent little bit more money than wanted to it was all basically essential stuff so feel okay about it still um was pretty tired from all of that so came back slept for bit then did laundry which was frustrating because the dryer broke so my clothes didn't get dry so had to hang them all over my room um then spent the rest of the evening with my friend and we watched some scary movies which kind of freaked me out and then my roommate got back home way later and was sort of weird about it but didn't really [inaudible] and then um another friend was nice enough to come over and hang out with me so we ended up staying up too late again and have quite bit of homework need to get done and i'm pretty upset about the grade on my um pre-midterm but my teacher emailed me about meeting and trying to go over the problems so i'll do that and then we're gonna try and arrange to meet with my um tutor because she should be able to help me with some of it as well so hopefully it'll turn out all right 
41,today basically just stayed in my room all day working on homework um got to sleep in little bit which was nice and my [inaudible] just checked in to see how was doing talked to some friends from back home and some family members from back home which was pretty nice um other than that am little worried about the week it pretty busy have lot of appointments and just realized double-booked some time next week so have to try and get that sorted i'm only working two shifts for one of my jobs which isn't too bad so i'm [inaudible] don't have to cover anything and other than that i'd really like to have monday off because it like don't know more time to relax and should have focused on homework little more but it won't be too hard to catch up during the week uh i'll just be pretty busy so i'll see how it goes i'm planning on getting up pretty early tomorrow um so can turn in my homework before going to class [hopefully] i'll make it on time to turn in my homework after class so it not too big deal so it should turn out all right 
42,today went really well was on time to class was able to talk to one of the guys from my class about my presentation so felt pretty good about that thought it was gonna be really bad but hope not so just have to wait on that one longer went to the chiropractor and the doctor see is really awesome we talked for while and she gave me some tips on how to stay in better shape um and my back and everything feels lot better today um got to talk to my grandmother on the phone for while which was really nice and did stay up little bit too late doing homework but it just because i'm worried about presentation have on thursday i'm meeting with the tutor for the class tomorrow though so it should turn out all right um class today was really interesting and tomorrow have some early class that i'm not too excited about but it shouldn't be too bad also got to work with my math tutor today which helped lot and got set up with my science tutor which i'm excited about because feels like i'll start doing lot better in both of that class once begin meeting with the tutor so overall it been going pretty well and actually went out to dinner um for the first time in while to [inaudible] normally just stay in my room and eat so that was nice as well 
43,today went fairly well was few minutes late to class but it wasn't too bad and understood everything that it talked about during lecture which was really nice um also got back really good grade today which made me happy have presentation tomorrow that i'm little bit worried about but also met with the tf to go over it which made me feel little bit more confident about it and made some plans to study because have three tests next week with some other people who are in similar class to me um also have plans to hang out with friend on friday which should be nice and we should be having some people over um to our room tomorrow night and friday night and maybe on saturday and sunday so it looks like it will be pretty busy but it will be nice to relax and hang out with people while also still getting work done since midterms are next week um i'm pretty confident about one of our midterms the other two i'm kind of worried about but started going to tutor so that should help um also have counseling on monday which i'm looking forward to and have work shift tomorrow evening that i'm not super excited about but hopefully it won't be too bad and can get it done fairly quickly and still have time to do homework and hang out with some friend so and i'm not i'm pretty busy but i'm still finding time to relax because know otherwise i'll just get way too stressed out and not get anything done 
44,today was pretty good woke up on time for class um and got dressed up since had presentation today which also went really well um my tf really liked it hope get good grade um and started preparing for my midterms so feel little more confident in those um 'cause have three next week it will definitely be busy weekend i'm working two shifts so those should be fun but i'm going to get coffee with friend tomorrow which will be really nice so overall everything going pretty well i'm definitely gonna study lot in preparation for my midterms so hopefully they'll end up being just fine but we'll see other than those um have an appointment next week to meet with my advisor which will be really nice which just scheduled and then i'm also gonna make an appointment to get an points back on my math pre-midterms since didn't do super well on it but i'm doing better than expected in science stayed up way too lat-late tonight so debating skipping my 900 am tomorrow but if wake up on time i'll probably be going or just going to it little bit late i'll just have to get ready really quickly so hopefully i'll still make it because really need to stop missing those class i've already missed twice 
45,today was all right slept through my morning class 'cause slept too late last night but went to all of my other class which was really good and started preparing more for my midterms um spent some time shopping with my friends um we had little get-together tonight and got to hang out with one of my friends from my hometown we went out for coffee and then he came over later to hang out and it was really nice because haven't seen him in while and he just really good person to talk to and to be friends with um other than that we really didn't see anyone and probably stayed up way too late again 'cause have shift in the morning and then have [inaudible] [dorm crew] but should be able to get all of it done and then i'm really gonna focus on studying for midterms and my homework then i'm meeting with tutor on sunday and i'm meeting with the my advisor and probably the dean next week and have counseling session on monday that i'm looking forward to so just after after next week hopefully everything will calm down little bit because won't be as busy once finish all my midterms so then this week it will definitely be really stressful but then after that hopefully i'll get little break 
46,today was fine spent most of the day hanging out with friends um didn't really spend lot time doing homework and spent lot of time doing work work which still haven't even been paid for which is kind of frustrating 'cause could really use the money especially 'cause my friends wanna go shopping and don't really have the means to right now and still need to get winter coat and boots think i'm gonna have to quit one of my two jobs because it totally been too much lately um we went to party tonight which was fun but also just like still didn't really talk to anyone because it was like smaller get-together so hopefully in the future i'll go to bigger one um but it was still pretty enjoyable thing and have lot of midterms comings up so uh tomorrow i'm definitely gonna spend my day studying um hopefully don't sleep in too la-late i'm gonna set some alarms so that get up and have meeting with my proctor still meeting with my tutor and uh going to [inaudible] together so hopefully we'll do all of that and can get like caught up with my work and be little prepared because thought was prepared for some of midterms but then when looked up at the study guides realized that there some stuff that i'm really not ready for um feel like i'm falling behind in my classes little bit but like hopefully i'll catch up and just wanna get through these midterms and then it'll hopefully get better for while so hoping my roommate okay and i'm meeting with my counselor monday so can like talk thing through with her but really just think need to expand my circle of friends so we'll see how it go but tomorrow hopefully i'll i'll actually do like lot of work and everything 
47,today was fine uh some people to go [inaudible] one of the problems that for class which was really nice kinda struggled with another problems set for different class but in the the end figured it out pretty much uh with help from the friends studied little bit for my midterms should study more but spent more time catching up with friends that hadn't seen in while which was really nice because feel like that help me to be in better place mentally when hang out with some other friends um so it was really fun we got to bake and haven't been able to cook anything for at least like [half] year so it was pretty relaxing um other than that really slept in too today because was up really late last night so it makes sense and hopefully after get through this week everything will calm down because midterms will be over have [allowed] for around [inaudible] too and then the week is pretty busy overall with appointments and other things um suppose just need to power through it and then hopefully everything will calm down go back to more regular schedule where won't be as stressed 
48,today was my busy day um had lot of classes [since i'm in] lab which was fine but it was also [quite bad] because needed time to study and slept too late last night which do lot lately other than that getting ready for my test this week but have little bit of time tomorrow to prepare and even if we go [inaudible] have options to like make it better and find other ways to deal with stuff um so hopefully overall it won't be like too hard or anything um the rest of the week is still pretty busy but i'll just be relieved to be over with all my midterms by thursday and after that think i'll take few day to relax and then go back to studying so can be prepared for future assignments and the final which is like project coming up uh two mondays from now so i'll probably start working on that um during next week and my sister will be coming for parents weekend so definitely wanna finish early 
49,today was fine made it to all of my classes um was definitely pretty stressed out because have midterm tomorrow that i'm really not ready for but did well on my other test and i've been doing well [on other] [inaudible] even if do poorly on this midterm should still be fine for the semester overall especially if do better on the last two test we have and have two more midterm thursday also have work shift because couldn't get it covered and have two meetings thursday so thursday so thursday is definitely looking pretty busy and then friday is little bit calmer so i'll probably do work shift friday and then two work shift on saturday and then relax this weekend before diving back in and doing more work but it will have come down because i'll be finished with all my test after this week so hopefully everything will get better and got to talk to my counselor yesterday and made another appointment and i'm going to physical therapy next week so it should probably help me get better and think i'm gonna quit one of my jobs so have more time to focus on school and and allow me to work my other jobs because just got raise so if do like four hours there week i'll be making pretty good money and it won't stress me out as much as my second jobs do so hopefully that'll help and my meetings with my academic advisor should definitely help as well because he always very straightforward and gives really good advice so hopefully everything will get better just once i'm passed all this testing 
50,today was fine woke up on time and got to study little bit before my midterm um it went better than expected it to but not still too well had to [twist up] clues which went okay i'm just little tired and [not too focused] so um yesterday made it to classes and got quite bit of studying done so hopefully i'm fairly prepared for my midterm tomorrow um tomorrow going to be quite busy day but i've decided to get into the routine of going to bed at certain time and waking up at certain time so i'm going to be trying to go to bed at around 1200 and trying to wake up at around 730 every day and we'll see how that go so in the morning i'll have some time to prepare and get some breakfast and coffee maybe before finding my way to my first midterm of the day and then have some meetings and then i'll have my second midterm then work so it definitely busy day but it just today and then mean tomorrow that i'm probably gonna have to get through and then the week will be over so hopefully everything ends up just all right

59,today was fine made it to all my classes although it was little bit difficult 'cause uh injured my ankle and had to get around on crutches it definitely harder was almost late to few classes but my teachers [everyone] was very understanding have quite bit of work to do [inaudible] next weeks [inaudible] pretty busy to with major assignment due on monday i'm getting [inaudible] wednesday and have an exam on tuesday uh so have lab report due monday on top of my normal homework and test corrections but i'm meeting with my tutors this weekend which will definitely help out with all the homework aspect and i'm just hoping that my it get better quickly since it so hard to get around i'm um i'm probably not gonna go to [inaudible] tomorrow night 'cause i've already got quite few things planned since my sister in town [inaudible] [game] and an capella show and the orchestra so don't think i'm gonna make to dance as well because it'll hurt my ankle too much but today was really nice because got to relax after my classes and stay off it for while and then went shopping with my sister and we went out to eat so tried few new places and had an really delicious food which was really lovely [inaudible] been eating well since [inaudible] i'm really glad that she is here and that she'll be here until sunday morning so i'll probably get all my homework done on sunday but it'll be worth it to take break and to spend time with her while she here 
60,today was all right went to quite few events like the football game the fellowship was really awesome the orchestra was pretty good too little bit longer than wanted then went to party with my friends but they didn't wanna stay as late as did which kinda sucked but don't know maybe next weekend we can stay out little bit later 'cause was having pretty good time um other than that know have lot of homework to do tomorrow so might go to bed and i'm probably gonna get up around 1000 1030 'cause have an appointment at 1100 with my tutor to go over an [inaudible] stuff know i've definitely stayed on my ankle little bit too much this evening but hopefully it'll get better pretty quickly and i'm gonna ice they when go to bed which should help little bit at least um other than that think i'm gonna try and make an more friends 'cause really want people than can like trust to go out with and have quite few assignments due on monday so i'll be doing quite bit of homework tomorrow but past that need to plan for thanksgiving 'cause i'll be going to stay with my sister and her boyfriend instead of going home 'cause they too expensive to go home but just kinda regret they because wish could just be here having good time with good friends that trust so really need to find an people that actually trust but don't know how that'll happen 'cause i'm too anxious but hopefully my counselor will help me with they so we'll see how they go 
61,today wasn't feeling too well so spent most of the day relaxing woke up pretty early showered met with my tutor to go over some stuff which was nice but then after that kind of just laid around for while and ended up taking nap because i'm not feeling well um my foot is really hurting so tomorrow think i'm gonna try [inaudible] so that it'll be little bit easier to get around [inaudible] won't be as difficult [inaudible] to so hopefully it'll just be fine like that hopefully my [foot] will get better pretty soon because i'm mean i'm taking medicine which helps and if it doesn't get better then [inaudible] um other than that do have quite bit of homework to do tomorrow um as had lot tonight that didn't really finish [inaudible] since spent most of the day laying around but [inaudible] 'cause have some assignment due by 900 pm i'm thinking about skipping one of my classes to work on it but think i'll probably still go to classes and then just try and get it done 'cause should still have about five hours [and it only like] two pages so it shouldn't be too difficult to finish um other than that i'm kinda busy this week but it shouldn't be too bad hopefully [inaudible] [will be] easier before it get harder

64,today was fine got back midterm that did really well on so was super happy about that and have kind of lot of homework but managed to get it done and got started on few other things do have test tomorrow that i'm little bit worried about but should have time to study before it um 'cause only have two other classes to go to um and in my other classes i'm gonna try and get up early in the morning so can finish some extra readings for that but it my favorite classes so it won't be too bad today was pretty tired so did end up sleeping through one of my other classes but hopefully can make up the work for it tomorrow night and my ankle is still hurting pretty bad so i'll probably try and do my shift with my work on either friday the day after my last classes or saturday um friday night i'm also going to friend concert which is gonna be really fun and had dinner with her this evening so i'm super excited about being able to go i'm gonna see her again on friday 'cause dinner tonight was really nice um and talked while with my family back home and tried to make some concrete plans for thanksgiving so hopefully get paid for my other job soon so can buy train ticket to go see my sister 
65,today had my favorite class which was really nice um and also made an appointment with huhs tomorrow to go get my foot looked at since it still been hurting other than that um had test this evening and think it went fine probably could have done better if looked over an more stuff but don't think that it [inaudible] test so hopefully still did okay though um got my homework done pretty quickly and stayed up watching an tv when really should have been working on an other stuff other than that found out that might actually be going home for thanksgiving which i'm pretty excited about um but still have to work out few of the details with my family and i'm also super happy 'cause i'm going to the [inaudible] with friend tomorrow so that'll be lots of fun 
66,today woke up late and ended up sleeping through my first class but it shouldn't be too bad because can definitely make it up pretty easily since the lecture is recorded online um went to all of my class did quite bit of my reading and started some of my homework for this weekend so i'd say my day was really productive and also [inaudible] [to address] something in my special shoe where sprained my foot don't know how much i'm really going to wear it though because it not super comfortable and have work tomorrow so i'm definitely not going to wear it during work but i'll probably only do about two hours since my foot hurting so i'll just have to fulfill the requirement and then i'll probably spend the rest of the day trying to do homework and then have plans to go to some acapella show tomorrow evening and some of the people in my [inaudible] is going to be in it tonight or tomorrow is the performance but girl from my [dorm crew] was in it and it was super good and it was [inaudible] because went with my friend from back home and haven't seen him in few weeks so that was definitely fun and we made sort of made plans to go to the december one together as well so i'll be looking forward to that and i'm excited because think i'm going to get to go home for thanksgiving now and didn't think was going to so hopefully everything will work out and i'll figure out all my thanksgiving plans soon and i'm going to try and go winter clothes shopping sometime soon as well maybe this weekend 
67,today woke up late and my foot was really hurting so ended up not going to work and texted my manager but she didn't answer which was little bit frustrating um really wasn't feeling good so kind of just relaxed at home did leave to go to [redacted] and to go pick up some bagged food from the dining hall um which was nice because their bagged lunches are really great and even ordered one for tomorrow morning so hopefully can [just] pick it up on time um i'm also hosting someone but it interesting 'cause she stays out late and doesn't respond which means that have to stays up later than want to as well but she leaving tomorrow so it shouldn't be too bad um tomorrow i'm gonna start tutoring which will definitely help with some of my homework um then the week gonna be super busy but i'm super excited 'cause i'll be getting to go home for thanksgiving now which will be really nice 
68,was hoping to get in today but woke up and wasn't feeling too well my throat really sore so think might be getting sick now and i'm gonna try and go to bed early 'cause finished all my homework pretty early which will be nice 'cause i'm i'm probably gonna have trouble waking up tomorrow so just haven't been feeling well um tomorrow also my really busy day so it kind of sucks that i'm gonna be sick when have the most classes and the most stuff to do also have meeting tomorrow at the [bsc] and i'm still waiting to get back some news of the test which hopefully went well um think it went okay think it could've gone better but still think i'm okay um some of the homework had little bit of trouble with but still finished all of it so i'm still feeling pretty proud of myself for finishing um and other than that i'm looking forward to my on tuesday there are some classes and i'm happy because started doing packed lunches with [hohs] and with um [heds] so i've been able to actually eat food quite bit more like got the hummus and beef and it wasn't as good as back home but it was still pretty good and um ordered lunches for tomorrow as well so can make sure that continue eating when don't have time to actually sit down and have lunches in the dining hall so i'll probably continue to use them because it really great service and hopefully my foot get better and my throat will get better soon because i'm really tired of being sick 
69,today was my busy day um finished with [inaudible] sort of on time read it pretty quickly and was almost late to turn it in because [inaudible] but still managed to make it which was good um perhaps it fine went to bed early last night 'cause wasn't feeling well but was definitely feeling better today i'm still not 100 i'm definitely better than was yesterday um [inaudible] so life is getting better and my manager replied so went to see [inaudible] work which was nice um was little stressed out because found out that have two tests next week and thought only had one and [inaudible] just gonna to try [inaudible] also have lot of papers coming up that we should be getting an assignment for either tomorrow or thursday um i'm supposed to have meeting today but it canceled in the last minute so had to reschedule that for wednesday and have two more meeting tomorrow um one with physical therapy which will be interesting because it will be my first time working with them and the other with my counselor which was really nice since i've begun to see them [inaudible] um hopefully we can be productive 'cause normally we run out of time to talk about things um other than that talked to my mom today which was really nice 'cause she looking forward to coming home for thanksgiving um so just my grandmother [inaudible] [out] and surprised them but [inaudible] tell them checking the news definitely made them happier and [inaudible] can [inaudible] something to look forward to 'cause really need break from the atmosphere and the people here but uh i'm trying to [inaudible] tomorrow when we get breakfast but don't have time but depending on how feel in morning might just decide need the extra sleep so we'll see 
70,today didn't wake up as early as wanted but still woke up in plenty of time to get to class and class was super interesting so was really glad um after that had little bit of time to do my reading and eat pretty good lunch um because still have food from the packed lunch i've been getting ordered two for tomorrow but won't be able to pick them up until one o'clock because of my busy schedule which is little annoying but it fine um whatever um other than that had meeting with my therapist which was really awesome really enjoy talking to them and she always understands me um and had meeting with pt for the first time which was definitely bit of struggle but think it'll be really nice to start building up more strength and feel more comfortable and confident with myself um especially because it going to help my back and think overall i'm going to be lot happier and it'll make it lot easier to function in everyday life um what else have two tests next week which am not too thrilled because don't feel like i'm ready for either of them got tests back today um but didn't do too great on it so we'll just see how it goes mean should have time to study over the weekend and can meet with my two groups of friends to help so that will be nice 
71,today was fine and i'm definitely getting sick so ended up sleeping through my first period class um but it-it definitely not gonna be like too hard to make up because they have the lectures online and everything um so they okay that um stay and still went to all my other class was at meeting with the [redacted] state council which was pretty nice and they had some good tips on how to prepare because have two exams next week that am totally gonna need lot of time to study for um stayed up little too late trying to work on [inaudible] assignment that i'm not exactly fond of but definitely have time to finish they tomorrow um just have to focus and get they done and tomorrow only have uh two no three class um so they won't be too bad to go to all of them even though i'm not feeling well probably just won't be able to talk as much which won't be too bad but do have some questions for my tf so hopefully can still talk enough to ask them questions i've just been drinking lot of tea and doing lot of cough drops to try to make they better but think also need to get some medicine so might try and run by the store tomorrow if have time to get some honey and some medicine and maybe some more cough drops and maybe some soup um 'cause being sick definitely they not but luckily have off work this week because sprained my ankle um so hopefully i'll be better before have to go back to work next week and before have all of my exams next week and i'm gonna try and sleep they off little more this weekend 
72,today was not the best i've gotten really sick and basically lost my voice uh had trouble in classes and i'm just not feeling well so was having trouble doing [inaudible] 'cause really just wanted to lay around and not do anything but [inaudible] tomorrow um so hopefully can get that taken care of and and sleep i'm gonna sleep in tomorrow and not go to my first classes 'cause keep waking up from coughing and i've had like three nose bleeds now so don't don't wanna like go to classes and then get nose bleeds in the middle of classes um so i'm probably have to go to [inaudible] to make up but feel like that the better option it not [inaudible] trying to go to classes while feel horrible um so i'll probably email my professor tomorrow evening there one classes that have to go [inaudible] section but it only an hour um really don't have to talk that much so that should be okay uh other than that talked to my tutor today about getting one of my assignments rescheduled um and he said he'll try work on it which will be nice 'cause was pretty worried about it and then i'm just really glad that it getting closer to me being able to go home for little bit which i'm really looking forward to feel like definitely i'm gonna need the break and the separation from people here um but to get to that point do have to get through two more exams next week and lots and lots of homework this weekend but hopefully it'll be okay and i've got long paper that [inaudible] working on so it definitely getting getting busy 
73,this morning wasn't feeling well so so ended up sleeping in and missing all three of my classes and then went to [inaudible] and they said that have bronchitis so i'm taking me some prescription medicine which will hopefully help but now have even more work to make up this weekend which sucks because also wanted to like have fun do some stuff but guess i'll really have to focus on my homework i'm definitely looking forward to thanksgiving break so think just need to power through next week and get all my shit done so over thanksgiving break can relax for bit and take some time off 'cause will still probably be sick for while and hopefully my teachers will be understanding 'cause was up coughing most of the night which was why slept in and missed my classes i'm probably gonna try and schedule meetings with my tutors uh gonna try and actually get up on time tomorrow 'cause i'm probably gonna be tired but i've got to [inaudible] so definitely got to drag myself out of bed feel like i'll definitely feel better since spent today resting mostly so hopefully tomorrow won't be too bad maybe i'll start to get my voice back which will be really nice 
74,was still sick today so woke up early from nosebleed kept feeling pretty bad on and off all day long um um called [redacted] again but they really didn't tell me anything different so i'm just gonna have to [wait] till they gets better if they doesn't go can um find bit of work to do tomorrow since haven't done anything since haven't been feeling well um 'cause have all of sudden [inaudible] things like that but hopefully i'll be able to figure they out and gets they done even though am basically pretty sick um [inaudible] run to the stores but other than that didn't really [inaudible] my bed for that matter 'cause resting and gets over they [the best] so suppose my [inaudible] is resting 
75,today was my pretty busy day um 'cause have lot of homework that needed to get done and lot of stuff to prepare for during the week but it was definitely really difficult since hadn't been feeling well and i'm still not up to 100 um [inaudible] back to being able to talk [inaudible] normal voice compared to earlier in the week but i'm still having pretty bad cough and stuffiness and it definitely [inaudible] my homework tackled as i'm having lot of trouble being able to focus and think things through and don't think [inaudible] because feel too [inaudible] to like [inaudible] and probably should have been definitely had difficulty completing and understanding my work um i'm definitely behind but hopefully as get to feeling better can get [back] caught up 'cause have two tests [inaudible] this week so i'm definitely really busy this week [inaudible] myself to get through and [inaudible] go home and take break during thanksgiving so just gotta get through this week 
76,today was great i'm still feeling pretty terrible did get back [inaudible] slightly better but have two tests coming up [inaudible] quite bit of homework and two more major assignments due next week so i'm stressed out and i'm still sick and today it kinda got worse and still went to all my classes anyway but right after that came home slept for long time which definitely put me behind my work so ended up staying up later to make up for it and know tomorrow gonna be really busy because my first exam of the week is gonna be on wednesday and have few practice [exams] need to take on top of the homework for other classes things like that um but hopefully tomorrow i'll be back on time because this morning woke up late and was supposed like [to do] my homework but have later classes tomorrow morning so guess can still sleep in little bit and be on time and ordered food so that will actually eat tomorrow um [would like] to go so that can go back to my room and try to focus and work on quite few things 'cause need to do homework during the day and then at night can study for my exam that on wednesday so just need to stick to that plan but have it gonna be hard 'cause also have an appointment with physical therapy tomorrow and haven't been able to do my exercises since i've been sick but um it should still be okay 
77,today was all right um was almost late to class but managed to make it on time um throat still [hurting] don't have time to go to huhs like i'm starting to lose my voice again which sucks um did have to go [go through] some therapy today which was tiring but pretty good [inaudible] which is nice 'cause [inaudible] and my [back] isn't doing as bad [inaudible] some exercises today um have test tomorrow and then test on thursday and bunch of assignments due [inaudible] overall [inaudible] gonna have to shop for my sister birthday 'cause i'm home for thanksgiving have to give her present and have to go to the grocery store as well so we'll see if can get everything done on time hopefully will be able to 
78,today was all right um had to wake up early because had test um but think it went slightly better than thought it was gonna go feel pretty confident that at least passed so that good um was annoyed because [i've had] emailed extra work for class tomorrow like tonight that i'm not ready to do um which definitely sucks because sort of had busy night with lots of work and i'm just extra stressed um so i'm gonna try and get that done tomorrow between class have test tomorrow night but think i'm gonna have to focus on other things which isn't necessarily the best idea however did prepare so that if did poorly again can do retest 'cause did extra work to ensure that so even if do poorly on the test tomorrow i'll have an opportunity to make it up which can definitely be nice think i'm getting slightly better [from being sick] but can't really tell um at least have [inaudible] back but kinda sucks 'cause was feeling good today so napped through one of my class that will be easy to make up for but still should've probably gone to lecture um but it okay i'm really happy 'cause have few days before [inaudible] [break] [inaudible] get to go home and see my family and take break so that'll be really nice just have to get quite few things done before can leave like shopping and packing and an assignments so we'll see how it go 
79,today went pretty well was busy but was also super grateful and had test this evening think it went better than thought that it would um talked to few of my family members today which was super nice because i'll be going home in five days and i'm really excited um made plans with friend to hang out tomorrow which should be lot of fun and then i'll still be getting errands done which is nice because have so many things to do before next week because have to prepare to go home and see everyone and take presents for some birthdays that have passed so i'll shop tomorrow have work tomorrow have class tomorrow and then have some major assignments due next monday but on saturday i'm going to the game so um probably won't do anything with that saturday but it okay because started some of my homework in advance tonight and and will probably start packing and some other stuff tomorrow night just to be extra prepared and ready to leave so i'm super excited for thanksgiving break it definitely time 
80,today was fine um woke up on time went to all my classes on time did really well in all three of them um and then went to work for two hours and had nice night with friend before came home and relaxed bit and did some homework because i'm going to the game tomorrow which will be basically all day long but then on sunday can work on some of my other homework 'cause i've got major assignments due monday and tuesday and just realized have test monday night um so quite bit of work done but after that i'll be able to relax and go home for while which will be super nice can't believe how close it is to the semester being over kind of insane but it should be all right still um hopefully mean and think i'm gonna pass all of my classes maybe not with as high grades as originally hoped but mean it period of adjustment so can always do better next semester and it only one semester of not so good grades so it doesn't matter too much and now i'll be better prepared for the future 
81,today started out well and ended up horribly um went to the game with good friend that don't get to spend lot of time with but my roommate was also there and some drama happened where we ended up getting separated and strayed with my other friend and we couldn't find my roommate so we headed back together and spent basically the whole day together and the evening and we did invite my roommate but she didn't wanna come so just hung out with my other friend and she super nice so we get along really well so we had really great time you know [inaudible] we watched [a few] movies and listened to music and she played guitar and then when came home ended up getting into some argument with my roommate over the cleanliness of the room and so the stuff that happened today has definitely really stressed me out especially because did come home with the intention of doing homework because i've got two major assignments due monday and tuesday and also has to prepare to leave for thanksgiving break on tuesday right after class so i'm not gonna has lot of time to work on that assignments otherwise um but just ended up spending most of the time arguing with my roommate so all got done was one of my science psets and still has my two major assignments due at least my little psets are done so we will try and still might get up kinda early tomorrow and finish up my two major assignments or 'cause one of them are due monday so can finish it tomorrow and get started on the second and then use some of monday to also work on the second but also need to pack and run few errands tomorrow so it'll definitely be busy day tried going to the proctors about the whole thing with my roommate but think i'm just gonna let it rest until after thanksgiving break and then see how it goes um especially since i'm going to see my therapist on monday as well so that'll probably help because she always has good suggestions on thing to do um so i'll talk to them about it bit and i'm thinking about asking them if can start taking anti-anxiety medication 'cause feel like that might help me um with lot of thing overall so we'll see how that goes and i'm also are are gonna has to set up meeting with my academic advisor which might try and schedule for monday but i'm not sure if need to work on monday so don't know yet if it'll work out the thing are i'll just figure everything out as it come up just really ready to be home and take break and see my family 
82,today was all right slept in um [inaudible] nice 'cause got some rest went shopping so got some more birthday gifts for family members back home and finished my assignment um that was due tomorrow night so can focus on my paper tomorrow 'cause only have three classes and meeting but the rest of the time i'll work on my paper 'cause finished the majority of my packing so i'll be ready to leave on tuesday but i'm kinda taking lot of stuff home so think that i'll probably just end up taking some uber to the airport other than that i'm [still fighting with my] roommate ['cause] she only came home for little bit today and haven't seen her since um but honestly don't have time to deal with it so i'm just gonna let her rest till after the spring break and [see how it goes] but can talk to my counselor about it tomorrow which will be nice other than that i'm just trying to focus on my school work 
83,today was good woke up on time although did have little bit of troubs trouble sleeping last night then made it to all my classes turned in my homework on time and felt like really understood what was going on um which was nice then had an appointment and did little bit of shopping guess the only trouble really had today was not being able to focus on this essay just 'cause it over lot and also had to pack and prepare to go home tomorrow but but stayed up little bit later to continue working on the essay and try to go to bed by 100 and then still have my whole um flight and time in the airport tomorrow to work on the essay as well which will be good like three or four hours and even if don't finish it can still work on it at home since it due at midnight and it is only eight pages double spaced um so should be able to finish it all um might just not be able to cover everything that initially wanted to cover but still think that it'll be fine that i'll make good grade on it so i'm not super worried about it i'm just really excited to be going home and see my family 
84,today was good day only had one class that had to go to before being able to leave and head back home which was super nice but did have to focus on my essay because didn't finish it before left but it was okay because took some time at the airport and on the plane to write it so it wasn't too bad did start to write little bit after got home but got it in on time and i'm feeling pretty confident about how it turned out um so that really good other than that i'm just really happy to be home with the fam again um went to see everyone had to go and see surprise my family members and stop by and even see my grandmother so i'm really excited and definitely have at least few day to not do or worry about anything and just get back into the routine of being at home um so i'm now really looking forward to relaxing 
85,today was my first full day of being at home and honestly it just so nice feels like such relief not to be at school dealing with drama and actually being able to take break for once um really enjoyed it and kinda felt like spent the day doing nothing but it was nice to just relax and not do anything and even in doing that still went to work with my family and helped out at the restaurant so didn't feels particularly productive but still managed to be little bit productive um and just made me look forward to christmas even more and having longer break and [they're] really helping me um with my [inaudible] school because i've been struggling little bit especially [inaudible] don't want to go back which is [inaudible] because of my roommate but can definitely talk to shawn and rachel was little bit disappointed with my friends here but [inaudible] my school friends was really great people so guess shouldn't let it bother me that much that i'm not really hearing from them because have all my family and i'll see even more family tomorrow and it'll kinda be hard because already know what type of questions they're gonna ask me about school and relationships but at the same time i'll be really grateful to see them because they're all super supportive and you can really just tell how much everyone cares about each other so looking forward to thanksgiving 
86,today was thanksgiving and it was all right got to see my family but some family members are not exactly pleasant to be around [at least] grandma bread still okay mean had all of the good food and got to spend time together um just feel sort of distanced from the rest of my family especially 'cause i'm not feeling well which my family members think probably have strep which are great because have lot of stuff need to do and i'm stressing about money 'cause need to get good winter coat and boots but really don't have the money for it and especially with the holidays coming up have so many family members that i'm gonna have to buy them all presents and it still makes me angry to think about how much spend on textbooks that i'm not even using now but um guess there not much can do about it so i'll just have to try and pick up few more hours when go back to school so hopefully won't be feeling sick for too much longer tomorrow think i'm gonna stay home and rest up for bit which mean anyway will suck but anyway will also be good because can hopefully get some stuff done that need to get done and even if can't get winter boots should be able to go for the winter coat so mean hopefully everything will work out in the end 
87,today spent the day doing basically absolutely nothing at home which was kind of nice to be honest um kept thinking about school work thought about doing some of it but never got around to it guess just didn't have the energy um but am feeling lot better than was so hopefully i'm finally over whatever was sick with this time 'cause i'm really tired of being sick and hopefully will stay feeling better my throat will be stop being sore by sunday when it time for me to head back to school um my family have been good but also little bit frustrating but that to be expected and tomorrow think i'm actually gonna have to get up and go into work um but i'm okay with that because should also be able to spend the day getting some stuff done mean today at least did order my winter coat so that should be arriving and hopefully it'll fit and it was pretty expensive um i'm definitely gonna need to work some extra hours at my job whenever get back to campus but that shouldn't be too bad 'cause classes am just about wrapping up so hopefully everything will be fine 
88,today was good just went to work and spent the day with my family because tomorrow am headed back to school um [inaudible] packing and doing the laundry getting ready for the day which means i'll probably be pretty tired tomorrow but should be able to sleep on the flight and still have time to work on my homework so it should turn out to be just fine and i'm looking forward to going back to school but we do only have little bit of time left which will be nice 'cause i'm ready for long break in comparison to the short thanksgiving break which was nice but long break will definitely be more fun am little bit stressed about finals 'cause have to try and take one early so that can catch my plane back home but i'm gonna try and talk to my tf about it this week hopefully it'll be okay i'm little worried because have tests monday and tuesday that i'm not necessarily ready for but hopefully it'll still go fine 
89,went back to campus today so [inaudible] and my dad traveling really didn't get much sleep last night 'cause my little sister was here [inaudible] so stayed up with her but didn't sleep [inaudible] then after we cleaned for little bit which was nice i'm [inaudible] okay but [inaudible] was not super productive um and when got back did get few things done [inaudible] 'cause wanted to seeing as have really busy day tomorrow and an early class and [inaudible] last night but hopefully will still be fine in getting everything done 'cause have test tomorrow and test the next day that i'm not necessarily prepared for but should have little bit of time throughout the day to study um between class and made sure to order foods that will actually eat and then just be able to go [inaudible] come back to my room to get an work done without worrying that i'm still definitely eating instead of not eating which will be good and i'm grateful for the packed lunch guess [inaudible] my life so 
90,today was all right woke up little bit late and was pretty exhausted all day long but still made it to class basically on time realized that this is actually our last week of class which was definitely surprised about because thought that we still had two week um have like [grade that was] not quite as good as was hoping but honestly better than expected it to be had really busy day tomorrow today and have pretty busy day tomorrow too kinda sucked 'cause like didn't really have the motivation to do our reading and know that should've but really have to have it done till thursday which isn't much of an excuse but should be able to do an of it tomorrow so that wednesday have another test tomorrow night um that don't feel prepared for can study for it tomorrow but just feel like i'm not gonna be ready i'd rather write um 'cause haven't really had lot of time to go over the material it still basically new um just go ahead [inaudible] one of our other friends that don't hear from anymore so that was cool [inaudible] really just can't wait to get this over with and go home for break for month off [inaudible] that will just be really nice and really need that time to recover man prepare for another semester which hopefully next semester i'll be doing better so 
91,today went really well got to class on time and it was really fun did okay on my test this evening got quite bit of homework done because worked on all the stuff that due tomorrow and some stuff that was due friday so that i'll have less to do on tomorrow and scheduled some appointment with the resident dean to make sure that i'll be able to take my final early um other than that i'm just really glad that this is the last week of class and i'm gonna start making plan on how to study during reading week um to try and make solid day-to-day of what plan on doing to prepare for all of my final and then it won't be too long i'll be back home again so i'm really happy and looking forward to it other than that actually had to go to [inaudible] today and to eat which was really nice because normally don't get to do that but that was little sad because missed the classroom to [inaudible] with my basically my favorite professor but i'm thinking might go to his office hours just to tell him how much enjoy being in his class because it was probably my favorite course this semester i'm also really looking forward to thursday 'cause that'll be my last day with having that specific course and i'm waiting on quite few grades one grades the especially for that class um 'cause it major assignment that we turned in right before thanksgiving break so hopefully it'll be getting back to us pretty soon 'cause other than my final and my mentoring that still great weekend class and then for my with my other class only have one more creative writing assignment to do which should be pretty good and especially because i've got um three out of the five back already and i'm making high in the class so so hopefully i'll get the fourth back this week and then i'll be able to tell with what need to do on the fifth to keep my grades some hopefully um so that was going really well and i'm pretty sure have really good feeling about my other class because could definitely pass everything maybe not with but all this passed which earlier in the semester wasn't so sure about 
92,today didn't exactly go well woke up late and missed my first class my second class was still pretty good though do have lot of work that need to get done before reading period starts which will be little bit rough um later in the day [i'm still] [inaudible] class that was also really nice 'cause it the last time had to meet for that class um but then had an important meeting about an financial stuff and an grade stuff that really stressed me out and ended up missing my section 'cause forgot what hour it normally occurs in just guess since was so stressed around about the other stuff that was going on at that time but [i didn't] think about which means i'm really behind in that class which isn't good because my finals are coming up and we're not gonna meet again so i'll have to try make up the work with someone that know um [inaudible] little better 'cause got an good news later in the day um but [inaudible] still in weird mood and had lot of trouble concentrating on homework that need to get done for tomorrow so feel like was super productive yesterday and not pretty productive at all today um especially as just like have not been feeling well so it been hard guess but hopefully will get over that 'cause still have to work shift this week so have quite few more class and doctor appointment before this week are over so hopefully everything will get better and surely i'll be able to wake up on time tomorrow to prepare little bit before class before have to go and prepare little bit for section before have to get to that 
93,today was fine woke up later than wanted to but still got to class on time it was my last lecture for my favorite class um and really enjoyed it then went to [section] was little bit disappointed because didn't really talk and wanted to but did talk to one of my classmates after we got out which was pretty nice and got back grade that i'm super proud of and started thinking about how to better prepare for the final um also got quite bit of money and scheduled some time for work um and prepared for my appointment tomorrow so have my last four class three class guess of the semester tomorrow and doctor appointment [inaudible] [relaxing] and even made plans this we for this weekend with friend of mine which should be fun so looking forward to that and hopefully i'll just wake up on time tomorrow [inaudible] to bed little later than wanted since spent some of the day doing some unplanned things like [going to dinner] with friend and going shopping and running to the bank um so taking me little bit longer to finish my homework than thought but but it should still be all right and i'm glad because got done [inaudible] really so that can just turn it in tomorrow and not think about it and just have few more assignments and makeup stuff to do and then can start focusing on finance and hopefully working few extra hours at my job 
94,today was the last day of classes so was pretty excited about that and then finished everything it was okay was late to my physical therapy appointment but it still went really well and really need to start doing the exercises but for the rest of the day just kinda felt [really] depressed and pretty much just laid around [inaudible] switch my work shift to tomorrow 'cause didn't have the motivation to get it done and i'm really worried that i'm gonna keep feeling like this 'cause really need to get motivated so that can do my finals and complete the year in positive manner but just don't really see that happening mean have few things set up for next week and i'm meeting with my therapist so hopefully that'll help and don't know how to tell her that think might be depressed and honestly just look at it as an inconvenience because don't have the time to spend on something like this but it is making me lay around and and do my work for hours which really interferes with my life as whole because could have accomplished lot today or even gone out with friends but just didn't do it and made myself feel like more isolated than usually am [inaudible] plans with friends on sunday so hopefully that'll help but i've just been really unsatisfied with everything lately which sucks because was having really good day yesterday and today is definitely low 
95,today just basically slept in relaxed for while and went to work did spend little bit of time working on through my pt exercises which was nice and did leave to go get some food so treated myself but think the food turned into not so good idea because ended up pretty sick so don't know if it just because of the fever or just because haven't been feeling well in general lately but that definitely was not fun and was gonna go hang out with friend but he lives pretty far away so decided not to 'cause the [t] wouldn't be running so i'd have to get lift back to campus which is expensive so decided not to do that also found out that might have some homework to do on monday that definitely did not know about um so i'm little bit worried about that but don't think it'll be too difficult to do just have to figure out how it get turned in so we'll see hopefully it won't be too hard other than that might start either one of my review guides or um my final [pre] for some exam tomorrow and hopefully my tf will email me back 
96,today slept in but slept little too late 'cause missed meeting with friend uh which was really upset about 'cause haven't seen him in bit and don't know if we're gonna get chance to hang out because we'll both be having fun also leaving for christmas break hopefully i'll get to see him sometime um other than that cleaned up the room bit and stuff but still didn't feel super productive 'cause didn't do any of my homework but don't really have anything to do until tuesday and wednesday so guess it won't be that bad but really need to get out of this little rut i'm in and start getting back to business because need to be prepared for finals um so hopefully i'll get over it sometime soon not really positive though um do have meeting tomorrow so i'll have to be see tomorrow when get up 'cause i've been staying up late and just sleeping in and then have meeting tuesday and wednesday so we'll see how everything goes 
97,today went pretty well woke up early and had an appointment [inaudible] and got an other stuff done and went shopping to get an healthy food in in preparation for final exams because there are few things that like to do to study certain way that works for me so bought all the stuff to prepare for that and then came back spent an time relaxing decorated my room little bit cleaned stuff up little bit to help me feel more relaxed and in control was planning on going to bed early but stayed up late because was hanging out with friend it was super nice so i'm still glad that did it and can sleep in little bit tomorrow as long as focus on my works after that because have an event want to go to an assignment due and another appointment and then have an appointment on wednesday that i'll spend tomorrow preparing for and other than that pretty much have an easy week um have to get started on my writing assignment it'll be due later but have plenty of time to works on it and i've already started thinking about it so i'm not super worried 
98,today was fine went to bed pretty late but still woke up on basically the time wanted to wake up got some work done and got it turned in and then even went to fair to go get some opportunities for next summer started planning for the future which is really nice 'cause ran into some people that knew um got to see them had appointment with my therapist that was really awesome it actually the last time went to see them before leave um and ran into friend today 'cause went out to dinner but also haven't seen them while so that was super cool and spent the rest of the afternoon getting little bit of work done and chilling um it been pretty relaxing have few things to do tomorrow that forgot about um which should still go okay um and then planned to start on some of my [inaudible] and major project that due monday so hopefully i'll be prepared for the finals 'cause i'm feeling okay about them right now 
99,today went by pretty quickly slept in little later than meant to but it was just good to take rest um had actually [inaudible] today so need to get [inaudible] and have to have enough for breakfast and lunch tomorrow saved in the fridge um also had meeting with my tf which was nice to prepare for one of my final exams that are coming up and i've started review sheet for one of my other classes so that should help to feel little bit more prepared i'm going to meet up with professor tomorrow even went to study break tonight with my entryway which don't normally do and it was fewer people than usual but i'm still pretty glad that went 'cause got to see my paf which was nice and got little bit [inaudible] [to apply] for [inaudible] i'll probably [inaudible] in my next semester and think it'll probably [inaudible] apply to few other things as well so i'll definitely [inaudible] so i'm getting out little bit more um tomorrow might also try and go to work um 'cause need to do my hours for this week [inaudible] weekend i'll probably try and go shopping for christmas stuff but have to [inaudible] [for food] 
100,today woke up and went to meet with the professor at about noon and we had short discussion which was truly lovely [inaudible] excited [inaudible] talked to him before uh so got back an assignment today that made really good grade on so was really pleased about that and went and did my work um so that been [inaudible] the week so can go do more hours if want but don't have to tomorrow i'll probably wanna try and get an christmas shopping done with my mom hmm and feel like an shopping [inaudible] true to myself and it will be nice 'cause [inaudible] come into little bit of unexpected money and also need to go and return the textbook and saturday will be devoted to starting nicely and maybe even to party with friend um [inaudible] another friend who [inaudible] sort of asking me about it i'm not sure it'll happen i'll be pretty pissed if he do though um [inaudible] i'm gonna try to sleep in little late tomorrow since stayed up late tonight though i'm going to try to set up an alarm so still have time to go shopping do everything wanted to do before it get dark outside and before the stores close so hopefully will wake up with plenty of time 
101,today woke up not feeling too well and pretty cold so showered and spent little time to calm down and eat um and spent the majority of the day shopping for christmas which was really helpful because got basically everything needed to get done and there are few things that need to go and do tomorrow um also got to see friend this evening which was nice 'cause we watched one of my well my favorite film and then tomorrow night might be going out with another friend just have to hear back from them and then made plans with friend for tuesday night so think it'll be nice to do some social things however i'm also little bit worried about my finals um definitely need to start some assignment tomorrow and then need to start studying [inaudible] focus next week [inaudible] and make sure that i'm prepared for all of my finals because really wanna do well so i'll just end up seeing how it go guess but [inaudible] think i'll make study guides for every single individual class um probably early next week have few more meetings with teachers as well which will help and then the night before each test can go over the study guides for quick review so hopefully that should help to prepare me well for the exams and i'm pretty confident about two of my courses the third i'm like fairly confident about and it really the fourth one that i'm super worried about but do have all the materials to study for it so it should end up being okay at least mean as long as pass and i've passed all the other exams so i'm not sure if don't pass the finals if i'll still fail the class or not 
102,woke up pretty late this morning um it was snowing for the first time which was really exciting so went outside [inaudible] and got to talk to lot of my family members went to see the snow and got lot of pictures for back home [inaudible] know where i'm from um finished up the rest of my christmas shopping um and even got stuff for people that didn't expect to find anything for so it was pretty exciting and had to get back to the [inaudible] so obviously [inaudible] prepared 'cause i'll be leaving guess week from monday i'm really looking forward to it [inaudible] that [inaudible] finals [from] this assignment that have due for class and it [inaudible] about some pretty tough stuff so keep trying to start it but haven't been able to yet 'cause really have to think about what i'm gonna write about 'cause it have lot to do with um death and things um but i'm gonna have to finish it tomorrow 'cause it due monday night and then have finals friday saturday and monday um i'm little bit worried about my friday finals lot worried about my saturday finals and not really stressed about my monday finals um but [inaudible] looking to [inaudible] skills and that should hopefully [inaudible] make me feel better not worse about my finals um and few others [inaudible] this week so uh still have little bit of time to relax and even though as do begin to study and prepare for finals kinda regret not starting earlier but at the same time feel like [inaudible] i've just been too stressed out if started earlier kinda get work better when it get down to crunch time so hopefully everything will be okay i'm not gonna focus on getting some i'm just gonna focus on passing the class so that should relieve some of the stress 
103,today woke up pretty late 'cause had pretty rough night sleeping last night um and really don't feel too well so pretty much stayed um in my room all day long and didn't eat food that was super healthy or anything which probably wasn't good but did leave for little bit of time to go to holiday party i'm excited that got to talk to few people that don't normally see and it was pretty nice [inaudible] made some soup really wish [inaudible] started all of my assignments but no motivation to do it um tomorrow think [inaudible] try and get up on time and get few things done so hopefully [inaudible] the assignments is due tomorrow at 900 so mean have fairly good idea what i'm gonna do but it still gonna be little bit difficult and might call my family for some help but i'm not positive yet so [inaudible] because even if don't do quite as well it should be all right since i've done really well on the other assignments for this class this semester and then need to start studying for my other finals that begin on friday 
104,today woke up [moments] again later than wanted to that probably 'cause stayed up really late last night which is why i'm going to bed earlier tonight and my roommate and is gonna set plan for tomorrow morning which will be really good um also even though woke up late still got few things done started some studying and finished my assignment that was due tonight little bit early was at meeting to sort of talk about how felt like my classes was going and how feel that things was going which was nice and then went to did some more shopping that didn't think about until the other day so that all set and i'm little bit stressed 'cause ordered package i'm not sure that it'll arrive before have to go home um but if it doesn't it not necessarily the end of the world i'll just be little bit annoyed um but am really looking forward to going home because it just gonna be week now and then i'll have the entire month off to relax and start making summer plan [inaudible] and tomorrow i'm definitely gonna be studying quite bit for my finals that is coming up i'm only really worried about one of them but will start studying for all of them um and also have [inaudible] little [inaudible] [date] tomorrow night so we'll see how that go and still need to make some appointment with this physical therapy and with um my teacher to go over few more things before my finals on friday so hopefully i'll get some stuff planned and everything set up tomorrow and also definitely really need to focus on studying so that can feel confident about [inaudible] exams 
105,today was pretty good um woke up pretty late 'cause i've been tired and i'm feeling super well today but still managed to get some studying done probably should have been little more focused than was but do still have tomorrow and thursday and half of friday to prepare for my first exam so it shouldn't be that bad um and then when wasn't studying ended up going out on date and it actually went super well and was really glad to have relaxing evening and probably spent little too much time out seeing as really needed to be studying but feel like it was kind of worth it because had really good time um and came back and kinda need to study but have little bit too much energy so hung out with friends for little bit and now i'm planning on studying and going to bed and hopefully i'll wake up little earlier tomorrow because do have some 900 am exam coming up so need to fix my sleep schedule for that um and also my food schedule need to actually start eating well which did tonight 'cause went out for my date um anyway have been eating lot of fruits and like yogurt and protein for breakfast so feel like that going pretty well um and just need to like keep it up now and probably order lunch from the dining hall tomorrow um which should be nice because their lunch is normally pretty good and can be like pretty healthy for you as well depending on what you get and i've still been eating lot of humus now might go work out tomorrow and also need to try and schedule some appointment with pt because tried to do that today but only got to on hold and it never answered the phone which was definitely little frustrating 'cause need to meet with my uh physical therapist before leave for break so that need to happen sooner rather than later since have all my finals friday saturday and monday and then probably won't have time to see their then um and mean basically now what have planned is studying i'm really glad that got my shopping done earlier so don't have to worry about that and can really just focus on preparing for my finals and getting into the right mindset to do that 
106,today slept in way too late and didn't get much work done just really didn't have the motivation and it weird 'cause feel worried about my finals but at the same time don't [inaudible] but that that not really good because know that definitely need to study for them so hopefully get my motivation back tomorrow and my roommate and are gonna actually try and wake up early tomorrow 'cause we've been saying that but we haven't actually done it and did order food so that will make sure to eat healthy food rather than like junk food that i've sort of been eating and just have to work tomorrow so that should help me get some of my motivation back um and then need to make some appointment with pd which are gonna be little bit difficult 'cause forgot to call them today and have barely any time before i'll have to leave on monday um but hopefully all my finals go well and then over break have few things need to get done but i've also already started making plans to hang out with friends and stuff so will spend some time relaxing some time doing schoolwork and then working for my family um i'm [already less] stressed because have started packing so that will be helpful 'cause then once get really busy with finals won't have to worry about it as much and [i was able to do the] shopping need to do hmm really need to work more but can do that next semester probably 'cause plans on being way more on top of things next semester think kinda got into little funk this semester but hopefully i'll get it worked out over break come back more motivated for the [inaudible] 
107,today was all right woke up on time and [made little] breakfast which was really nice and got food for my lunch hmm had shift at work which was tiring but wasn't too bad um other than that talked to lot of friends back home which made me little bit more excited about break um and made plans with another friends to go to the movies before leave to go back home which should be really nice um but overall still got very little motivation to prepare for my finals which is really bad because my first one is tomorrow and then have another one on saturday and then on monday um i'm not too worried about my finals tomorrow feel like it'll go okay and that i'll pass the class i'm really worried about my [friday] finals so i'm gonna try and wake up early tomorrow so that have plenty of time to prepare for it and to do little bit preparation for my finals tomorrow evening but um still like i'll be ultimately unprepared just hope still pass the class which the grading scale is different so feel like have pretty fair chance of passing [inaudible] with great grade but feel like that'll be okay because did really well in two of my class not so well in the other two which is definitely new for me but [it was] little more challenging [inaudible] definitely had stressful semester so i'll be happy if just pass also forgot to call pt again today so gotta try and do that tomorrow 'cause don't know if i'll have time to set an appointment before leave to go back home now 
108,today didn't go super well woke up on time and spent the morning studying but my roommate came back pretty early and sort of distracted me and interrupted my study other stuff um she doesn't really understand that need to focus which is frustrating and we both had an exam in the evening feel like it went okay and then she kinda did more stuff that was really frustrating while was trying to focus 'cause have an exam tomorrow morning so didn't get nearly as much studying done as wanted to and i'm really not feeling super confident about the exam tomorrow but i'm just gonna have to do my best and hopefully i'll pass i'm gonna go to bed because doesn't wanna get no sleep but i'm gonna try and wake up fairly early to look over stuff before have to go to the exam just 'cause i'm not feeling very confident about it at all it is gonna be long [inaudible] which will hopefully help me make enough points on it to pass which as long as do that should be fine in the class which is little bit reassuring um i'm just ready for it to be over with so i'll take this exam tomorrow and then just have one on monday and then get to go home i'm happy because this weekend i'm hanging out with friend that doesn't normally get to see um so that really nice and might confide in him little bit with the the struggles i've been going through this semester so hopefully that will be okay and hopefully i'll just pass 'cause that all wanna have happen really 
109,today woke up really early and had final to take so started little bit before it and then um went and took it and it honestly didn't go super well um don't know feel like was just not feeling too well and didn't do as well as could've but mean it too late to fix it and really just hope that still finished enough stuff to pass which mean don't know surely did so hopefully it'll be okay and other than that um all my friends have left except for one that i'm seeing tomorrow and then i've got one more final before head back home so mostly packed i'm little worried because feel like i'm packing um not enough stuff 'cause all my presents take up lot of room um but should be okay in the end and definitely have time on monday to pack before have to get to the airport so it should all work out 
110,today went all right woke up later than wanted to because wasn't feeling super well um but still managed to um get some of my work done did have time [inaudible] to set up meetings and had talked to some people on the phone so didn't get quite as much studying done as want to do then had friend plans with friend for the evening but it was still really nice and i'm little worried about my final tomorrow but also know that i've been working pretty hard in this class all semester so should still do well on the final um as long just look over general information little bit more know the passage identification is gonna be little more difficult than the rest of it overall three canticles but hopefully they'll choose pretty easy passage considering it over the entire work um so feel like some of them will at least be recognizable might not get all the points but still have pretty good feeling probably mean i've 20 to do so should do at least 15 um and my essay writing have always been pretty strong so i'm not fully expecting to get some but definitely feel really confident about passing and i'm ready to go home i'm mostly packed there is few more things that i'm just mainly throwing into my suitcase and i'm thinking about ordering lunch so that can eat before have to leave 'cause can run and get it after my final hopefully but i'm also gonna have to try and get pt tomorrow so have to call them as soon as get out of my final um and see if it have anything which it probably won't so mean maybe won't end up having to do that but kind of really need to go to the chiropractor when get home and need to make sure get everything packed that i'm gonna need 'cause don't wanna forget anything here but should have plenty of time mean hopefully the final won't take th-three hours i'm just glad that the semester is over 
111,today went really well woke up on time had my last final which actually did really well on um get grades back in few days so i'm pretty confident about two classes the other two i'm not so much but hopefully still passed um and then uh after finished my final had time to grab lunch which was really good and cleaned up my dorm room before moving to go to the airport to head home for the holidays um it was kind of frustrating 'cause the airport ride took longer than expected cost lot more than wanted it to but managed to my get to my flight on time and then my flight actually turned out to be delayed so spent majority of the days on an airplane and got home super late um lot later than expected but mean i'm just really glad to be here and to have an entire month at home which do need to get an stuff done but also can just spend time relaxing and getting to see family and i'm pretty excited for christmas need to start um wrapping my gifts but i'm pretty pumped about it 
112,today got to sleep in really late which was super nice um and spent the day at home with my little sister and spent lot of time cleaning um and worked on some course evals so have one less actual work thing to do over break which is super nice now only have to focus on applying for seminars and um applying for summer programs that might wanna be part of and yeah overall it was just super [pretty] relaxing day um and made plans with friend to hang out which was really cool um because wasn't sure if he would want to over break but he do so hopefully i'll get to do that sometime soon and i'll get to see my extended family and my cousins too and plans to spend whole day with them um and so yeah [honestly] i'm just really glad to be home tomorrow i'm planning on going into work um but it should be really nice and also have few shopping thing that wanna get done and people that want to see so i'm just so glad that it winter break and i'm still little anxious about getting my grades back but honestly i'm just trying to relax 
113,today was fine woke up little bit later than wanted to but it was still pretty early considering um then went to work first thing and stayed there for while which was mean nice um so it was just like my old routine getting back into it um then worked out with my brother which was little bit difficult because don't normally work out back at college but wanted to do it so was really glad and he was really helpful um which mean expected him to be so that was super nice and had really good time and i'm planning on making it daily habit so hopefully it'll be something that i'll continue doing once go back to college um i'm not super excited about tomorrow 'cause have to go and see some of my old friends who aren't all the nicest people in the world um so that should be interesting hope it'll be okay don't think anyone gonna do anything in particular it'll probably just be little bit annoying to be around him but shouldn't have to stay too long and there is one friends that am excited to see 'cause we're really close so at least i'll get to spend some time with him and then have plans with that same friends the next day as well um and need to make plans with some other friends and then have plans with my cousins the day before christmas and the day after christmas so i'm getting pretty busy but it really nice i'm little worried because get grades back tomorrow but it'll be nice to get it over with and stop worrying about that during break 
114,today went well slept in again later than wanted to but it wasn't too bad still got up and went to work and had good morning shift with some people that haven't seen in while so that was nice and then this evening saw some friends from back home which wasn't mean it was just about what expected it wasn't too horrible it also wasn't great but am just glad to see one of them that i'm actually really good friends with and super happy to see and tomorrow we'll hang out one-on-one which will be really nice and was also really relieved because well didn't get back all of my grades but did get back two grades that was the most worried about today and it looks like i've passed all of my classes i'm super glad about that and tomorrow i'll wake up kind of early have some chores to do and then i'm gonna shower and then i'll go to work again and hang out with some friends and tonight otherwise plan to spend time watching film with some family members which is really nice because it film that i've wanted to watch for really long time so it been nice break so far 
115,today was okay went into work again but got to spend some time in the morning relaxing before had to um and then spent the day at the restaurant mainly but it was really nice to be working um got to spend some time with with friend that didn't think i'd get to see today so that was pretty cool and hang out with her way better than expected to which was nice and then spent the evening with another friend and don't think i'll get to see him again before he leaves and we didn't get to spend as much time together as we wanted to but i'm still glad that got to see him overall um and should have plenty of time to see other friend from home and hopefully when my friend [back] from school that [i went to] my hometown as well so made plans with her but these next few day i'll probably just stay with my family um that should be nice 'cause we've got quite bit of stuff to prepare and to get ready for christmas but then after christmas we should have little bit more time to relax and just all be together 
116,today has been long day um woke up pretty late this morning and was really not feeling well um and continued to not feel good throughout the whole day basically went to work and [do have] few things that hope to clean up when get home need to clean lot i'm having really bad allergies think from being around all that animal stuff so spend more time dusting and sweeping and spent um my evening with my last my oldest sister who finally got home and it was great to see her and her boyfriend and then um we all ate little bit and has stayed up to wrap presents so that tomorrow evening we're not all as stressed about christmas um so stayed up pretty late doing that and just really started feeling horrible so i'm heading to bed and hopefully that will help so that won't feel as bad tomorrow but it kinda frustrating because my sheets are being washed now so now to put her on my bed before can actually go to bed and then it put all this stuff on the bed i'm supposed to be sleeping in so has to move it all off it little frustrating but it shouldn't take too long to do i'm just really not feeling well and we're supposed to go see lot of people tomorrow so really hope that start to feel better after wake up tomorrow morning i'm not even gonna set an alarm so that can probably sleep in little bit 
117,today was okay wasn't feeling super well so slept in quite bit um and then woke up and took shower and brushed my teeth to feel better and then ended up going back to sleep for while then spent the majority of the day relaxing with my family watched some shows played some games with them and also got some email about this [cancer] program applied to be part of next semester which was really happy about because it looks like i'll get to participate in the one that wanted to do um other than that was happy because was talking to friend from school and we're just trying little bit probably gonna make plans to hang out over break and talked to few of my other friend that haven't heard from in while and heard from another friend at school that it got the christmas present from me that it really liked it so was pretty happy about that because was little worried because um don't do christmas present with my friend so i'm super happy that she enjoyed what got them um and i'm on the lookout for package from them not quite sure when i'll get it though but pretty excited for christmas ended up staying up little bit too late just we had lot going on um which will make setting everything up slightly harder but did lot of it last night so that should definitely help out so hopefully won't have to stay up too late tonight because know that my little sisters will wanna get up early in the morning to see if santa come and everything 
118,today was fun woke up pretty early um 'cause it was christmas um and spent the holiday with family my parents was happy about the gifts got them which made me happy and my aunt [inaudible] was also happy about the gifts got for them so was really pleased because like getting gifts for people even though it said not to get them gifts figured that the stuff got it wouldn't like [and buy me] so in the end it looks like it did so i've been really happy [even] because got quite de few things asked for as well um especially book that i've been wanting to read um so that super cool because i'm getting to read that and tomorrow have pretty long day planned just waking up early to get home to play game with my cousins and my siblings which should last the majority of the day and then can see if earlier in the week might try to make plans with some friends or [whoever] we've gotten some of the allocations that are gonna be due coming up in january and need something [inaudible] so have few things to work on but also still have plenty of time to relax 
119,today was fine um we was supposed to meet woke up late um but we still went and met them anyway it was just later then intended and we spent the entire day playing dungeons and dragons campaign um which it was our first time ever playing except four of our cousins who had played before and it was pretty fun and it took literally the entire day um there was little bit of conflict just because some people didn't get along super well and other people was just causing controversy and not really focusing on the game so it took even longer um i'm sure we would all play again in the future and it will be fine but i'm also not super pumped about it because there too like overall there was too many people and it was too chaotic for me and there this [inaudible] really start feeling left out and when there that many people involved um so kinda had hard time and had [inaudible] but destressed by doing our laundry doing some art and watching our favorite films um and was little pissed off about our laundry because nail polish got on some of our clothes and haven't been able to get it out but can keep on trying so hopefully i'll figure out some solution so that don't have to get rid of that clothes and then tomorrow i'm supposed to get up very early to go to the dentist which i'm not thrilled about but it should be okay 
120,today was fine had to go to the dentist which went about just as well as expected it to which was not so great 'cause just have really bad teeth um i'm trying though to take care of them brush [inaudible] lot and [inaudible] flossing though [inaudible] it have to do with having small mouth according to my dentist um so i'm gonna have to go back tomorrow and get some more work done and prescribing me special toothpaste stuff like that which is not gonna be fun 'cause it basically gonna take up my entire day and the parts that i'm not actually at the dentist am gonna feel pretty miserable because it'll be rather sore probably swollen mouth and then i'm gonna have to make plans with friend who actually saw tonight but what them plans for sometime later in the week [inaudible] is one of them on friday but honestly don't wanna hang out with any of them but guess might as well just do it and get it over with and hopefully can find some time to myself [inaudible] because [inaudible] big family so it hard to get any alone time ever especially since my sister birthday coming up and trying to see all my cousins before it leave town again 
121,today had to wake up to go to dentist and woke up feeling pretty exhausted um but still needed to go to dentist was little bit late but not anything too bad hmm did some work done but it was actually lot less than it first said um so wasn't there for too long but my mouth did swell up whole bunch 'cause just have really sensitive mouth and it super small um so have to go back tomorrow just to get the last few things done hopefully it won't be too bad because after that have to meet with my friends so i'm [preparing to go] to bed and the dentist [inaudible] want to meet with my friends really trying to just [inaudible] of the way [but it] is little bit annoying because [inaudible] my end-of-term group begins today and there still one class that have not put my grade in yet but it is class am pretty confident about so i'm not too worried about it it just would be nice to know my finalized grade so hopefully that will get posted sometime soon 
122,today was okay had to go to the dentist and was there for the majority of my day and my mouth really hurt afterwards um 'cause they did some work but then they messed up so they had to redo some of they so was there for longer than expected basically they was just mess and had took lot of medicine to try and make my mouth feel better but basically didn't feel good for the rest of the day and still don't feel well so i'm trying to go to bed little bit earlier um did also meet up with my friends which went just about as expected to which wasn't great because generally they just try and talk [in one of each other] and pretty much sat there in silence um so hopefully won't have to see them again before go back i'll just hang out with some of my other friends like my friends from school who actually like and hopefully that will go better and then went back to work and hoped to close down um um still really didn't feel well and got home pretty late had dinner pretty late and tomorrow is my little sister birthday so i'm having to prepare for that which is generally just lot of stress um 'cause they was not going to [redacted] we have to drop all them presents and do all that and also have to be ready to go to work in the morning again so i'm hoping that i'll wake up and my mouth won't hurt as much anymore 
123,today did not go super well the morning started off fine and i've [inaudible] and was happy to be at work doing something that i'm used to and something that is fun um so it it started out just perfectly fine and was pretty happy and was on top of it didn't really eat much though which was probably part of the reason wasn't started not feeling well later in the day and on top of that my mouth was still sore it didn't feel any better since yesterday and that [inaudible] worse so felt really disconnected from all of my family members [inaudible] that so it was nice to [inaudible] with people but was really interested in getting some sleep which is really difficult for me and really makes me feel bad um so ended my day pretty upset which is why [inaudible] just got home planning to go straight to bed instead of staying up um and maybe just taking some time with myself tomorrow because am still pretty upset about it but also don't really feel like discussing it but just whenever try to it don't understand so it not really worth it to keep bringing it up just to be misunderstood and feel like no one cares even don't know more so i'll just try to [inaudible] myself do art or some writing to relax 
124,today was fine slept in pretty late woke up not feeling super well because had migraine but also not too bad hmm just took some medicine and it went away and then spent the rest of the day with family which was okay um it turned out better than expected it would be after uh yesterday and the day before um other than that had pretty nice [new year's] party um did talk to quite few of my friends um which was fun and i'm gonna make plans to hang out with some of them pretty soon which should be nice and i'm happy 'cause still have basically month till go back to school um so should have plenty of time to relax and fill out of some of my um study abroad applications and things like that to prepare for next semester um somewhere around spring break so everything going pretty well 
125,today slept in really late and then spent part of the day going into town with my sisters and getting some shopping done um which was fun because didn't spend too much and even got some cute stuff and also got to treat my sisters to little snack on the way back home and then and spent the rest of the evening pretty much relaxing [inaudible] my sis my sisters and her boyfriend are heading back home tomorrow um it was really nice for me to get my mood back and [my sleep] which i've been trying to work on [inaudible] vacation and my art that wanted to do um so it was all pretty nice on the downside there lot of tension between my mom and dad right now which makes everything really rough uh tomorrow have to get up very early to [do my studying] and [inaudible] but i'm trying to [inaudible] super great [inaudible] makes me [inaudible] and gives me headache so that not gonna be very much fun and hopefully i'll be able to get up on time since didn't really go to bed as early as should have 
126,today was fine and did begin pretty early um but today it was because had to go to the dentist again it did lot of work and [inaudible] mouth it even scratched my face at one point but um in the end it wasn't too too bad it was okay and on the plus side hopefully won't have to go back for bit although it did tell me that have to get my wisdom teeth out which is also not gonna be very much fun and also have to make doctor appointment because have to do everything that can um while i'm home since don't have dental and stuff back at campus although do have medical but still i'm gonna try and get as much done as possible um it gonna be fun um kind of on the plus side my sister and her boyfriend left today so get my room back i'm also sad that my sister leaving but also the combination of her and her boyfriend is pretty obnoxious and have been wishing that next christmas she would just come back by herself but really doubt that it gonna happen uh because it looks like they're gonna give me read and all so we'll just have to see um but mean can put up with him because he make her happy other than that i'm little getting slightly worried just because it so close to school starting back up and hadn't realized um that have so few days left here at home um and still have quite few things to do but it shouldn't be too bad mean have time to get her done really just have to finish my study abroad applications my freshman summer applications need to respond to few other things and um then the rest of it is really just self improvement that want to [inaudible] going to the gym more which my brother is helping me with and eating healthier which i'm trying to do on my own and practicing violin working on my art things like that um so will have plenty of time in this last few days at home to work on some of that stuff 
127,today was fine woke up little bit too late but um so was supposed to go to work this morning but it still wasn't bad um but did get to work and stayed there for basically the whole day spent some of the evening hanging out with friend that haven't seen since got home and spent the rest of the evening at home with my family um watching film which is why probably stayed up later than should have 'cause have to get up and go back to work tomorrow morning um but mean i'm sure that i'll get up [inaudible] and it will be fine my other thing is um my tooth have been hurting so had to go to the dentist the other day and also have to [go to] chiropractor 'cause i'm very sore but [hopefully] get to do that as well tomorrow um my sister is leaving on saturday so i'm probably pretty busy until then but do have sundays and mondays off so that'll help little bit 
128,today was fine basically once again all did was wake up and go to work um which however i'm pleased [inaudible] which is little bit stressful but could [inaudible] and everything okay but wasn't feeling super well 'cause still have to go to the chiropractor and it been like months now um so hopefully might go tomorrow mean hopefully at least if not tomorrow it will be sometime this week because desperately need to go i'm starting to get headaches and double vision since haven't been so long um so know that once am able to go and do that i'll start feeling lot better and um other than that have few errands need to run that haven't been able to do since i've been at work every day basically um and don't know when i'll get that done if wake up on time tomorrow can go in even earlier for work and maybe get some shopping done so i'm gonna try and do that but i've been really tired i'm staying up too late um my my [little] sister wanted to spend time um but hopefully i'll be able to take it up in the morning on time and go in 
129,today it was all right spent the day at work um and woke up this morning really not feeling well so drank lot of tea and took some medicine to try and make myself feel better um but one of our workers um ended up not being able to come in so we had to call on her [inaudible] and the [police] isn't exactly hopeful so that was pretty stressful because we had to do more work to make up for it and the other people that was on the shift weren't exactly weren't oriented either and so [redacted] he really [toughed] the shift because we did get quite busy um but we was able to handle it was little bit annoyed then went to the chiropractor today so i'll probably be sore um tomorrow but after that should feel lot better 'cause i'm always bit sore right after some adjustment before the soreness goes away um and hopefully drinking this herbal tea stuff that our cousin recommended will stop our sore throat um 'cause really don't want to have to goes to the doctor while i'm here and tomorrow our older our other older sister is going back to school um so will be the only one left now since get to stay so late which is nice but also means i'll have more stuff to do on top of the schoolwork that already need to be doing and haven't really started but now [inaudible] sundays and mondays should be freed up little bit more so that can hopefully get stuff done then 
130,today was fine it was basically the same as every other day um got up and went to work which did wake up little bit earlier today um again work was super duper busy so that was what spent my whole day doing um but it was good mean we handled it was also excited because we got to make some really good cheese um that love and that also super fun to make and got to do it so was excited about that um had quite few customers and after work got to um see my grandmother which was also really nice since haven't seen her in while um only the only real downside of the day was that my other older sister left um because she had to go back to school already and i'm kinda sad 'cause we didn't get to spend too much time with her um since her break was lot shorter than mine but um i'm so glad that did get to see her and hopefully i'll get to see her again in april if not in april then most likely at least get to see her for little bit over the summertime so we'll just see what happens 
131,today had lazy day at home um so got to sleep in really late and spent most of the day just relaxing with my family which is really lovely we're doing harry potter marathon um so we can [inaudible] that that was fun and um should've worked on some things but didn't really get anything done and was planning on working on stuff tomorrow but it turns out i'll actually have to be in town all day with my mom might try and take my laptop though so can still do few things in the car 'cause we'll be going out of town to do some shopping for the restaurant um but hopefully that should be fun mean i'm not really sure but should be okay i'm just kind of upset 'cause that mean have to get up pretty early and hadn't planned on it especially since i'm going to bed so late since didn't find find out until just minute ago but it should still be fine so we'll just see how it goes 
132,today woke up early which was on time because had plans with my mom this morning um but we didn't end up getting to them until way later than expected so spent the majority of the day with my grandmother and one of my cousins um but it turned out to be lot better than expected um really 'cause don't get to talk to my cousins recently she much younger than am and whenever we get together she don't talk to me 'cause i'm bit older and she hangs out with the kids um so it was really interesting today 'cause went to speak to them lot and my uncle stopped by them dad so went to see them as well and he my godfather so it was really nice and he wanted to make plans to meet up before go back to school um 'cause he has some stuff he wants to discuss with me and book that he got me for christmas was waiting uh for it to come into the bookstore so i'm gonna make plans with them soon hopefully um other than that spent the rest of the day with my mom we had to go to town to get some shopping done um which turned out fine we was kind of quite while but it wasn't too bad traffic was just little bit heavy um but was pretty happy because made plans with well somewhat planned with someone for when get back to school and made plans with friend for tomorrow morning to get breakfast um who also from out of state um so it would be nice to hangs out with them again 'cause haven't seen them in like few weeks um and then after that i'll just spend the day at work and i'm planning on taking my sketchbook and some other stuff and book to read um so that hopefully the time will speed up when don't has any customers can keep busy and actually feel productive instead of just sitting down like has been doing for the last few day 
133,today was okay um woke up later than wanted to and was pretty exhausted had plans with friend to go to breakfast so definitely had to get up um but they ended up canceling the last minute but they was already too late 'cause had already gone into town um so in struggling to get with them just went into work to try and come home early um and then got lot of stuff done there still felt like wasn't really getting enough stuff uh prepared to go back to school feel like i'm not ready to start again large part of they is going back and seeing some of my friend 'cause they're not exactly the best um but there is few people i'm excited to see and i'm trying to give myself more scet set plans and schedule next semester so that make sure to do things like work out and um work for my job little bit more than had last semester um and go to the dining hall more and things like that and stay on top of my homework um so hopefully it'll be okay i'm glad that still have uh quite bit of break left because definitely need the time off um to try and get my head on straight and i'm planning on talking to my counselor again once start going back to school 
134,today was all right um woke up too late to go in early with my mom because wasn't feeling well and then there was lot to be done [inaudible] um so did all of that worked all day and got into fight with my with my sister um over financial stuff and other things and almost ended up changing my ticket back to early but knew my mom and my other little sister would be really upset if did that so didn't um [inaudible] just stayed at the restaurant all day long and worked and didn't even have time to work on stuff for school but um should be able to stay home at least friday or saturday mainly and then also have sunday and monday to work on it um because tomorrow i'm gonna get up in time to go into town with my mom and then have plans with friend later on that haven't seen since got home so hopefully that will be fun 
135,today woke up on time um it took me longer than wanted it to to get ready um but was still on time so that was good went to town early so got to get some shopping done that really wanted to do which was really nice um and then at work the morning shift turned out pretty busy but it was okay 'cause we basically had enough help and then got to leave work early to go hang out with um some high school friends one of them hadn't seen and was leaving [redacted] tomorrow um and had some okay time with them it wasn't quite everything wanted it to be but it was still pretty good was glad got to see them before it left before left and i'm really considering um making plans with one of my other friends that had seen once since got back home um to try and see them again before have to go back to school but i'm trying to decide because sometimes hanging out with them can be more frustrating than it is fun um but i'm also don't have too much time left so have to make plans with people pretty soon before head back to school 
136,today woke up little bit later but still got to work as usual um and work was super busy um it got busier than expected so had to get some extra help um and that was basically had been there all day and the rush we got was at the nighttime so was basically on my feet for good three hours without being able to take break so i'm definitely sore i'm having some back issues but not anything too super bad so hopefully by tomorrow i'll feel little bit better because we have catering job that have to prepare for um also [inaudible] just one of the other employees [inaudible] early now [inaudible] calling to [let me know] am such hard worker um which made me feel good and [so] definitely talk to them more [inaudible] usual and it kind of nice to talk to some regular customers um my uncle stopped by [just tried] to see them for bit um so overall it was productive day even got some of the schoolwork done had been meaning to work on should book another [inaudible] tomorrow and have i'm staying home for the [friday] and sunday so it should be nice 
137,work was super busy again today um so ended up being super tired 'cause we stayed later than we had been um and we just had more customers and more rushes than normal um which wouldn't have been bad except for the fact that really needed to get some of my writing done for some applications so i'll have to try and work on that tomorrow and the next day [inaudible] since didn't have time to do it at work um and didn't really get to take break so i'm currently sore and not feeling well and was super sleepy basically day long um and when got home should've just gone to bed but my little sister wanted to stay up so ended up staying up way too late watching show um which really just made me feel worse so i'm gonna sleep in tomorrow and hopefully that will make me feel better 
138,today was having lazy day at home intended to get some of my stuff done but didn't the only thing did accomplish was laundry um which did still make me feel pretty good other than that didn't do anything all day long really um [inaudible] 'cause tomorrow i'm gonna have to go to dallas i'm just gonna [inaudible] i'll try and to write my um some more applications 'cause the-they're due in just about two day believe um so really really have to get them done really just have not been in the right mindset to do any work was supposed to go [inaudible] today which hoped woulda helped but they cancelled on me last minute um which kinda just made me feel worse um hopefully tomorrow will be better and guess even if do end up going to dallas on the way can still work on my some of my applications um and hopefully get some [inaudible] um there are lot want to apply to but definitely need to cut they down anyway and only apply to couple and then have few other school thing need to do 'cause go back in week which i'm excited about and stressed about 
139,today was basically just another lazy day at home um slept in 'cause didn't feel too great so took some medicine for migraine and [inaudible] rest of my day is just [inaudible] relaxing um accepted my place in the kangaroo dance thing um which should be lot of fun for when go back to school but it'll also be really big time commitment and also looked into doing sorority type thing as well and some of the classes i'm gonna be taking but couldn't really find the motivation to write my freshman summer applications which is due tomorrow by noon um have worked on few though so should just submit those which won't be as many as wanted to submit but even if don't get into one can just take another classes shouldn't be some issue um and tomorrow we will probably have work unless the weather is too bad so guess we'll see 'cause if we don't have work then will definitely have more time to do some of my seminars in the morning as long as actually wake up which is debatable as to whether or not will 
140,just stayed at home all day today um instead of going into work because slept in late because my [inaudible] kept me up for good portion of the evening um and then kept waking up in the middle of the night because i'm not feeling too well so did just end up staying home and it was pretty nice to have day off but my [sooners] was due at 1200 and woke up because didn't do them because forgot that the time zone over there is an hour ahead of here um so should've turned them in an hour before had planned to um which was completely my fault so had an of them written and ready but it should be fine can just take normal class or if there is spots left for an [sooners] you can email professors sometimes to get in so might be able to try that as well and my [inaudible] advisor emailed me today so i'll have to try and get back to them tomorrow and also need to start um financial aid stuff and um summer and spring break programs [start] tomorrow um which hopefully i'll be able to do even though i'll be going into work in the morning and also hope that can get little bit of shopping done but don't know that my mom necessarily wants me to so i'll just have to see because i'll ha am going back to school in just few day feel like am ready for it but not really ready for it 
141,today slept in little bit later than intended so went in-into town later as well which was due to me just not feeling super well um and then spent the day at work which weren't super busy so when weren't working did few things for school and also played some games um and then after work had to go to the dentist which was fine um it was actually quick this time and this is the last time i'll have to go before i'm back campus in just few day um my roommate was [inaudible] along today which is cool because it kind of made me more excited to go back um and was super happy because got some email from the departments about how well did in class um basically asking if was further interested in studying that subject so i'm super pumped about that because it is something i'm interested in so i'll probably meet with them when get back to campus as well 
142,today woke up on time which was pretty early this morning went and got to do some shopping um got to choose my own [inaudible] which was really cool because got to get lot of stuff that wanted and needed um to go back um to school this semester i'm also pretty excited 'cause think finally decided um which study abroad programs i'm going to apply to and know there so much stuff need to get done and have some solid plans for going back um just can't believe that only have few days left in my hometown [inaudible] sort of [inaudible] wanna come back here for spring break but also worry that if come back here too much that i'm just gonna wanna stay so think i'm gonna try and [inaudible] spring break [inaudible] somewhere else and then kinda just come back here for summer and i'll have whole another month or so off depending on whether or not can [inaudible] study abroad programs i'm definitely gonna miss my family lot and i'm hoping that the stress of this semester doesn't get as bad as it did the last semester because should be little bit more prepared and [inaudible] this whole idea of how to handle it but things [inaudible] frustrating like it did the last semester um so hopefully [they] will get better 
143,today was another normal day um went to work but before that went to um to have facial done as birthday present um which was really nice it was super relaxing um and was glad that started monday out on positive note like that um after that did come in to work and we was fairly busy but the employees mostly handled it so was able to get some schoolwork done which was awesome because have quite few things that have due dates that are coming up um and tomorrow i'm hoping to get more time to finish them because know that when get back to campus it'll be really busy but i'm not sure if it'll happen because have to do lot of shopping tomorrow um also in preparation of going back to school so i'm going to have to see mean we do have quite few employees coming in so might be able to do that other than that um my family all came by to see me before um [heading] out of state and [inaudible] me like happy birthday wishes so got some gifts and got to see everyone which was pretty nice little bit stressful 'cause it came at time when we was busy at work um but it turned out all right and some of the books got was really awesome and i'm super excited about being able to read them and i'm pretty ready for school to start again now 'cause feel like i've mostly got my classes and my schedule figured out for when get back to campus so it should be okay 
144,today was my last day at home um tomorrow i'm heading back to school it was definitely pretty stressful day lot of stuff happened um that wasn't exactly great and [inaudible] to be back at school i'm definitely stressed because didn't really get the chance to prepare and to do everything wanted to do um before heading back so i'm gonna have lot more work tomorrow and definitely lot more luggage than expected which is little bit frustrating um but i'm probably just gonna have to get some friends to help get it back to the dorm which hopefully it will be available and it gonna definitely take while to unpack stayed up later than intended to packing in the first place um but don't know as far as classes and everything feel like it should be all right didn't really get the summer wanted but that okay 
145,today got back to school spent basically the entire day traveling which was not fun was really stressed almost missed my flight um luckily they still let me on which was super nice um and other than that had to say goodbye to my family which was really difficult um i'm definitely going to miss them all uh i'm not going to get to see them for while hopefully i'll get to see them in march for spring break and my sister in april if we're [ever at] them school we'll just have to see um quite few things are starting this week have my first class tomorrow at 830 in the morning which are definitely gonna be little difficult 'cause really stayed up too late tonight packing and getting getting some other stuff done um and there are stuff programs that need to apply to so i'm [definitely] gonna have to work on that tomorrow 'cause the deadline coming up since should've finished that at home didn't have time to was gonna work on some stuff on the plane but then some thoughts have happened wasn't able to um basically they was really stressful day and just really hope that my class go well i'm meeting my academic adviser later in the week so hopefully they can help me out um with everything and hope that can also get [inaudible] into more set routine going to bed on time getting up on time doing my homework quickly starting yoga and seeing some friends and joining [clubs] that i'm interested in because feel like doing that things and being more social will make me have much better semester overall 
146,today had my first real day of classes so had to get up little bit early but that really wasn't too bad um managed to do it and made it to classes on time and that classes should go about how expected it to um which is not gonna be super well unless put in quite bit of work which i'm definitely gonna try to do i'm gonna try and time-manage my semester found really great spot to study um that think i'm gonna start taking advantage of because think it will definitely help me focus and will help me to get out of the room more um also signed up for sorority-type event um that had to pretty much force myself to do 'cause it will make me socialize lot more but i'm really looking forward to it and i'm still debating doing the other sororities as well um because do wanna get lot more involved um i'm pretty excited because i'm shopping two classes although think i'm pretty set on which one i'm planning on taking although will figure it out with my academic advisor on wednesday um and also on wednesday have pta meeting which will be nice although i'm probably not prepared but am planning on starting to work it out and get set schedule down which should help with that and also have my first um dance practice which is super exciting 'cause believe that will give me nice community of people to work with um since we'll all be dancing together and being in show together so hopefully everything gonna look up 
147,today got to couple of other classes went shopping and it looks like it'll be um fun but also lot of hard work and had to get quite few textbooks for it uh so had to enter lottery for it so hopefully will in fact get in um because i've already gotten the books and i'm really looking forward to taking it so if don't i'm gonna have to try and find different classes to be in um and am going to meet with an academic advisor tomorrow so that should help little bit um basically my schedule is super busy because have an applications due in two days tomorrow i've got four different appointments and an event to go to all evening so i'll definitely have to try and finish my homework for thursday sooner um and then need to do my homework for friday because on thursday will be super busy once again and thursday is when my applications am due um so i'm gonna have to get all of that done [over] short time period um where don't have lot of time to myself so may have to try and find an alternative study space to work on essays and things but i'm looking forward to doing these event because feel like it'll make me more social and i'll just have to plan my time accordingly so it'll be okay 
148,today was really fun got to um not have any classes so instead just had bunch of meetings with um professors um to talk about my future in both classics in neuroscience which was interesting um because i'm still not really sure what wanna do but think that it at least helped little bit um and then also [inaudible] and we discussed um plans for the summer which didn't really have um the applications done for and they're due tomorrow so that not exactly great but i'm planning on getting up early tomorrow morning and just focusing and really working on them because have events um tomorrow evening and then i'll be fairly busy on friday as well um have homework that need to get completed for friday so i'm gonna have to try and do all of that thursday morning um but hopefully it won't be too bad and then [inaudible] going into this weekend it looks like i'll be pretty busy with um some extracurricular activities tonight had my first dance group appointment um and it was lot of fun but also still [inaudible] is pretty big time commitment which is gonna make my classes little bit more difficult but think if just focus on finding good support systems both with friends and with professors then the next semester will turn out okay um was disappointed because didn't get into my classes really wanted to get into but you know it might be okay because i'm taking another really fun classes with good friends um so hopefully that will be awesome 
149,today was pretty busy um had friend in class and it was fun um especially 'cause have the class with my friend so we all got to be there together um ran into someone haven't seen in while that i've [inaudible] but didn't actually talk to him so maybe i'll try and get that next time because didn't get my confidence up little bit today um because managed to make myself go to an event um and plan on continuing to do that have another event tomorrow night and feel like it definitely helping me become little bit more social and outgoing it'll help me make an new friend and it just helping my overall happiness overall to be doing things instead of staying in the room the whole time especially 'cause i'm still able to stay on top of my schoolwork while doing it finished an applications tonight and i've got two more that will get start go through other opportunities that i'm looking forward to so it should be really good i'm gonna meet with my counselor next week and think that she will definitely be proud of me for the work that i've been doing um so hopefully this semester is already going better than last semester would just have to take that class [inaudible] 'cause am gonna struggle in two of him 
150,today was fine only had one class and met someone really nice in it so was pretty happy about that because used to work with him which was fine um other than that had to go to work today but it was okay plus got to talk to my sister on the phone for like two hours and hadn't talked to her for like weeks um so that was really nice as well and then [inaudible] spent some time [relaxing] in my room i'm super happy 'cause got um new computer in the mail that had been looking forward to and i'm still trying to set it up so hopefully i'll have little more luck tomorrow or something but it seems super nice so it should be fine i'm probably gonna call him and see how to set up [inaudible] with some actual professionals um and then this evening we had some friends over for little pizza party which was lot of fun 'cause they're both super nice and had another sorority event to go to but that was also all right because had really good time um at it and ran into someone that knew um which was super cool because didn't realize that she was also doing the sorority stuff um so hopefully that will help have another big sorority event tomorrow that will basically last the majority of my morning so i'm gonna take some homework to work on so hopefully can still get stuff done while also figuring out if want to join that sorority and the weekend think it'll be super busy and have quite bit of work to do as well so yeah i'm just trying to balance everything out 
151,today was fun um recently had social event on morning [inaudible] so got up pretty early to get ready for that um and still had time to breakfast and everything get prepared and went met lot of really cool people that was really glad got the chance to talk to and got to so see some other people that um know from other event which was awesome 'cause didn't know that they was also involved um so that took the majority of my morning um also got very last-minute email for one of my classes about some of my work requirements for monday which was definitely stressful 'cause already have busy weekend and have to add some extra work on top of that um so had to go running around looking for book at the very last minute um and luckily they had one left in stock so managed to get that for my classes hmm and then other than that um spent the day trying to set up my new computer and get they fully working which am super pumped about so hopefully it'll be more operational tomorrow and i'm gonna get up bit early again because have gotta get bunch of homework done and then have my social event in the evening to go to um that will take uh quite bit of time but should still have time to do little bit more homework after this so gotta get ready for the week 
152,today was not exactly great um had fun going to the event that had today but i'm already struggling with my schoolwork and it barely the first week of classes um so went ahead and signed up for tutor and have meeting with my therapist on tuesday so think i'm just gonna have to be really straightforward don't know if i'm depressed or just have really bad anxiety about my work but it not going well and feel like i'm falling behind in my last semester my grades weren't great and mean to me i'm just at the point of considering taking year off which definitely don't want to do but feel like might have to do because don't really know what other options have um and even thinking about it just is upsetting me 'cause feel like i'm behind everyone else here um [inaudible] lot of people feel like that but i'm feeling for me it true in the stem department know in humanities i'm generally okay but think my prior stem education was lacking um but think talking to my therapist will help and she'll probably provide me with other resources so it hard for me to really talk to people because i'm embarrassed about what don't know but feel like just have to bite the bullet if want the semester to go any better than last semester and do 'cause wanna be less stressed yeah and on top of everything so need to get to point where can do that and function 
153,today was okay um woke up on time and managed to get little bit of my homework done that didn't [done] last night then had all my classes um but had to go to one for the first time that was actually super interesting and i'm really glad i'm taking it i'm little frustrated 'cause think it will change for another one of my classes that make my schedule little bit more messed up than it was previously um we should be [inaudible] to get worked out and then had pretty busy evening as well um and finished my essay that was due by midnight and did um go to two different meetings and had to miss rehearsal to go to the second meetings um it wasn't the best but [inaudible] anything that can't make up uh so it should be okay and i'm really excited because have my [inaudible] sorority stuff and now just have to wait for bit which will be wednesday morning really hope we can get one 'cause i'm super pumped about it and i've met so many nice people um but i'm just really looking forward to doing it uh tomorrow is gonna be definitely busy should have done little bit more reading but [inaudible] already few time so hopefully [inaudible] enough um and on top of that i'm meetings with my counselor tomorrow and already have quite few things that wanna talk to her about uh so hopefully that meetings will be productive 
154,today was pretty good um had uh quite few classes but they was pretty interesting was little sleepy 'cause ended up not being able to fall asleep for while last night even after tried to go to bed um they okay 'cause still managed to stay awake during my classes and then after classes was over went to have [inaudible] with my counselor um which was really nice um because haven't seen her since i've been back so talking to her was great and then um really was able to focus and got my homework done and felt okay about they not great but have applied for tutor and plan to go to office hours once they start up um so that should definitely help and um since finished my homework pretty early also got to finish an application that wanted to do and still had time to watch show um so they was nice way to end the evening do have to get up super early tomorrow but they for an exciting reason 'cause they bid day um they the reason go to bed so i'll [inaudible] go join one which am super pumped about can't wait to see lot of people know so they exciting 
155,today was exciting because i've had to get up early um to go out and find out which sorority was gonna be part of um so joined and got the [approved] list with um all the other girls that joined in the [inaudible] which is super cool especially because already knew few of the other members and [inaudible] some of the other girls who got into to the same sorority um so that was exciting because i'll have friend in that and i'm really looking forward to doing all the events that is fun and hopefully really good way for me to get more involved um [totally fun way] to have some other friend um going down [inaudible] with one of my other extra good friend from [inaudible] but i'm gonna try and get it worked out so hopefully it will be okay um only had one class today which was nice because had to get up super early um so was really tired so had originally planned [to work] but being extremely tired paired with not feeling well resulted in me taking nap instead so i'll just go and do the work on saturday which won't be nearly as fun but i've got to do it because i'm trying to be captain um and i'm little bit stressed because have test keep forgetting about tomorrow night that i'm not prepared for and stayed up way too late just had um something extracurricular tonight that took up all the time and i'm [inaudible] homework and had stress with my blocking group stuff that resulted in me also being distracted from my homework to try and deal with that for while so hopefully tomorrow will be better even though it pretty busy day 
156,today went really well um had my one of my classes for the second time today um think it was nice because we had we have group assignment for the weekend and um i'm fairly excited about [inaudible] [about] to work with so also sort of made another friend in the classes um this other guy that was in one of my classes last semester um it just really cool to have have person know um other than that only had one other classes it was super fun and had to meet professor which was little late too um because [messed up] my [inaudible] [falling out] um so ended up meeting with her pretty late but it was okay 'cause ran into another girl that knew um and then when was done still had time to study for my exam tonight which went ok probably could have studied for little bit more but don't think did too badly um and then even got to get dinner with friend um before the exam someone i'm blocking with so it was really good to hang out with him other than that tomorrow shouldn't be too busy but do have lab which is quite long and i'm debating whether or not to try and um take some time to go to work tomorrow because do have little gap of time in the middle of the day but could also use it to do some homework um because might be going out tomorrow night i'm not really sure yet um and on saturday have plans with another guy but also have to do my group project saturday and go to work on saturday so we'll see how it all work out 
157,today was pretty good only had two classes but one of them was lab so it took quite bit of time um and made plans to hang out with someone tomorrow which was nice but at the same time also have to do group project which i'm not as excited about um but i'll get it all done also have to go to work tomorrow but it should be ok because have it all planned out so that can do everything wanna do so guess i'll get up on time in the morning probably gonna have to get coffee or something 'cause i'm going to bed so late but it was worth it 'cause tonight went out to party and had really good time with the the girls from [redacted] think made really good friend or two um and i'm really looking forward to future events with all of them hanging out partying doing stuff so i'm just really grateful that get to be part of such wonderful community and mean wasn't sure that i'd get in and did so i'm really excited about it 
158,today was pretty good had to wake up pretty early to group project and that was just on time for that um which was nice and i'm glad about the group that i'm working with because everyone sweet and everyone on top of it so we can get work done um it also more than expected so was gonna have [inaudible] and then went to my job for few hours which was nice 'cause [inaudible] extra so [inaudible] extra next week um and then other than that had date this evening which was all right [inaudible] think have feelings for him like that and he obviously have feelings for me um so i'm not exactly sure how i'm gonna handle it but as for the evening hanging out with few more of my friends [inaudible] which made me feel lot better about it um [inaudible] if [inaudible] getting home [inaudible] you know um and join my friends but should be able to get some time tomorrow and try and get up um fairly early um 'cause [inaudible] five and like three assignments to monday and two assignments to tuesday or three assignments to tuesday so have quite bit to do uh but it shouldn't be too bad as long as get up and actually focus and get it done um so hopefully will stick to that 
159,today was all right um was little bit um frustrated about this guy i've been talking to but hopefully i'll be able to handle it 'cause um over the next few days 'cause don't really wanna spend too much time worrying about it um i've got lot of homework to do today and got [errands] to be done and still need to catch up on some readings um may have some time today or tomorrow but also have to be home to do group project tomorrow because my group couldn't meet up today um but was also glad because got to spend some time with friends we actually went out to dinner which was nice um it really was kind of worth it and this week is looking like it'll be pretty busy i've got quiz tomorrow not tomorrow tuesday and class i'm gonna have to get ready for so hopefully i'll get everything done in timely fashion so have time to study and go to bed at reasonable hour instead of super late like have been doing i'm going to dance practice tomorrow night which i'm not necessarily looking forward to maybe because i'm pretty tired and sore and haven't had time to practice i'm pretty sure it'll still be okay [inaudible] because we only have four more practice until my show but i'll just have to try and find some free time to work on the dance on my own 
160,today was all right i'm not feeling too well and i'm full of worry and getting sick so i'm getting sore throat which isn't gonna be good because have my dance performance coming up and quite few events um to my other extracurriculars and i'm also super busy with schoolwork have possibly two courses tomorrow and lot of reading that i'm behind on um but we-wednesday at least is my slow day so hopefully can just go to class and work and take some time to relax since i'm not feeling super well but will also have to go to work um i'm really hoping that don't have strep or the flu 'cause that what it feeling like but hopefully um will just take some emergency and start feeling better and trying to sleep lot we'll see 
161,today went pretty well um was pretty prepared for class in section which had been worried about but it turned out all right it was really nice to see my crew members in class and just [inaudible] having [inaudible] always makes it easier um [inaudible] do an assignment that i'm super excited about that i'm gonna have to finish tomorrow 'cause was planning on starting today but never did which is definitely not gonna be fun 'cause it an assignment that [inaudible] come easily to me hopefully it won't take too long 'cause only have one class tomorrow but really need to go to work and need to practice for dance and go to actual dance practice um and then on tuesday have few things to do on friday have an things to do have quite few things leading into this weekend i'm prepared for having uh stress because [inaudible] dance performance it also coming up and definitely haven't practiced enough so really need to be on [inaudible] and have three practice left um and [inaudible] all right had to [clear] the [inaudible] super prepared for but think [this] will turn out okayish um and [inaudible] my section today actually am waiting for [inaudible] so [inaudible] my therapist is going to be pleased and [inaudible] generally don't speak um and got lot of time to talk to my mom and it felt like [inaudible] things sometimes which was really nice and relaxing and also managed to do my laundry and clean up little bit which always makes me feel better 
162,today was all right woke up earlier than needed to and was exhausted since went to bed so late so got to go back to sleep which was really nice and class went fairly well did get grade back that wasn't too great but should be able to make it up no problem which will be really nice um other than that was really busy went to work um which was good [so that's] out of the way so don't have to worry about it on saturday and have dance practice tonight which took up quite bit of time which was difficult 'cause had an assignment up that i'd been working on that i'm [inaudible] due tomorrow morning so i'm having to stay up late again to work on that but hopefully all my assignment i'll be doing friday won't be too difficult so can actually get them done and go to bed early 'cause am exhausted and might be going out with friends uh friday night and saturday which will be really nice but i'm still debating whether or not should stay and do an homework rather than that um but could [inaudible] trying to do homework saturday morning and then have [inaudible] sunday so might stay [inaudible] but will see do have shopping to get few things so we'll see 
163,today went fairly well and was exhausted 'cause stayed up way too late last night um 'cause was busy and on top of that just wasn't feeling well in general which sucks um but class was really nice at least and got lunch and dinner with the same friend and made some plans for this weekend and for next week so i'll be pretty busy but am also looking forward to it i'm debating going out with friend tomorrow night might just stay in since haven't been feeling well and need to do quite bit of homework so guess we'll just have to see whatever happens um and other than that um everything been going okay i'm just considering going to the doctor and i'm little stressed because of some stuff going on with my family back home but there not too much can do about it other than offer support and talk to them um so hopefully they'll all work it out 
165,um so today was okay had sort of rough night last night um so today wasn't feeling super great and sort of spent the day not doing anything um which really wasn't good because i've i'm planning on going out with friend tomorrow to get some errands done and also have quite bit of homework um and just have one class that watching lot of films and really reading heavy um but if really focused more should be able to get everything done no problem um 'cause it not too difficult just time-consuming um and um it should be okay if just get up early and get little bit done before leave with my friend to go shopping and then whenever come back then can finish the rest and i'm meeting with someone to go over uh one of my psats so that'll definitely help as well um 'cause that'll ensure that it get done on time and everything um so that'll be nice 
166,today was all right um got all my work done although i'm just little bit behind on things because didn't really do anything yesterday and should have especially 'cause tomorrow have an extremely busy day so don't know if i'll have any time um to really do homework which is bad 'cause have pretty big assignment due tuesday and lot of reading have to do for another class on on tuesday um so overall i've been pretty busy plus i'm not feeling super well um which isn't good because have so many things to get done and do hope that start feeling better before thursday because have um big party to just to go to with all my friends to one of my friends birthdays um so really want to be in good place to have good time so would have to try and get all of my other stuff done ahead of time hopefully can do it but on wednesday [inaudible] only have one class and work that [inaudible] doing an work until friday or saturday so that have little extra time it disappointing because needed to go shopping today so [inaudible] plans um so probably won't go shopping [inaudible] this party and if do it'll have to be briefly [inaudible] [21] store in the area which [sucks] and not too much [inaudible] on it because have quite few [inaudible] so hopefully i'll still be able to find something and hopefully everything will turn out all right in the end especially with the party 
167,today has not been going well stayed up way too late last night because of my roommate um and had really busy day today so didn't get done lot of the things that wanted to get done um which resulted in me staying [up lot] later because also had extracurriculars had to go to um and even when came back my roommate was distracting me and [inaudible] so was basically unable to finish my homework so i'm still awake trying to finish an assignment that due at 1000 am tomorrow do has busy day tomorrow as well um basically i'll be busy until after o'clock so hopefully an time after that can just finish my last bit of homework as did most of it in advance for wednesday and go to bed really early 'cause i'm already feeling sick and i've gotten no sleep for the past three night uh which isn't good 
168,today didn't go too well just really felt sick and tired so ended up sleeping again past two of my classes did go to the afternoon one still feel bad for missing the other two um other than that did have meeting with my therapist and that went really nicely um it was really helpful and we scheduled another one in the future which will be nice um and then had dinner with my um working group tonight which was fun it go like really long most of the time uh then got back and managed to get all of my work done and [inaudible] to bed early to make up for all the sleep that i've been missing these past few days uh so hopefully tomorrow can either get up early if feel up to it or just on time [inaudible] [constructive] 'cause need to go to work and get few things done and then have dance practice in the evening on thursday if not um plan [inaudible] as well so need to try and finish all my homework for friday early so plan to get everything done tomorrow between like 500 and 800 when have time because have to go to work or i'll just work an hour and then pick up an hour on saturday to make it up so we'll see but hopefully it will be good 
169,today was all right i'm still feeling really sick so had to skip dance practice but hopefully i'll be able to make that up have practicing only [inaudible] going to practice on saturday um because my performance is next weekend so have to really kinda be on top of it do kinda regret missing it but feel like if had gone would most likely thrown up so it better overall that didn't go um and hopefully i'll be feeling lot better at the night of the performance also really need to try and [inaudible] in preparation for my [inaudible] um but keep forgetting to make an appointment am not sure when would have the free time to do that so [inaudible] can do little bit more i'm excited for tomorrow uh 'cause i'm going to um an friend party and celebrate my friend birthday so it should be lot of fun got to do lot of shopping today [inaudible] dress but [inaudible] stuff [inaudible] so it pretty flattering and something style don't know really well [inaudible] feeling little bit more confident about it and um i've already got an of my homework done for friday so i'll just have to finish it little bit [inaudible] tomorrow and i'll be all set and not have to stress the only thing is that do have to get up early on friday for class and will have to [inaudible] party more so than usual but that will be really awesome and i'm also really happy today 'cause got box in the mail from my mom on tuesday and got to talk to her on the phone for little bit which was really nice 'cause know she been having hard time and i've kind of been having hard time which was [inaudible] to speak with her it was super refreshing and um then friend even came over to my room later which was also really nice um it someone that i'm gonna be blocking with so like hanging out spending time with him 
170,tonight was pretty nice went to party with some of my really close friends and had pretty good time although was kind of sad because someone invited didn't end up showing up and really wish that they had but on the plus side um one of the guys in my [art] class um talked to me and i'm pretty sure they super into me which is really nice to know um because haven't had someone that had crush on me in while and so they exciting and hopefully i'll get to have lunch with him or something like that some time 'cause [inaudible] before but i'm busy so hopefully he'll ask me again 'cause otherwise i'll have to [ring] him and don't really want to hmm but other than that i'm little stressed because have some homework due tomorrow that haven't quite finished don't really know if i'm gonna finish they but they shouldn't be too bad 'cause they only one assignment and i've gotten all of the other work for that class done so they should be okay and hopefully i'll get up when need to get up at o'clock which is what i'm setting my alarm for um so that should be all right at least but we'll just have to see how they goes in the morning 'cause hopefully i'll get all my lab work done and um goes to math which even if just goes to turn in my homework they should be okay because pretty much know what we're doing in math but we'll see 
171,today was all right um got really sick so didn't go to any of my classes um so just spent the day doing homework and he relaxing in my dorm and then the night time spent with friends partying um and wasn't planning on drinking but did end up drinking so now feel more sick than did but hopefully tomorrow it will be okay 'cause need to go to work and also have dance practice and quite bit of homework that need to get done um so hopefully can do it all by the deadline 'cause have something due at noon and on at 500 on sunday and then everything else is due on tuesday um so i'm really glad that we have monday off even though have some extra dance practice to get to but hopefully tomorrow i'll have all the [inaudible] time to rehearse on my own perform on practice we'll just have to see how the day uh work out especially 'cause i've gotta go to work and don't really want to 'cause i'm not really feeling well but hopefully it will be okay 'cause only have to work for like two hours and can get back to whatever else 
172,today was all right still haven't been feeling well [i took] my medicine but it didn't really help um had to go to work um uh which really made me just feel lot worse than had before and other than that had um dance practice which was okay um i'm just yeah looking forward to the show but i'm also nervous about it because need to practice and i'm also super busy um which makes it more difficult um and just my homework is really getting the best of me because haven't been feeling well which makes it hard to focus have so many assignments coming up but hopefully we can get on top of them tomorrow tried to stay up tonight to do them but it just seems like really can't focus or get anything done [inaudible] so think i'll i'll just go to bed and i'll [inaudible] try [inaudible] reasonable time um but i'm not sure that i'll even be able to focus then and may not get all of my assignments turned in which sucks [inaudible] 
173,today wasn't super great um didn't get to bed until late last night um so woke up late and didn't completely finish all my homework but did get it done it all done um but felt really sick worse than have been feeling so ended up taking quite long nap um and didn't feel much better when woke up which definitely sucked but um i'll just yeah how it happens sometimes i've got super busy day tomorrow as well have quite bit of homework that i'm gonna have to catch up on so hopefully won't be feeling as bad and if do still not feel super great i'll probably try and um go to [hohs] some time but don't know fully that i'll have time to tomorrow 'cause i've i've gotta get up and do homework in the morning then i've got meetings dance practice and other extracurricular event so it definitely gonna be super busy and dance practice in particular is gonna be hard um since i've been feeling sick but have got to go [over it] so i've got because we have my shows coming up this weekend and can't not be there for that so hopefully will get better if not don't know what i'm gonna do 
174,today went perfectly well got up on time got some work done that had to do and met with my professor [inaudible] which went better than thought it was going to um and then had little bit more free time to do some homework that didn't initially think that would be uh able to do and so got that done but [inaudible] costume so [inaudible] that and then [inaudible] the downside is that am not doing super [inaudible] dance need to practice little more and my [inaudible] is on thursday so that little stressful and since i've been sick it definitely made it lot more difficult um to practice and to be on top of it in rehearsal also we was having some extra rehearsal um so that actually definitely helped 'cause there was only few things that need to work out to be prepared and other than that just need to send my homework so that can um not be stressed out when have to dance 
175,today was all right was pretty tired but made it to class on time got all my assignments in um and had fairly good day got some stuff in the mail which was super awesome 'cause had been expecting it um didn't have time however to finish my homework before had to go to dance practice but that should still be all right because um have more free time tomorrow 'cause only have one class so even though i'm getting to bed late hopefully my day will be little bit more relaxed and can get to bed early 'cause don't actually have anything to do on thursday for once which is blessing um and am super excited because had dance practice tonight dress rehearsal and it went really well so had been super nervous the night before but am slightly less nervous because actually semi-know what i'm doing which is really awesome feeling um to have just because i've been working for this for so long and now it finally actually happening my show is in two day and i'm [inaudible] because we're also having some extra practice tomorrow which will help me to go over dance one especially which am still struggling with little bit so hopefully i'll get it all down and then just have to prepare for busy week next week 
176,today went pretty well only had one class um so made it on time and had fairly good time 'cause got to work with someone that like um so that was fun and then after that had to meet up with someone from my sorority uh uh which was pretty good [inaudible] to meet her you know and she friends with someone else know which was super [valuable] to find help um and then [inaudible] had to [inaudible] and oh got job offer which was also awesome but it all makes it really hard for me to decide what want to do with my [family and everybody else waiting] back home but feel i'm not sure if should stay um and work but am worried feel like i've [inaudible] things to [inaudible] but feel like it also worth it to stay here and do this for the summer but i've got little bit of time to decide um 'cause have other things to worry about 'cause i've got dance performances starting tomorrow [inaudible] saturday and have paper due next tuesday midterm monday and another midterm tuesday that am definitely less than prepared for um which is unfortunate but all can do now is um study really really hard on sunday um to try and be ready for it and hope for the best um and other than that it going okay i'm not doing terribly well in my class but i'm also not doing terribly so hopefully it'll get better after spring break when have little bit of time to relax this time i'm gonna try and go back home [inaudible] 
177,today went really well um my classes were fine not great but fine and um got chance to practice my dance during the day which were fun um and then we had my first performance this evening which were really cool um were little bit nervous so did mess up tad bit but nothing major so were super happy about that and looking forward to doing all of the other performance so i've got one tomorrow and two on saturday the only downside is that have lot of stuff due next week um but hopefully can take some time to catch up on all of it tomorrow um 'cause dance doesn't get [inaudible] um so then can come home and and do some work and on saturday same thing which might take some work up there with me working on my essay or studying for my midterms um 'cause i've got two midterms next week as well um and other than that um also have to do some application that due by sunday that i'm really excited about 'cause am hoping get the job so we'll see how that goes 
178,today went pretty well my first class was nice worked with someone that really enjoy working with felt like like pretty much understood the material but do have test on tuesday that i'm definitely not ready for as well as test on monday and an essay i'm not [inaudible] ready for and my [inaudible] um starts uh it ships this weekend tried show tonight that went really well um but was upset because after it um it lost one of the pieces of my costume so had to let my choreographer know um luckily she was really nice about it anyway i'm gonna try and get it worked out tomorrow 'cause i've got two show um 'cause don't don't have to get up super early but just little early um might try to be earlier so can go grab yogurt and coffee um just from the shop in my dorm um instead of getting breakfast before go and i'm considering taking an of the work to do 'cause have to watch an entire move um to write response to by sunday so definitely stressed just need to get through all this stuff and then i'll have nice break at spring break so just gotta push through hopefully i'll be able to focus on my study for my test and everything do pretty well 
179,today was good uh my last day of [redacted] um which was fun um both performances went really well and got to see quite few of my friends which was really awesome um and managed to get some work that need to get done finished but tomorrow i'm gonna have to um do quite bit as well just 'cause i've got two tests and some essay that i'm little behind on because i've spent so much time on the [redacted] stuff um but it should still go all right at least and uh we'll just we'll have to see um um i'm not really sure but have been really stressed and busy um so i'm glad that spring break coming up 'cause i've already booked my flight home so that'll just be some time to recuperate and come back to um really be on top of it for the next semester but don't know and i'm still debating my summer plans 'cause have few options and i'm not sure which one will be best um 'cause wanna see my family but also need to do stuff for my future um career so i'm probably gonna end up staying on campus all summer but we'll see 
180,today didn't go pretty well at all um was feeling pretty depressed and my back was hurting 'cause of all of the dance that i've been doing so basically um slept in late and then spent the whole day in my bed working on stuff um it pretty difficult 'cause didn't get to meet with my tutor so was having really tough time with some of my homework and am still working on it and didn't get enough done 'cause i've got midterm tomorrow that am definitely not prepared for and midterm and some essay on tuesday neither of which i'm prepared for so i'm definitely extremely stressed out but know that after get done with these two day everything will slow down again and then i'll have spring break where hopefully can take some time to get back on top of everything 'cause i'm really excited to see my family 'cause i'll be going home for about eight day which is short amount of time but still fun so it should be nice 
181,today [wasn't good] day didn't feel super great and definitely should have gotten more sleep stayed up late doing homework um and was tired basically all day long um which wasn't great 'cause had midterm today which wasn't really ready for so missed one of my other classes um because was studying for the midterm um which isn't good 'cause it the same classes that missed two weeks ago and the midterm for that classes is coming up too guess just need to prioritize better um especially because was busy with my dance performance this weekend which really cut into study time still feel like it was worth it um also have midterm uh tomorrow that haven't studied for at all because was preparing for the other midterm and my essay that was due so everything is just piling up but it okay 'cause tomorrow is my last super busy day and then hopefully can come down focus get back on top of everything and [inaudible] all right my friend is coming this saturday so hopefully seeing her will be okay um and maybe i'll get to go shopping with my roommate which i've been wanting to do for about month and half um 'cause really need to get some stuff and then have um to finalize some summer plans which i'm gonna work on doing and i've got some interview for job opportunity that really hope that get because have been wanting it for basically the last semester so hopefully that'll go well 
182,today was all right um woke up and was pretty exhausted 'cause had trouble getting to sleep last night uh but still managed to get to all my classes and they was all right um did have test this evening that wasn't really ready for um and feel like they went mildly okay [inaudible] great or anything um only have one classes tomorrow which will be nice 'cause also have to go to work and i'm planning on um watching two films for classes so hopefully i'll get to see some of my friends [inaudible] um and i'm supposed to have lunch date with someone which could be fun but could just be super awkward so we'll see um stayed up little bit later than wanted to because started working on some personal stuff but they was pretty relaxing so guess they was worth they 
183,today was all right woke up late but only have one class and that went okay but somehow frustrated 'cause whenever asked her helped on my work um my ca didn't actually help me um and just chatted with some other people um which is definitely frustrating but luckily had meeting with my tutor later on so she explained things little bit more clearly um other than that had um fun lunch date that was really nice and really enjoyed talking to the girl that met with um and after that went to work for bit uh which was hard 'cause did-didn't have enough time to finish everything wanna do today um so have to go back on friday but it shouldn't be too bad and then saturday my friend is supposed to be coming here from texas but haven't heard from her so we'll see what happens with that 'cause have lot of things that need to do otherwise the mid-term [inaudible] sunday and then later we'll [inaudible] so [inaudible] the regular homework on top of that [inaudible] is coming for class next week um and they're really gonna do shopping this weekend [inaudible] guess we'll just have to see what have time for which is like it not going to be lot sadly but guess that whatever um and also went to watch party for class tonight which was nice 'cause got to see two of my friend there which was really cool 'cause one of her didn't even know was in the class and so [inaudible] [inaudible] got pretty bad headache so it gonna be hard to focus on anything after that 
184,today was all right woke up late but still managed to get to class on time which was nice and then got lunch with friend um that normally we never have meals together so that was really cool um didn't do great in math class today but should be better tomorrow we'll see um and then later had to book some flights and file some financial information which was all very stressful um but at least it done now and now still have lot of stuff to do so i'm just glad spring break coming up but before can go on spring break have to write midterm essay um that definitely haven't even started um so i'll probably do class and work and homework tomorrow and saturday one of my friend is supposed to be coming but haven't heard from her so we'll see and if she doesn't might go shopping or if doesn't i'll probably just try and get my midterm started we'll see 
185,today was fine keep not being able to fall asleep at night which is strange little bit of an issue [inaudible] tired the next day um so woke up late but still made it to class on time um and then only had one other class and had an time in-between that was planning on going to work but the weather was super bad so didn't and after that just ended up um doing an homework which was still good i'm hoping to manage to get little bit of homework done tonight because tomorrow i'm planning on going shopping and i'll also have to make up the work that couldn't do today tomorrow um but it should still be all right do have quite few assignments 'cause next week is going to be really busy and i've got an interview and another event on sunday which means that the majority of my homework will have to be done tomorrow and so hopefully i'll be able to focus and really do it there also party that might wanna go to but we'll see what happens still need to check in and see if any of my friends is going 'cause if they're not then probably won't either but hopefully actually get up on time to go shopping since i'm going to bed later than planned again um but still should still be all right 
186,good day it was really fun woke up pretty early went shopping with my roommate and just got to spend little too much money but think have lot of things that really really like so guess it was huge [inaudible] still um other than that spent the afternoon relaxing and doing homework [inaudible] to work today which was good um and then spent the evening going out 'cause my roommate wanted to which didn't plan on doing but it turned out to be lot of fun 'cause got to see lot of friends and also meet lot of really nice new people um and ran into my old ca-captain who gave me advice for an interview that i've got tomorrow which was super awesome 'cause i've been worried about it but um it was really good to to talk to him um 'cause now i'm feeling kinda more confident about doing the interview and i'm really really hoping that get the job 'cause it will just be awesome so we'll see how it goes um and then uh i've got quite bit of homework and test stuff to get ready but can pace it out little bit um so that don't have to do all of it tomorrow um should should still be okay especially 'cause spring break is coming up and if i'm able to focus back home i'll be able to get lot of stuff done then as well which will be really awesome and also getting to see my family it gonna be great literally cannot wait 
187,today was okay woke up on time so had time to shower and get ready before had to go to my interview um my interview went fairly well um was little bit rattled at the end because it was [interrupted] but it still went all right and i'm really hoping that get the job because it would be really good for me but was also glad 'cause found out that can work um for the same place over the summer which would be nice 'cause think i'll be um staying on campus over the summer instead of going back home which will be really stressful and know my family is gonna be super upset i'm gonna have to let them know when go home for spring break but feel like it definitely worth it 'cause get to take class and um work to make money and uh just get to spend time sort of figuring out life for myself without having other stresses uh such as my family and my roommate and things like that so hopefully the summer will be really really productive um [inaudible] not as nice because have meeting today so i'm glad got my homework done at reasonable time though am little bit worried 'cause have midterm that about to be due that haven't even started and i've got quiz and an exam but um hopefully it'll all be all right we'll see 
188,today was pretty good woke up on time and got ready and was little bit more dressed up today um [math] was okay it was little frustrating because um uh we didn't really get anything done that would actually help us on our [psat] which was frustrating um and then went to our other class which was also um not productive because it class where you really don't actually have to go to lecture to know what going on um but did get some other stuff done during that time um and then spent the evening with some friends we went out to dinner which wasn't great but it was okay um then had um some [inaudible] after that which is why am now working on our homework so late um because wasn't able to earlier tomorrow is also gonna be super busy have quiz that haven't studied for but do have some hour before the quiz that can use to look up for some information so hopefully it'll still go all right and i'm getting our midterm back tomorrow graded um so we'll see how that turns out because don't think that did particularly well on it but who know hopefully just did well enough 
189,today was all right um and we've been to to class this morning and it was okay um had paper back that did pretty well on so was [inaudible] about that got test back as well that didn't do so well on um but did okay enough and i'm gonna talk about it with one of my tfs 'cause think there are some issues with how it was graded um other than that i'm kinda stressed out 'cause have lot of stuff to do and not lot of time to do it especially 'cause it housing day so will want to be to focus on that rather than do my work but have got mid-term too that quite bit of reading usually in lot of different sources mm which can be little bit uh stressful um but it should be all right because have been keeping up fairly well with semester um so hopefully it will end up going okay um and it worth like 30 of my grade so long as pass it it pretty good grade then can do better on the final um i'm just really looking forward to having fun with my [blockmates] um so it should be good 
190,today has been pretty good um class went okay and then went to work which was really nice um and then had to focus on work because has quite bit to do and tomorrow is housing day um so i'm going after [school] after i'm working really need to get more stuff done tonight but i'm also hanging out with my friends for housing day so i'm not getting done as much as wanted to but luckily finished some of my other friday homework so really only has to focus on single assignment although it pretty major one that takes quite bit of work so hopefully i'll still be able to finish it was also pumped because got some really good news this evening that got the job had been wanting so i'll be looking forward to doing that um later in the spring and looked into class i'm gonna takes over the summer so i'm feeling little bit more excited about that am pretty stressed but i'm also very very very ready to get back home to my family and am super excited to find out what house we're gonna live in for [inaudible] in just few hours and think it'll be the house for the next three years with my blockmates so that should be fun and we're having really good evening um might [drink] later but i'm not sure should 'cause really need to focus on my work so we'll see what happens 
191,today was all right um went to bed super late last night and woke up super early because it was housing day um which was lot of fun but also wasn't great because had lot of work to get done and barely any time to do it because we had [semi] events so am little bit frustrated that my teachers made stuff due today um when it also knew that it was housing day so stayed up this late because had to finish really important assignment and midterm and i'm honestly not too certain on how well did on it but guess all can do is wait and see now um and i've got lot to do tomorrow because i'm heading back home on saturday and i've got an sat sunday for another one of my classes so i'm gonna have to go to my classes tomorrow go shopping and get packing and prepare to go home and my [plane] is super early so it'll involve me waking up at ridiculous time or just not getting any sleep at all so we'll just see whatever happens um and hopefully my flight not delayed or canceled or anything because am ready to be home for week 
192,today was all right and really didn't get any sleep last night 'cause was studying [inaudible] mid-term um so that wasn't good 'cause was went to class exhausted and [inaudible] proud of it and didn't really know what was going on with the class um but managed to get through it and then had lab which actually went pretty well um [inaudible] kinda talk about it [inaudible] some extra studying for that course which hope catch up on some of my work over spring break but it is only week which seems like no time and i'm gonna have to try and see all of my family and friends especially 'cause i'm not gonna be back home over the summer at all basically um [inaudible] be difficult mm-hmm am very stressed 'cause have to try and make it to my plane on time and it leaves early and i've got some essay that due sunday at midnight and haven't even started yet and i'm gonna do some reading to catch up on it but i'll see how it goes it shouldn't be too bad should be able to work on it at home if have to um and then other than that um i'm just not feeling well 'cause i'm tired i've gotten no sleep so i'm really trying to sleep for bit before have to leaves super early um to make it to my plane on time um and this week off will be nice do have few things that have to get done [over] it other than schoolwork but should still have good time being back with my family 
193,today was pretty good because was heading home for spring break um got few things done that needed to get done and then had an extension on something that was due at midnight um which was good because was having trouble getting the software to work 'cause it was an online things and it little bit more stuff set up for my job this summer which was great 'cause was worried about doing that um the only downside is that have an essay due tomorrow night that still haven't been able to start because was spent lot of the day on the plane traveling um so i'll just have to write the whole things tomorrow but it shouldn't be too bad other than that finally got to see my family which is awesome but had to [inaudible] 'cause wouldn't be home at all over the summer and it took it pretty well probably better than expected but it was still really difficult um but i'm still definitely gonna do the summer program because it super beneficial for me but it did open up the possibility of people coming to visit me which would be super cool 'cause i'm really hoping that maybe we can get that to happen since won't be home at all really mean max maybe week or two so that would be really awesome if someone could come visit me instead 
194,today was pretty nice i'm back home with my family for break so got to sleep in whole bunch woke up few times at night but it wasn't too bad um and felt really great today after sleeping for so long um but also [inaudible] unexpected tonight turned it in little bit late because forgot about the times zone difference and think it probably not super good but it was only rough draft so i'm looking forward to improving it in the future tomorrow should be all right 'cause have um [work bit but] it won't be all day long and hopefully while i'm there can get few assignments or um club stuff finished so we'll see how that goes 
195,today woke up little bit late 'cause went to bed super late last night um wasn't feeling super well but that okay and had to go to work so did that and just napped in the car before and after work which was nice and it was cool 'cause got to spend the day with my mom and one of her employees who actually really good at his job so don't mind working with him because he tries hard and he knows what he doing um other than that probably should've worked this homework today but decided to take break um and not do anything which means should really get stuff done tomorrow but we'll see whe-whether or not that happens um i'm also trying to make plans with my friends to hanging out since won't be coming home at all over the summer so this is the only time that i'll get to see her until next winter so um hopefully we'll be able to make plans even though don't wanna spend too much time with her 'cause i'd rather spend the time with my family members we'll just see what happens 
196,today was all right and then got got my hair cut finally which was nice since haven't done that since like before winter um other than that had to work um which you know was okay got my knees and hips really started hurting so i'm gonna have to go to the chiropractor tomorrow to um get an adjustment which will definitely make me sore for about day but it will also really help um i'm also going to hang out with my friends tomorrow which you know should be okay but i'm not like super looking forward to it or anything because lot of it is sad but whatever um just know that won't see them at all after break so kinda have to hang out with them now um we is going shopping which will be nice since [inaudible] that don't need to spend too much money so hopefully can have self-control but we'll we'll just have to see and then i'm spending the night with my grandmother which will be lot of fun so i'm looking forward to that 
197,today was pretty good woke up not feeling super well but other than that um i'm [inaudible] go to work that was okay um and [inaudible] thought like little bit [inaudible] nothing too bad [inaudible] really manageable um and had plans to go to [inaudible] afterward so had to work all day um and [inaudible] glad to hang out with my friends hadn't been too excited about it when first made the plans 'cause actually [inaudible] them it was lot of fun so was really happy that did it 'cause [inaudible] get chance to see see [inaudible] again before have to go back to school um i'm [looking] to see one of them but probably not both um have [inaudible] another friends on friday but that will probably be less fun so am glad went tonight although probably did end up spending little bit too much money definitely more than had planned on spending or wanted to spend but it was probably worth it um so that nothing too bad um other than that have some things due tomorrow so have to work on that um have to get my homework finished because it not too long now before i'm gonna have to go back to school so i'll spend tomorrow at work and doing homework do have to get up kind of early later than lot of the other day i've been getting up so it shouldn't be too bad 
198,last night spent the night over at my grandmother um this morning got to sleep in little bit later before heading home to work which was nice but in the night got nosebleed which was not fun at all so think i'm gonna try and start doing the nose sprays whenever that stops happening 'cause it happened at school few times even though went to the doctor about it and he didn't really tell me anything to do um so that was frustrating but other than that work was okay did sort of get into fight with my father about some work stuff um so that didn't go over well but the rest of the evening was enjoyable 'cause just worked with my mom and my brother and some employees and the employees was catching on more than thought so that always nice to see um and then my aunt and uncle came by and hadn't gotten to see them yet so that was really cool got to talk for bit i'm not sure i'll see them again before leave for [redacted] but it did mention coming to visit me this summer which would actually be really happy about 'cause i've been trying to convince family members to come and visit me since i'll be spending all summer not being home um so if it do and few other do that would be really cool um it always nice to see them and had plans to hang out with friend tomorrow but he had to cancel last minute so he changed it to saturday instead which will actually end up working out better um and [could] put little bit more of times frame on it 'cause don't wanna end up hanging out with them for super long times 'cause when went to hang out with friend the other night it ended up being for few hours and hadn't intended it to be that long so hopefully this one will be lot more doable um because my main goal is still to spend times with my family before anyone else so i'm am like seeing my friend but [really wanna make] more of some effort to see my family members um so having limited times to be able to hang out really helps that quite bit um so that should be good 
199,today um woke up [inaudible] super tired because went to bed late last night again um and went to work but fell asleep in the [class] [inaudible] ended up not going in until like 1030 which is basically when we open but it was still fine um then didn't feel too great during the workday because um i'm feeling [a little] like cramps and stuff um so that was little bit frustrating and then because i'm working with new employees it don't really know what they're doing yet which means that have to work lot harder to make sure everything goes out right and on time doing my own job while um watching them and doing quality control but did get to see some relatives and some of my other family friends that came at the restaurant which was kind of nice um then afterward we um went out for dinner but it was super late so was just tired and grouchy and really out of it um and hopefully tomorrow i'll be hanging out with my friends and hopefully can leave work early to do some homework because we've been so busy at work that haven't been able to do any of what wanted to get done which definitely sucks so uh if not possible i'll just [inaudible] work late tomorrow to do my homework since i'm going back to school on sunday 
200,today woke up not feeling too well again because of cramps and stuff um so took little bit longer than thought would to get ready um but really just since wasn't feeling well perhaps that uh and work and did spend the morning [following] more slowly and not really helping out as much um because took some medicine and tried to sit down for bit then when felt better started helping out more which is good and then hang out with one of my friends slightly later in the day which is good because needed to see him before leave left um tomorrow and we had fun time going around got present for my roommate and have some other stuff for my [blockmates] so that'll be nice for when go back um but on the downside i'm really behind on the homework that was supposed to do over break so i'm gonna have to try and do it tomorrow while spending time with all of the family that didn't get to see otherwise so hopefully have time to finish everything because i'm gonna be pretty exhausted so going back to school and immediately being exhausted so it not going to be the best thing to happen 
201,today was getting ready to leave and go back to school but then it turned out that my flight was delayed so just switched it to tomorrow which is little bit more difficult because had to turn in all of my homework online so hopefully the teachers will still accept it since couldn't really control my flight um but we'll see when it email me back tomorrow have presentation in class on tuesday that i'm kind of nervous about and got quite few things to get done right when get back to campus um so i'm definitely really stressed and honestly i'm at point where don't even want to go back to school which is really difficult for me because [i'd been away] since december and i'm it really not good because know that need to do it just have to find the motivation i'm not sure what going on but think i'm gonna try and talk to my therapist about it the next time meet with her and maybe i'll figure it out 
202,today returned back to school um so had to wake up really early and go to the airport which was okay but really wasn't feeling well which made it difficult especially being on plane for so long so when finally did get to school was not feeling well at all and ended up just showering and taking nap which was not good because have lot of homework to do um but then later when um woke up had extracurricular things so did that came home and hang out with some friends so ended up staying up pretty late to do my homework but did nap well so it should be okay and hopefully can spend little bit of time napping tomorrow because only have one class on wednesday so definitely need to catch up on my sleep and try and get back into the routine of school and catch up on the work that i'm behind in um but i'm also really excited because we're having big little week this week with my sorority and think it'll be super awesome um already got some email from my big and we start getting gifts and stuff on wednesday so i'm really looking forward to that um and have plans with my friends for friday night and thursday evening so hopefully that'll all be super fun and lastly have presentation tomorrow that i'm little bit stressed about but it should be okay because have partner and we prepared for it um other than that hopefully i'll just be able to wake up on time since still haven't finished my homework and i'm already really sleepy 
203,today was just good woke up on time made it to class on time but didn't have time to shower this morning but it okay 'cause showered last night um [so that was still fine] um and then was gonna have lunch but feel like [inaudible] not good anymore so did still eat some of it but not [inaudible] doing um and other than that had class and went shopping and cleaned up my room because someone supposed to be coming over tomorrow [inaudible] did my homework in semi-timely fashion probably could've focused little bit more 'cause kept getting distracted but still got it done and feel like it went really well so i'm pretty pleased about that um especially 'cause had really productive workshop where felt like my [ca] really helped me understand some stuff had been having trouble with which was awesome hmm and i'm expecting to get pretty major grade or two [inaudible] tomorrow so we'll see how that goes and did get [inaudible] grade back today that felt like was pretty good all things considered so that was nice um and then also have plans on friday with my friends which will hopefully work out because think it'll be lot of fun 
204,today was pretty good woke up with plenty of time and only had one class and it went really well 'cause got to work with people that really enjoy working with and feel like we was really productive and really understood what was going on and then went for my tutoring and finished almost the entire pset which was absolutely awesome because then i'll have less work tomorrow especially 'cause i'm little bit behind with my next [inaudible] so i'll need to refocus little bit um and also had work today and worked for longer than normal which was actually really nice because i'll make little bit more money um when get my next paycheck um which is cool and then other than that got [inaudible] for my new [inaudible] today which was super duper awesome and just really nice to have someone more [inaudible] present in your room for you and did make some plans um with friends um to possibly go out together so i'll be looking forward to that [inaudible] um tomorrow supposed to be quite cold and snowy so hopefully i'll wake up in enough time to shower early so my hair won't freeze on the way to class again but we'll see because intend to sleep in as long as possibly can um yeah that why get the most of my stuff prepared the night before so hopefully it won't be too bad in the morning 
205,today was pretty good was little bit late to class but not too bad um and it was really productive period felt like really got ahead on my work and had meeting with the teacher that was little apprehensive about but feel like it went fairly well and hopefully can be prepared for the next test and my next class and everything tomorrow will be little bit busy just because have my really long lab and need to do some stuff beforehand to get ready for it but i'm also meeting with another teacher um but it'll be good because it go over some work that gonna be do next tuesday um and feel like i'm fairly well prepared know need to do little bit more search for some evidence but that shouldn't factor too much into my discussion tomorrow because that just something that know have to get done um and hopefully i'll be able to schedule time to go the writing center before have to turn in the paper which means i'll have to stay on top of it i'm planning on devoting most of my saturday to working i'll probably leave the room and go study somewhere else can really focus um other than that already did work this week because wanted to do that [inaudible] which is good because that gives me more time for homework um which i've really been trying to stay on top of and then there was also party tomorrow evening that said would go to but i'm still debating gonna see what my other friends decide so probably [inaudible] off that just be haven't really been feeling up to the party mood um so we'll we'll just have to see and hopefully can get everything done before the lab tomorrow 'cause don't have too much time because i've got class and meeting before it 
207,um today woke up pretty late because got to sleep in um from last night which was definitely kind of mess um but had lot to get done because have bunch of stuff due for sunday um but one of the things that needed to watch it [inaudible] for class um and that definitely took long time so did that did some of my other work um but also took nap since wasn't feeling too well so probably should've gotten some more done but do have meeting with someone tomorrow so i'll finish homework then and then i'll shouldn't it shouldn't be too difficult to get my other homework done hopefully but we'll see am definitely worried about money have been working but i'm worried that it still not gonna be enough um 'cause now have extra due for stuff but we'll see how it goes i'll try and work extra this week worked extra last week too and was supposed to get paid for the study i'm doing but haven't and [it time] end up asking about that as well just because definitely don't wanna be short on money 
208,today was pretty good um was really busy with my homework but did get it done even though it was pretty late when fi-finished um but other than that just had little some small frustrations [with friend] um there was some drama back home with my family but should be okay can talk to my mom and my little sisters [a lot] um but other than that was just trying to get all my work done so hopefully [inaudible] [so all my stuff isn't] going too well um and have pretty busy few weeks coming up and all the [inaudible] always seem to be busy but at least i'm excited tomorrow because i'm gonna have little segment to find out who my date is although the timing is kind of poor because have [inaudible] event at the same time that won't be able to go to um but hopefully it is still okay think can make up for other event that have to miss by going to [inaudible] later hopefully um and i'm just really stressed about assignments due on tuesday other than that i'm pretty much on top of my stuff more or less that is um but should be able to talk to my professor bit about this essay um and can try to go to the writing center if need to hopefully just [inaudible] me to be able to really be on top of it 'cause sometimes you just have to get into the mindset to be able to write something well so we'll see how it go um but yeah other than that don't really know just gotta you know get some stuff done 
209,hmm today was lot of fun um went to my classes on time woke up ahead of time didn't feel too tired or anything although didn't feel super well this morning it wasn't too bad um so think overall the day went really well had really good time because in the evening had lot of um plans and it was lot of fun um got to hang out with [inaudible] he comes with friend of mine and got to hang out with my other um good friend which was super nice 'cause we made plans for this weekend um and had few surprises today had little get-together in my honor which was quite fun um and then spent the evening working on my essay which was definitely struggle but feel like it ended up in really good place um so i'm feeling pretty solid about what submitted and really looking forward to getting it back 'cause know won't have it back for few weeks um have kind of busy day tomorrow um especially 'cause had to reschedule meeting with my teacher for tomorrow rather than doing it later in the weeks like had wanted to but hopefully that goes all right because don't have too many things that have to goes over with her um so she'll only take about 30 minutes and then i'm [inaudible] train to get to my work definitely early since have handful of classes on wednesday so that can goes to work and focus on doing some laundry and some other stuff um and then hopefully spend little time uh talking to my family members which got to do today but not too much so it although today it was also pretty busy in addition need to start studying because have tests coming up next weeks and definitely want to do better on the second exams than did on the first ones so i've been trying to focus on studying lot 
210,today has been all right um woke up and got to sleep in little later since had all my stuff ready for class last night um which was really nice since stayed up so late working on my essay and then talked to few people from the same class felt better because they had said that they also spent quite bit of time on their essay as well and had to stay up late um so thought that was pretty good sign um other than that had two class and they all went fine as well but did feel little bit out of they and disconnected from my family today but has had decent [inaudible] before so know that i'll probably be better tomorrow um and even if not they fine i'll just go about my work 'cause i've got [inaudible] my job tomorrow um and i've got two tests coming up next week so i'm trying to be on top of that and has friend who wants to hang out this weekend and i'm really looking forward to going out with their so hopefully we are able to do that but we'll see 
211,today was still feeling pretty off even though went to bed really early last night ended up waking up pretty late anyway was almost late to class so guess i've just generally been feeling out bit but did get all my homework done for friday and [inaudible] some lab prep need to do that'll be [inaudible] tomorrow morning pretty busy um i'm glad that [inaudible] make lunch plans with some people that know um so that should be fun guess um [inaudible] might be little bit awkward but hopefully it'll turn out all right um and then [inaudible] so went to work today which was frustrating and awkward and even forgot to sign out so have to go back probably tomorrow or another day to fix that it should actually okay 'cause it'll only take like two minutes um and then i've been forgetting that need to do some stuff for another extra-curricular and that should've been done on saturday but should be able to finish before the actual date so that should be okay um other than that april definitely gonna been busy starting with two tests that have next week that haven't been um studying for but hopefully can dedicate saturday to that just need to get on top of some homework that due on sunday um so hopefully that'll be all right but don't really know we'll see just have to focus on and get out of this weird funk that i'm in 
212,today was all right was feeling little bit out of it but mostly on top of everything um got to class little bit late but it wasn't bad and showered this morning which was nice and had time to relax little bit then had lunch with some friends which turned out to be [inaudible] 'cause got to see uh well first got to meet someone new and then got to um see one of the friends had lunch with later in the day which was [inaudible] um other than that my other class was pretty good although didn't pay too much attention and probably should have 'cause have test coming up but [inaudible] test so it not that big of deal um then after that had more time to relax then got to hang out with some [inaudible] that really enjoy talking to so that was awesome um and then spent the evening with friends as well [inaudible] little bit frustrating but it got better afterwards because heard from friends back home that haven't heard from in while and we was having pretty good conversation but was really annoyed because it got interrupted but i'm sure that we'll finish it some other time 'cause know can rely on him and i'll definitely wanna talk to him about stuff because he someone that always gonna be there for me no matter what which appreciate because think he was probably one of the only friends that can consider to be like that um the weekend is definitely gonna be long because test preparation and my roommate have her girlfriend coming over which is gonna be annoying because she wants me to spend bunch of time with her which don't wanna [understand] whatever i'll probably just try and avoid the room or something and prepare for the two test have next week so we'll see how it goes 
213,today was all right wasn't feeling super well but classes wasn't too long and my stuff is relatively easy so had an okay time doing that um and then spent the evening relaxing we did get to hang out with friend which was good 'cause was supposed to see him last night and didn't but after that just was really having lot of trouble um was sort of dissociating and getting into down mood um but then called one of my friend from back home and he really helped lot so hopefully i'll do better um 'cause definitely wasted this evening and i've got two tests and an other stuff that needs to get done for next week um so i'm definitely gonna have to focus tomorrow since i've got fairly busy day on sunday um and i'm supposed to go to friend event tomorrow night too so we'll see what happens 'cause do really want to go but also know that needs to get my work done especially studying for this tests which didn't do super well on the last one um but was glad 'cause made few purchases 'cause got an good news about my finances so that'll help if anything else 
214,today definitely felt really out of it um just felt as if there was something really off um so did not get too much done which was difficult because i've got mid-term monday that i'm super worried about um so hopefully by the time wake up tomorrow i'll be feeling better because do have few things to do on top of the mid-term so hopefully can get everything done and be ready for um my test by studying just have [sort of] travel plan with [redacted] and some other friends um so i've been talking to people on the phone and trying to [get out] which is good but at the same time it takes up lot of time and should just be studying haven't been able to find good place to do that and be productive um it have been more difficult um but um i'll i'll i'll get through it really think this summer and next term will go lot better um and you know one of the main things i'm trying to do is just to distance myself from it all and stop being so concerned unless the partnerships is worth it um but we'll see how that actually go because can say that but actually doing that is completely other things um but i'm i'm definitely trying and just need to get out of this funk pretty quickly 'cause i've got busy day tomorrow 
215,today went pretty well had meeting this morning about work which was nice because got to find out more about what i'll be doing this summer um which was lot of fun but um other than that had um lot of homework to do because have mid-term tomorrow so spent like five hours studying for it and still don't feel prepared at all so i'll study lot more tomorrow as well um especially because today had to um do some extra homework as well so didn't totally dedicate all my time to studying so i'm gonna try and do that tomorrow since the test isn't until 700 pm and only have two classes but also have to wake up early because have some appointment so i'll see how it goes think the important appointment will goes really well think just because i'm gonna talk really seriously to my um therapist and have some stuff to do throughout the week so think this week will be good especially because i'm gonna get super busy starting this weekend so i'm wanna have this [super] relaxing week which it would be better because i'll get my last two test done this week and then just have to worry about finals coming up um so that will definitely help bring my stress levels down and then hopefully can make some time to goes to the chiropractor because my back have been acting up um but we'll just see [inaudible] and i'm just gonna deliberate about this test and hoping it goes well 
216,today was pretty good woke up early and had an appointment that actually turned out pretty well and talked of an stuff for the future uh [inaudible] stuff in the morning with an [clients] which was nice although was scared but it should be okay um mean [inaudible] with friend that haven't seen since like last semester so that was super awesome to get to catch up with that friend and then have plans for tomorrow morning uh so have to get up early once again um to see how that goes [inaudible] and then i'm gonna be heading off to [inaudible] so so started preparing for another [inaudible] through working out and stuff but also have well homework and things um to get done so we'll see how it goes um don't know but i'm really looking forward to going into [inaudible] so it'll be awesome actually um yeah [inaudible] just have to try and get an stuff done 'cause definitely have been pretty busy at the moment so we'll see 
217,today was pretty good had to wake up pretty early and go to meeting this morning um that ran little late so was almost late to my class but managed to make it just before it actually started which was good um and then was little bit tired but it okay because can sleep in little bit later tomorrow morning anyways so it not that big of deal um and on the plus side uh only have one class tomorrow but do have few other thing i'm going for an appointment with [inaudible] to address but that should be good just to get an medicine and then to make another appointment with [inaudible] which i've been trying to do for while and haven't had time so i'm happy that i'll finally get chance to do it tomorrow and then this weekend gonna be really busy which i'm not looking forward to but i'm happy because finally managed to book an appointment with the chiropractor even though it is for next week but after go to that should be feeling better um other than that i've got midterm thursday night that i'm little worried about but honestly feel i'll be prepared for which is cool because in the past haven't um and i'm meeting with my tutor tomorrow to go over an stuff as well which should help and other than that i've got to work tomorrow and um we've got friend coming over um which is pretty nice because never had dinner with my roommate and another friend that didn't know too well um managed to talk to him little bit which i'm hoping i'll kind of get to talk to him one on one in the future because he seems pretty nice and feel like we could be good friend but it kind of difficult 'cause i've found with my roommate she [inaudible] dominates the conversation so hopefully we'll get an chance to talk one on one instead so get to know him better we'll see 
218,today was pretty good had [inaudible] quiz this morning which was frustrating 'cause that one of my least favorite things to do in math um but it didn't go super poorly it was okay don't think i'll get [great grade] on that though because never contribute enough to my group um but i'm not too stressed about it after that um went to work which was really nice because that means i'm done for the week and i've got bunch of trainings and stuff this weekend so definitely had to get it done today um and got to talk to my family while was working bit which was great because hadn't spoken to my grandmother in while and also got to hear from my sister which was cool and then after that met up with my tutor to go over some math stuff and feel really prepared for the midterm which is great feeling because normally think i'm not ready but think could actually do [inaudible] and then after that had doctor appointment which was really good 'cause got lot of stuff um solved but ended up spending lot of money because had misconceptions about the cost of some stuff um which was not cool but guess i'll just have to make it up with work um which shouldn't be too bad and then [got to] spend the evening [meeting] with friends and went to dinner with some friends which was okay but then extra people joined us which was frustrating um but then [inaudible] we ha-hang out with someone that i've [inaudible] and she really cool so think we'll probably start hanging out little bit more which is really nice because feel like friends group is growing and i'm meeting some really awesome people that feel like could become really close to so that was really awesome and think tomorrow will be okay [inaudible] my days is gonna start getting really busy starting this weekend so it should be okay think can handle it 
219,today went all right had really good morning class even though was little bit late to it um but was really pleased because some of my friends asked me to lunch and didn't have to ask them this time which was super awesome 'cause we're all becoming closer and then uh we even had someone extra join me which was cool 'cause hadn't met them before so that was nice and he seems super chill um someone that easy to get along with other than that uh had few homework assignments but got them all done and then had mid-term this evening which thought was ready for but think messed up few time on the actual exam um but it okay think still did not too terribly um so i'll just do corrections and get some points back like that um other than that oh had tea tonight with friends with dinner which was good but at the same time we had dinner with someone um who very loud and my roommate also very loud and they're both super outgoing so it sort of dominated the whole conversation which is difficult for me because don't like talking over people so get to feel really disconnected when that happening um but maybe in the future i'll get to talk to them more one-on-one so feel more comfortable around them um and then it was good because heard from one of my friends back home who been through rough time right now though 'cause he broke up with his fiancee so talked to them for while and think helped them which was nice and then um we had friends over this evening so definitely ended up staying up way later than was planning on it but honestly feel like it was worth it especially 'cause going into this weekend i'm gonna have less time to hang out with friends now as get busier um so it was good to have this little um break and good to see people especially 'cause one of my other friends was also going through hard time so think it was also nice for them to see me and sort of take break and know that we're there for them so that was really cool 
220,today was okay we stayed up way too late last night so was [inaudible] [a bit] tired um but my first class was still fine and then had little time between that and my next class where got to relax and get few things done which was good um and then had lu lab which was little frustrating but we still managed to get out an hour early um so that was nice and then super exhausting but had to talk to friend for bit 'cause he going through rough time so i've been [getting him some] [inaudible] and then went to dinner with an other friend which was good except we was all so out of it barely even talked mostly just sat there and ate but was really happy because got to get an lemonade which had been wanting to do for while and and an cereal and stuff then we came home and just relaxed probably stayed up too late again but can sleep in little bit tomorrow because don't have anything until o'clock and then after that i'm gonna try and spend the whole evening doing homework um because sunday it going to be super-duper busy um so have to really get lot of stuff done tomorrow so hopefully will actually be able to focus and do that um other than that sort of made an impulse buying decision but feel like it'll turn out to be okay there something i've been wanting and managed to get it [on sale too] which was nice so hopefully that'll motivate me to do better um since treated myself little bit so we'll just see how tomorrow goes i'm gonna try and get up little early so have an time to shower and get an stuff done before have to goes to work um get trained for my new job which i'm pretty pumped about so it should be all right 
221,today turned out to be really good um decided to go out even though hadn't been planning on it because this morning woke up to little bit of work and then had training for my job coming up this spring um and after that um went back to the room and got my roommate because she been sick so took her to go um to the doctor and went in and got few things and it was lot of fun but know should probably do homework tonight because wasn't planning on going out but then everyone hadn't hung out with in while texted me so ended up going out with her and the party was all right didn't have too much of great time but it was still pretty fun and then had to get my friend home safely which did and then went to get pizza and it was super awesome because some random person just paid for my pizza so just got some free pizza um and then now i'm heading back to my dorm and i'm not feeling super well and have to get up early tomorrow which sucks but it should be all right because had really nice night so think it was worth going out um and then hopefully i'll have time to get all my stuff done tomorrow and if don't there just one little things that won't matter too much so it should be okay 
222,today had really busy day um spent the morning doing an extracurricular and right after that had to run to training for my job but it went really well um had great time and got to see one of my captains which was cool then had to run to tutor and to get my homework done uh which finished and managed to finish my other homework on time too and then had um another event to go to in the night but it was really cool because found out an great information about all the work starting at the beginning of the summer um like who my mentors are the hours where i'll be working stuff like that and i'm super excited about it and made plans to meet with my mentors later this week so that'll also be really good 'cause i'm ready to start preparing and heard from my sister um and we're going um to thing together so she was just sending me an information which made me really happy 'cause i'm super pumped about it even though it definitely gonna be super busy don't think i'm gonna get enough sleep at all this week but hopefully can get through it we'll see 
223,today was pretty good and was on time to my class um it was okay my regular teacher is gone and the replacement we have wasn't great but he wasn't terrible either so that was all right um and then after that ended up skipping my other lectures 'cause wasn't feeling too well and had laundry to do and [inaudible] stuff to do for um job that have and then made some plans um to get lunch later in the week with friend and talked to my sister about visiting her next weekend got some more information on plans for this weekend um which included making plans with another friend to visit and [inaudible] go out just depending on um how i'm feeling and how we both is over this weekend um and then have um just lot of stuff that due that worked on um which was pretty good and although am still little bit behind but feel bit little bit more confident about my respective class papers um and also found out that have quiz and test next week on the same day um but um feel little okay about the test the quiz is more iffy um need to do some more work on that but hopefully lab have this week will help me out in preparing for that but we'll see have one class tomorrow that i'm really worried about because it section that normally we just have [inaudible] for but this time we're having my actual professor uh um and generally don't like talking in section so really doubt that will talk tomorrow um but we'll see how it go maybe it'll be fine and he won't make me all talk just don't know what he gonna be like 'cause in lecturer he pretty um different than the other professor that i've had so hopefully it'll work out to be okay 
224,today wasn't feeling too well so missed both of my morning classes which wasn't great but talked to my professors so it should be okay and and um other than that did some homework but really just spent most of the day sitting around just because wasn't feeling well then did go to doctor appointment however it didn't actually tell me anything which was definitely frustrating but it should be okay because i'm going to see my chiropractor tomorrow so if anything else that should make me feel at least little bit better 'cause it usually does and then wednesday i've only got one classes but i've got plans with friend which will be nice and then have to go submit form for my summer [inaudible] that shouldn't take too long and then thursday and friday i'm super busy so hopefully [i can get] all my stuff done on time for thursday and for friday and then might have plans to go shopping with friend this weekend and have big event on saturday which i'm looking forward to but little bit nervous about

227,today was okay woke up really not feeling well but this time did actually make it to class on time and class was really small for some reason lot of people didn't come which kind of made me sad but got to work with someone that haven't worked with in while and like her quite bit so that was good and then had some appointment for coffee and it was just someone had never met before but we actually had really really great conversation really enjoyed talking to her and she gave me lot of good advice which made me feel better about how i'm doing um then we made plans for the future together which i'm looking forward to lot because think that could be really good friends with her um and hopefully that'll help me develop as better people in my own life um then spent the evening shopping which i've been wanting to do for while and intended to do in preparation for some exam tomorrow so i'm ready and hopefully the event tomorrow which is going to be long will be all right because i'm not really expecting it to be great but maybe it will be am sad though because my two good friends can't come to it and really wanted her to be able to but can just take some work and hopefully get that done get some emails sent and stuff prepared for next week and next weekend i'll be visiting my sister so i'm pretty excited about that 
228,today was all right had an event all day long that was little bit [inaudible] but not too bad went out of town and just spent lot of time talking on [inaudible] [inaudible] little sad because my two close friends couldn't make it so didn't have anyone that was super good friends with there so instead of staying to myself lot started talking to an of the other girls which was cool and then came back home did little bit of work sent an emails but i've just been feeling super sick and um down so didn't get too much done um then spent the evening with friends and we went to party and it was lot of fun and um just came back home to relax so tomorrow i'm gonna have to focus on doing quite bit of my homework since haven't done anything any today [inaudible] just my essays that i'm worried about my other classes should be all right and do have quiz on tuesday and two presentations coming up [inaudible] hope it will work out will be okay and then will be excited to see my sister next weekend 
229,today was all right slept in um lot because wasn't feeling too well lately um which ended up being really good 'cause then felt better during the day [inaudible] still super out of it and had quite bit of homework to do so got um bunch of it done but still ended up staying awake [inaudible] just 'cause i've got two projects this week and two papers which still haven't turned the abstract in for one and i'm super confused about where i'm going with the other so hopefully i'll have time to meet with my to have tomorrow to talk to him um 'cause [inaudible] regret that haven't turned it in yet well i'll turn it in tomorrow guess and just see how it goes i'm little worried about waking up on time and everything because i'm still feeling pretty sick but hopefully i'll make it and then on tuesday i've got quiz uh and [inaudible] which is really frustrating because need to study for both on top of pretty big assignment due too but this whole week is just gonna be pretty rough and then this weekend i'm going to california so hopefully won't be as sick then because i'm losing my voice and everything and i'll get to see my sister for the weekend which hopefully should be exciting and then i'll come back and have my last few day of classes before um finals and finals should goes all right although that two papers have to write is not gonna goes very well but as long as can just get on him end with in that classes then it should be okay we'll see though 
230,today was pretty good woke up on time to do my first class in the morning um my teacher checked in with me to make sure was doing okay which was nice but also frustrating um and after that took so little of time between class to work on something and then um had to ate some lunch and then had to go to my other class um so did it but didn't feel too well sort of was coughing lot and stuff like that which was frustrating but after class was good because met with my tf and talked to him about her project which was really awesome and then came home and got kind of stuck in cleaning mood so did that for while and then started doing homework but it frustrating 'cause the assignment tough and i've got quiz and test tomorrow that i'm definitely not ready for so have to study for the quiz right before class and hopefully i'll be okay on the test because i'm pretty good at what we're supposed to be doing so it shouldn't be too bad hopefully as long as can remember all of the rules have been should be able to finish that i'm looking to go to bed at least little early tomorrow night so it should be okay 'cause i've got work on wednesday as well so [inaudible] at 300 tonight [inaudible] only got forward little bit 
231,today was all right barely got any sleep last night so that was definitely struggle but still made it to class relatively on time um which that class is just frustrating me it why stayed up so late too and i've got another big assignment due thursday which sucks because that means have to do all of it tomorrow and on top of the project that have due friday and bunch of other stuff because also have an entire paper for that class due sunday so that class is really the only one that causing me whole bunch of trouble if didn't have it then would probably be doing just fine in all of my courses um so don't know about that it just kind of annoying um but you know it whatever and i'll just have to try and get it done because i'm going to visit my sister so guess can work on the airplane and hopefully have it done on time guess can just stay up if need to do it or can work on that on sunday however that sucks because wanna spend time with her but i've got really busy day thursday wednesday my only like relatively free day but got lot of homework and i've gotta go to work which makes it less [three] free and then thursday i've got formal that i'm going to with my friend that i'm super excited about but it is gonna take up all of my evening so won't really be able to do homework then which is why i've gotta try and finish all of it um tomorrow as well as this whole entire paper so that cool but did have test today and feel like it went relatively well i'm trying to be happy about it and had [inaudible] and [inaudible] an test but still think definitely passed at least which is nice so that yeah everything all right i'm just trying to get to bed soon because i'm all jittery from getting no sleep last night and didn't wanna nap today because it would mess up my sleep schedule more so as soon as finish watching film with my friend i'm gonna go to bed 
232,today was [hard for me] um my throat started getting really sore so lost my voice this morning and had group work which was super frustrating because then didn't get chance to actually contribute or help very much but that just how it happens sometimes and still feel like class was productive because understood what we was doing in the end and got jump start on my homework for friday which is good because i've got party tomorrow night that i'm going to with good friend um which will hopefully be fun i'm not sure depending on how many people end up going but there should be smores and stuff so it should be fun regardless and then talked to my sister today uh i'm visiting her this weekend and that was really great 'cause have better idea of what to pack and everything for thursday which was awesome um i'm feeling little frustrated 'cause skipped class earlier in the week for being tired and i'll probably do it again tomorrow um because guess have lot of stuff to do coming up that needs to be done before the weekend um because this is my last week of class so we're having all of my final projects and assignments so needs to try and get ahead tomorrow so might just have to skip that class again the lectures is videotaped so it shouldn't be too bad to catch up and know we'll be going over some of the [information] [inaudible] it should make it lot better but yeah um know [inaudible] to bed late again but that just how it is sometimes 
233,today was all right woke up really not feeling well and had to go to class um and we had [workshopping] thing so we did that and it was fun um got better feedback from my peers than expected um but then got feedback from my teacher [inaudible] later tonight um and it wasn't as good which is upsetting but went ahead and emailed him so that he can help me out and get the paper in the direction it needs to be going to because um it due sunday by midnight and tomorrow fly out to um stay with my sister for the weekend so have to really be on top of everything which sucks because i'm extremely busy so i'll probably be doing homework on the plane or in the airport or maybe just staying up and doing it and not sleeping when i'm over at her place but we'll see how it go um i'm pretty frustrated um just really needs this semester to be over with um i'm not sure um how it gonna end up but hopefully it'll end up okay don't know we'll see think i've done not as well as hoped but well enough in all the class so that should be all right 
237,today was all right made it back to campus it just took little bit of time to get from the airport to here and i'm super [inaudible] started way too late working on my um essay for [inaudible] and some other homework-ey stuff um so was super stressed and just turned my homework in and went home and passed out because was so exhausted um so feel little bit bad that didn't make it to class and know that my teacher is probably gonna ask me what [inaudible] [yesterday] but wasn't feeling well and definitely needed nap because happened to stay up and do homework late into the night uh which did and finished [inaudible] and then feel bit stressed [today] because the printer not working so have to try and get up early and have to go print some stuff tomorrow before class which hopefully i'll be able to do because tend to sleep in until the last possible minute so hopefully will be able to actually make myself get up at some time it was little bit harder than that in california because enjoyed my time there it was super nice and made some good friends um even though only met them for about day and i'll definitely miss my sister ton [inaudible] question why was at harvard just because feel that would be lot happier if wasn't here and [inaudible] and i'll probably need uh for my future but i'm going to talk to my counselor tomorrow so hopefully that will help with me figuring some stuff out 
238,today wasn't great woke up little bit late got to class late um [i finally] did some did some [inaudible] but um it wasn't really that productive um and then had another class and that was basically fine [inaudible] lecture because wasn't feeling too well [inaudible] back that did [inaudible] but it still wasn't [inaudible] and then um had one appointment with my therapist and just got really upset so ended up crying lot and stuff like that and just feel really isolated from everyone else coming back to california [inaudible] i'm in really bad mindset [inaudible] the semester don't don't really know what i'm gonna do about it because it putting me behind in my work and i've got quite few things to do coming up this week and next week yeah um and also there something that wrong with my tooth but don't have time to go to dentist or figure it out or have the financial means because right now can't even pay off my credit card um which is really stressful 'cause it never gotten this bad before um and think lot of it is just due to being in california um but yeah other than that i'm really happy uh and have lot to do to fix it 
239,today was the last day of classes it was okay mean it didn't go particularly great but it [inaudible] waste of time just have to get through finals and then start my job um still [inaudible] my [job] [inaudible] which hopefully will go well have test on friday and need to finish some stuff in preparation for it um it hopefully won't be too difficult we'll see um am looking forward to that job know it definitely gonna be hard to run crew um especially as i'm very introverted person and [inaudible] that it [inaudible] really isolated from person after having come back from california it don't know that am here and what [inaudible] doing [inaudible] i'm friends with the person i'm friends with uh nothing feels like it worth it anymore but just have to keep working and get through it because ultimately this isn't about me or my happiness it just about getting degree and being able to provide for my family and my mom lot of stuff just seems really pointless lately and really don't know what to do to make it better talked to my counselor but it really didn't help and she didn't have anything to tell me um but know just have to stick it out because i'm meeting up with some other friends later in the week and next week that feels communicate little bit better because actually like them get along with them even though i'm not particularly close to them um and yeah really don't know what to do didn't [inaudible] like [inaudible] other stuff so 
240,today was fine woke up on time to go met with my professor it was [inaudible] because he gave my feedback late so hadn't really had the time to [inaudible] before went but it turned out didn't need to worry because the [inaudible] went really well he was super nice and had good time chatting with him especially 'cause might not see him again that [inaudible] to the end of this semester and don't have class with him anymore it was really nice because he had told me how much fun it was to have me in class which appreciated because think definitely struggled little bit but [inaudible] time really had good time as well so i'm glad that he also appreciated my participation [inaudible] this semester then made plans to meet some people tomorrow for some other class especially the one where i've got some essay due next friday coming up um that the professor that have some comments on i'm not too sure about and then had to go over some test corrections for another class and had my dorm crew test which definitely didn't study enough for and i'm gonna have to finish my plans tomorrow but should have time to do that and lot of it is common sense it shouldn't be too difficult to remember how to do it in the moment so think it will be just fine and it will definitely be huge relief to have it over with and i'm just looking forward to actually starting clean up [inaudible] later in may um 'cause that gonna be lot of hard work but also really fun and [inaudible] might [inaudible] so that can get job as captain in the fall so i'm super excited about that and less excited about the test and [inaudible] that is coming up although the discussion had today made me feel lot better about my papers at least so that pretty good 
241,today was pretty good woke up and had meeting with my professor [i thought it went well] and was happy 'cause got [inaudible] done [inaudible] credit [inaudible] which is really good [inaudible] class is coming to close and then had meeting with another tf who was super helpful in giving me some advice about my final assignment so that made me feel lot better about writing that paper as well because he gave me some solid tips um and feedback on my work um and then had [inaudible] meeting which was definitely really nervous about [i think it] went better than thought because it was really just giving me advice rather than um evaluating me too harshly um which was really cool um [inaudible] and spent the evening um going out with friend to dinner and then watching films and hanging out um with some of my other friend which was super nice [inaudible] [inaudible] buy ticket now to one of my formals that thought was gonna be able to do for free but turns out waited too long to get the ticket so i'll end up having to buy it now which isn't cool um but that just how it is sometimes so i'll deal with that as well and then tomorrow i've got to go and do my [inaudible] since didn't do it earlier this week like normally do because was busy on my normal like designated day so gotta do two hours tomorrow and then i've got plans later with some people from my sorority so that'll be fun 
242,[inaudible] [slip in] little bit but didn't go to bed till super late last night so guess didn't really sleep in but it fine um woke up and oh first went to pick up package that finally arrived that i've been waiting [inaudible] month for um so that was fun and then immediately had to go to work which wasn't too bad it was just little bit annoying because set off like fire alarm and stuff which was frustrating but manageable and then finished work and hung out with some friends and did get little bit of studying stuff done gotta [return that] stuff to my teacher tomorrow um and i'm looking forward to tomorrow night because it my house formal so me and my [blockmates] and friends are all going um and it should be really good time although we've got presentation monday morning that are little bit worried about so we'll have to get that done but after that it pretty smooth sailing into friday and then have my first final and [inaudible] essay due which definitely need to have started which [inaudible] um and then finish that tuesday or wednesday and study for my final [inaudible] thursday-ish but [we'll] see how it go are definitely stressed about this final but feel like just need to study lot and hopefully i'll be able to focus and do just that because i'm sort of using this weekend to relax and party little bit so [inaudible] going forward hopefully can really focus for this final because wanna finish out the year like finish it well off um even though know probably are definitely not [going to get] probably not even single but that all right that just how it are sometimes and then i'll be able to start my job and start making money because i've been little bit worried about finances recently just had some extra expenses didn't think would have so hopefully that'll be okay 
243,today was really good slept in super late which was nice because generally i'm not able to do that and then cleaned up my room little bit did some work on the project that we've got tomorrow morning um and then spent the evening hanging out with friends we [inaudible] party for the house [inaudible] which was lot of fun went to my other friends [inaudible] we had great evening so ended up being super glad that went um even though was little iffy about it at first but ended up having really good time think it one of the best nights of this entire year actually which is super cool 'cause i'm glad got to spend it with friends and i'm just not [inaudible] home which isn't great [inaudible] type of presentation super early tomorrow but think [inaudible] and then hopefully after that i'll start working on some essay that i've got due because it due the same day as some exam that i've got so i'll need to do to study for that and do my essay um [inaudible] enough time because both of that things is happening on friday so hopefully can balance that with also having to complete my work hours this week and um tomorrow nights is really busy because of that another [day] [inaudible] going to with some friends and then before that have dinner that have to attend um so think tuesday wednesday thursday is gonna be more so my homework day but also normally work on wednesday so we'll see how that goes 
244,this morning was all right had presentation with my roommate that was really glad to be done with um 'cause it was math which do not particularly enjoy so even though it was little bit difficult 'cause we studied late last night and had to get up early this morning and then we practiced doing it pretty well and the teacher said that it was really good so that awesome um and then got to take nap which was really nice and we went to dinner with my sorority which was okay didn't stay very long though because had plans to talk to my mom on the phone because hadn't talked to her about week and then to get ready for freshman formal which was tonight so went to that and it was actually pretty good was really glad that got to see my friend [redacted] we made plans to hang out before entering the formal um so we did [inaudible] lot of fun and my other friend came over and hang out with us as well which is cool 'cause he super chill and spent the majority of the night at formal with him dancing um which was awesome and ran into quite few friend while was there so it wasn't as fun as the formal went to last night but it was still pretty solid was glad went we got some really cute pictures and that big plus um and then came back and my roommate had another friend over they're actually gonna watch show so [inaudible] with her for bit and probably gonna [inaudible] soon i'm glad 'cause don't actually have to wake up tomorrow which will be super nice 'cause can not set some alarm and sleep in although do need to start reading my essay tomorrow yeah and need to potentially go to work although might end up doing that wednesday or thursday or saturday we'll see 'cause i've got some stuff to do on friday so i'll figure out what day work best 
245,today was fine woke up super late because didn't have to get up for anything um and sleeping in was really nice then didn't find the motivation to do anything all day which wasn't great because i've got two major things friday and then something saturday sunday and tuesday so got quite few things coming up and [inaudible] still really need to go to work um so it definitely been struggle know tomorrow need to [do] basically my entire day to essay writing [do know it's] gonna be little difficult because do have to get up early for an appointment and then [inaudible] um [inaudible] and [inaudible] so hopefully i'm able to [be useful with] my time [inaudible] at least so that can get everything done that need to get done and [inaudible] starting with my exam 'cause that probably the one i'm worried the most about but hopefully i've retained information over the semester and i'm now going over old problems in my old notes restructuring them will be huge help in exam prep and i'm sure that there are an sample essay that could look at as well um so hopefully it won't go too poorly um and other than that i'm looking um looking forward to dinner i'm supposed to have because it with good friend haven't seen in while and we normally talk about an pretty serious stuff so that'll be nice 
246,today was all right got up early because got an appointment um yeah that had to walk to and so was outside for quite bit and since got up early actually went to get breakfast which was pretty nice and got to talk to my mom for while which was also fun um and then came home and took shower and then had to head to an lunch plans shortly after my academic advisor which went okay mean it was just little awkward [inaudible] [inaudible] really good [inaudible] people that don't normally talk to but it was okay and it was [free] food which was nice came home and did an work on my essay [inaudible] meeting with another friend which was fun because also had to meet one of her other friend that [inaudible] um so that was cool and came back and [talked to] my [inaudible] an more which has been going particularly well mean because i'm not feeling good which makes it really hard to focus and do my work but um it should be okay think i'll be able to get it done even if it not exactly to the standard that originally thought it was going to be [too] but it is fairly long and need to finish because i've got an exam the same day so really badly to study for so need to go get [inaudible] my essay and the other [inaudible] on my exam so hopefully tomorrow i'll [inaudible] little bit better and can effectively do that because know definitely need to and i'm frustrated because just got an email from professor to meet to-to-tomorrow to go over an stuff that didn't think was going to do so it pretty frustrating 'cause it very last-minute and really don't has time for it and it mean that may has to get up early again which is fine but also i'll probably be pretty tired since stayed up late working on my essay tonight but if just stay up and get my work done maybe i'll has time for nap or just get to bed at reasonable hour and study an for that same exam on the day of the exam because it not until the afternoon so i'll at least has the whole morning as well to study so hopefully it'll go okay because need to [inaudible] this essay out tomorrow 
247,today was all right ended up sleeping in because haven't been feeling well at all but um [inaudible] woke up and could barely sleep [inaudible] over coffee but [inaudible] had to [inaudible] so did that and did some problems [inaudible] so feel little [inaudible] next week [inaudible] continued and have been working on some essay since then which i'm almost halfway done with and is due tomorrow at midnight so that pretty intense have to go to bed soon because have [inaudible] tomorrow at 200 so need to have time to sleep and then can study for that tomorrow and finish my essay after it i'm super worried about the final but there not too much can do right now hopefully i'll do well enough to pass if not i'll just see what happens which just sucks because it [inaudible] all my final but i'll also get these two done tomorrow i'll be lot less stressed 'cause only have two left and both of which feel i'm well prepared for so that good 
248,today did not go well woke up feeling even sicker than did yesterday um and have an essay and final today um so that [inaudible] wasn't done because i'm pretty sure my final [inaudible] my essay [inaudible] differently [inaudible] [later] and [inaudible] every [inaudible] but it was just [inaudible] [for now] um i'm just hoping that feel better tomorrow 'cause have an assignment [inaudible] and then another essay on sunday and my last [exam] on tuesday so hopefully [inaudible] feel little bit better even scheduled doctor appointment for tomorrow um [inaudible] [through week] [inaudible] and i'm trying to take an medicine [inaudible] [good stuff] [inaudible] and see how it go i'm just [inaudible] since i'm [needing] lot of sleep 'cause can't breathe [inaudible] and even have [inaudible] headaches and can't think straight either but hopefully i'll get over it soon 
249,today was [inaudible] woke up feeling little bit better than had yesterday so that was good um and then finished some work stuff that was due and then [inaudible] on my paper that was due tomorrow although still have lot of progress [inaudible] just because i'm still [workshopping] few ideas need to fit into the paper but ultimately think it'll turn out all right um [inaudible] [inaudible] to go mostly i'm just concerned about how the moving is gonna go but do have lot of friends who should be able to help me and [inaudible] talking to my sister she might also be able to help me move depending on the dates and stuff it just frustrating 'cause it lot of work and it happening really quickly especially because move out and immediately start my new job um which is definitely gonna be pretty stressful i'm hoping everything go well because like i've pretty well prepared for it but we'll just have to see what happens in the end i'm just hoping that it'll ultimately be all right um other than that i'm just really ready for the summer to start 'cause have lot of plans with friends of mine and we're gonna hang out um as soon as finals is over as well if we have time so that'll be cool 
250,today was all right had to sleep in little bit and and then had to go to um club meeting which was okay just took longer than wanted it too especially [around the] stuff that had to go over um and went [inaudible] essay [inaudible] managed to finish on time and was probably the least um the worst one that [inaudible] last semester which sucks but that was mostly due to the length requirement so guess we'll just have to see how it go when get it back at least it done only have one more exam to worry about and that the one that i'm probably the least stressed about which is nice um and then once get that done i'll just focus on packing for my last two days before have to start my work at [redacted] which i'm really looking forward to although it definitely going to be lot but also it means i'll get paid lot so that fun and the only thing i'm really stressed about is [inaudible] what to do with my futon so might just sell it but we'll see 
251,today wasn't super productive study-wise did get lot of other stuff done and had meeting with my counselor this morning the last one of the semester of the year and she won't be coming back next year so i'll be getting someone new which is really interesting um and then had to meet with my math professor after that so guess that was [inaudible] but knew [inaudible] with them tomorrow and i'm studying for my exam before [inaudible] 'cause feel like that would be good use of time um and i'm honestly not too stressed about it think have pretty good grasp of this the material my teacher going to review few concepts and then in the afternoon spent the majority of my day packing and getting stuff ready to move preparing for my two summer jobs and stuff like that so feel like that was pretty good use of time as well um [inaudible] maybe should've been studying but will definitely focus on that tomorrow so it should be all right just really have to make sure to stay on top of everything in this last few day because start my jobs on friday and i've got really busy wednesday [inaudible] tomorrow and [inaudible] busy thursday i'm just really hoping that can sell my futon before then because otherwise i've no idea what i'm gonna do with it and don't want to donate it 'cause that waste of money so we'll see what happens 
252,today was pretty good [inaudible] little bit of [inaudible] night sleeping last night mainly because was still sick but still managed to wake up on time and do some studying before the exam that had today at 200 um which was my last one in this semester so it kinda crazy to [inaudible] freshman year to finish but on the bright side um i'll be starting my job on saturday um so i'm really looking forward to that 'cause i'm [inaudible] but also [inaudible] lot of fun and i'm still trying to [inaudible] figure out with the futons [inaudible] i'll [inaudible] get that ready for friday [inaudible] [set] i've talked to some friends about [inaudible] stuff [sorted out] [inaudible] so that i'll feel better um [inaudible] um i'm not sure what [inaudible] that have um [inaudible] still have to figure out housing stuff because haven't heard back from dorm crew or the summer proctor people yet but hopefully that'll get figured out soon 'cause it'll be nice to know i'm going to [inaudible] especially 'cause have quite few things to to take to multiple different locations since i'm staying to proctor the whole summer as well so i'm needing to know what gonna be happening 
253,today was fine i've been on kinda [inaudible] now that school over and i'm getting ready to move into my [jobs] but should all be all right and hopefully [i'll] just need to still figure out this thing with my futon and having little dilemma with the packing but nothing super major it just gonna be frustrating to move stuff multiple times because can't really lift thing um but uh should be all right in the end just have to stay on top of everything i'm little bit worried about my dorm crew job which had really not thought much of until now um so that tough because don't wanna be worried about it just wanted to [inaudible] [really well and] [inaudible] but know that probably not realistic just really hope that end up making captain um and other than that just don't know i'm not huge fan of saying goodbyes um [inaudible] 'cause i'm just not as emotional [inaudible] i'm ready [ready] for that to be over with 'cause know my roommate gonna be super emotional and i'm not really gonna have reaction but that just how am so but it'll it'll be done with soon enough so will have the room for few days which will be interesting [inaudible] 
254,today went pretty well woke up on time and um had to go and move all my stuff into storage and helped my friends do theirs which was fun and then my roommate left which is actually really nice um because she quite difficult to deal with but she did of course leave huge mess behind so spent the majority of the day um after finishing storage cleaning that up and then [inaudible] to do [inaudible] training to relax for little while um so tomorrow i've got to meet with my some of my working people um to get plan because i'm gonna be restarting work on saturday um [inaudible] go for the next five weeks which should be interesting but it know it gonna be difficult but i'm also still looking forward to it i'm only really worried about getting some stuff moved into temporary storage and because my sister yesterday said that she gonna come on sunday um to pick up my futon which is the last day that she can get it so that is pretty frustrating because she has to get here on time or we won't be able to get it so hopefully she do though we'll just see how that go 
255,today was pretty good got to sleep in for bit and then went to meet up with my fellow workers uh 'cause work starts tomorrow and we was talking about um stuff for my uh assignments that starts next week which was nice because we definitely needed to get that stuff so that we was all aware of the plan what we was doing stuff like that uh so it was really nice to go over that um and then we um after that came back to my room got [inaudible] and then helped friend move which was nice because we had never really got to spend lot of time together um in the [inaudible] so it fun to sort of just hang out with him alone and even if we was just moving stuff to someplace so really enjoyed doing that and then hung out with another friend for bit which is [inaudible] the other room and then there more people that um my friend is friend with but hadn't really talked to him once and so it was also cool to get to kind of know him little bit better and it seem really chill so think we'll hang out with him more um and then had meeting this evening got to feel even more motivation such as where i'll be moving next and who i'm gonna be working with starting monday um so it was really awesome because now i'm really looking forward to it and can't believe that work starts tomorrow and that pretty exciting and know probably stayed up little bit too late 'cause of nerves and stuff but think i'll still get enough sleep and i'll definitely try to get to bed early tomorrow um 'cause i've got work sunday and my sister coming down on sunday for bit at least which would be pretty cool so hopefully everything go okay 
256,today was good had my first day of work it kinda went well although it was really tiring and definitely didn't get enough sleep last night 'cause was waiting up for friend um and was trying to go to bed early tonight but have lot of packing to do rearranging so all of my stuff will actually fit um so i'm probably going to be exhausted tomorrow and am definitely not going to bed early tomorrow night either it sucks but it is what it is um and you know it won't end up being too bad so just [inaudible] and do my best am little bit worried 'cause need to wake up semi-early in the morning um so that can uh go over some stuff and move all of my crap into [inaudible] also on the upside if don't get everything moved can try and do it during my lunch break as well because don't have to be out of my dorm on time and my sister and her boyfriend will be here so it can most likely help me as well which will be nice also i'm not sure how much help they'll actually be 'cause they're really just coming to pick up my futon and then going um and that probably going to take quite while on [itself] so but i'm hoping it'll surely be okay and um so yeah am definitely worried but am looking forward to work tomorrow think it'll go well even though i'm stressed about it um and i'm sad to be [inaudible] on my first rental but got really nice new housing so although have ton of junk to move um it should still be really nice because it really nice housing [inaudible] again so that fine and maybe [inaudible] will help me move my stuff as well 
257,today was really good although extremely tiring had to wake up early and move all of my stuff into temporary storage and then went to work um it was whole lot of stairs so i'm [inaudible] really sore and was having to carry lot of stuff so i've got lot of bruises so it pretty painful but it also really satisfying work although was frustrated because the room i'm staying in was total mess so had to deal with that and um really didn't have time to clean it on top of everything else but that just what happened so um i'll just have to deal with it and looking forward to tomorrow 'cause i'll be meeting my crew and everything and really starting work so hopefully it'll go super well we-we'll see in the end um but think it'll be good i'm really excited so yeah 
258,today was pretty good it was my first day of work so got to meet my whole crew and made few mistakes but ultimately it ended up fine and got quite bit done i'm looking forward to tomorrow and i'm really glad that have the mentor and captain that have because he really on top of everything and helps me out lot i'm little bit worried 'cause my legs are really sore so walking tomorrow are gonna be challenge especially 'cause had to try and run back to the yard at one point and it hurt lot um i'm going to bed little earlier than did last night because i've got meeting at 700 are again [like will have] this whole week so i'm gonna try and actually get some sleep so can start feeling better and be really on top of it tomorrow um and make sure that my group get stuff done in timely manner so yeah that basically all that happening i'm kind of upset because someone [drugged] my mom and she just have not been available at all so i'll try and talk to her tomorrow instead guess 
259,today was all right had my second day of work and my crew fine um i'm just not very motivated still and ran into quite few problems especially with [inaudible] supplies and cleaning few things lot of stuff had to be redone which was frustrating um but think we're handling it pretty well and have plan for tomorrow hopefully if can wake up early enough i'm gonna pick them up donuts and stuff um other than that i'm just really hoping that my whole assignment gets finished by the deadline know i'm worried but do have one more worker showing up tomorrow so hopefully she'll be good as well and then we'll have four good people and two mediocre and two not great people um so yeah i'll definitely just have to see how it goes and it gonna be pretty rough 'cause i've got [inaudible] people tomorrow for competitive jobs next week but was really glad 'cause this evening got to talk to my mom and she gave me some advice and stuff and think i'll talk to my mentor tomorrow morning to gets his opinion on something um but yeah um other than that mean it work i'm doing it for reason because really wanna be part of this so hopefully everything will be finished correctly and on time 
260,today was pretty good and had work done but um got up early this morning to get my workers donuts and think that definitely motivated them and have some pretty great plans that we both set up for tomorrow so hopefully we'll get through all of them um and that really just matter of finishing up and everyone been saying that i've been in good shape and i'll even have another walk-through tomorrow night with someone that trust so that should go well because feel like she'll give me really good and honest feedback um and i've got assignment up the next week which i'm pretty excited about don't know we'll see how it go um and i've been trying to go to bed little bit earlier but end up [inaudible] for while because all my muscles are also sore but feel like all this really necessary thing to do um which are fine 'cause i'm still going to bed much earlier than did last night so think i'll still feel pretty good tomorrow when get up and maybe i'll even have enough time to grab coffee tomorrow um we'll just have to see 'cause did little bit of last prep as in basically getting my stuff together than normally do but think it'll still be just fine so overall let hope everything happening everything going okay and can't wait for saturday once i'm done with all the stress and can just relax and probably sleep in mean there small chance we'd get work but most likely we won't have to and that'll be nice um 'cause this week have definitely been exhausting 
261,today was okay i'm definitely feeling burnt out now that it um only been week that i've been working lot plus hit overtime yesterday so feel extra exhausted um but it good kind of tired in that know that i've been really productive and feel like i'm doing really good job so i'm nervous about tomorrow 'cause it the last day but i'm also really looking forward to it um my crew has really shaped up nicely um i'm kinda sad 'cause two of them will be separating but think it will still end up being just fine um because my assignment is going super well so far um am basically just has to get inspected which it should be done by my mentor so hopefully it will go really well um i'm not exactly certain but i'm pretty sure because he been checking up on stuff throughout the week so know it hasn't been too bad i'm gonna be sad not to see some of my crew members again after this but who know maybe will we'll just we'll has to see 
262,today went pretty well it was my last day with work for this week um with my crew and so it was pretty good but um it was super exhausting because worked for over 14 hours um which is definitely lot i'm glad that hit overtime because i'm getting paid really well but at the same time definitely need sleep um thought could sleep in tomorrow but then it turns out have an early morning meeting for work next week so won't be able to um but maybe can take nap later in the day or something also have to clean my room and help friend move stuff so still have lot going on but it should end up being fine um even though am getting to bed lot later than i'd hoped 
263,today was pretty good um didn't really get to sleep in like wanted because had meeting early in the morning but it was still fine because came home and was able to nap after that um and then helped friend move her stuff and ended up going to party that had been thinking about going to but wasn't sure if was in the mood but was only there for about 30 minutes and then left um with the intention of just eating and going to bed but i'm really not feeling well um so it been difficult to really go to bed um 'cause i'm having some issues feel really nauseous which is also not great because have work early tomorrow morning too um so i'm gonna have to get up early and um get ready and everything get [done on time] but hopefully it'll be okay and hopefully i'll feel better tomorrow i'm not sure what to do um but hopefully it'll just go away on it own 
264,today was pretty good started my [june] job um and woke up on time for it although was almost late because it was longer walk than initially thought but it still went all right um we spent all day basically loading unloading in science [inaudible] which was okay but it was kind of difficult um 'cause [inaudible] and did spend the last week [inaudible] um mm-hmm had to clean the whole house um but other than that when the alum started coming it was fun because just got to chill with them and take their luggage and i'm hoping that the whole week will still be fun um think that potentially i'll be doing this job for while um and they're and really like the people i'm doing it with so that awesome other than that my friend is moving in with me after friday so she had to bring much of them stuff into my room tonight which was fine but was also trying to get to bed so it little bit frustrating but overall still okay um think them living with me for bit will definitely be interesting 'cause will just have to see how it goes in the end 
265,today was pretty good had work again and woke up feeling rather tired but still managed to make it just on time and it was actually um the first [work] week here so that was pretty cool um then had good day [i helped] quite few people got to meet quite few people [inaudible] interesting and i'm glad 'cause think my boss really likes me um which make me happy because [inaudible] now that i'm doing good job she trusts me and appreciates my work so that pretty nice to know um other than that i've [inaudible] for the rest of the week and then next week start another job um but think this week will be nice at the rate it currently going um just because i've got um quite few things to do but relatively low key um so can definitely get that done um and not be too stressed about it although [do need to] [inaudible] because was so tired this morning and [inaudible] today [inaudible] um [inaudible] [to and meet] tomorrow but don't wanna be too late because that means i'd have to stay later which is fine but not ideal 'cause do have some other responsibilities that need to get done [inaudible] tonight um other than that had phone call from my sister who normally don't hear from which was interesting and had to give her some advice but think overall it went okay so that pretty good too 
266,today was all right overall uh um [did] wake up early in the morning kinda sick to my stomach which was frustrating because had to work um so went in little bit later 'cause already had approval from my supervisor anyway um which was nice because definitely needed the extra sleep after getting sick um and then when did go in felt better and we had relatively slow day so so got to spend some time relaxing which definitely helped um and then the evening got little bit busy but in fun way um [they're] really enjoy working with the people and that makes when you know you're helping um so that was nice and got to spend time with some uh [inaudible] my class and people that knew from my job last week so that was cool as well um because i'm trying to get closer to them so it obviously lot and we have lot of um activities and stuff in common other than that didn't really get chance to talk to my family too much today but still did little bit mostly with my mom which was nice because always enjoy hearing from them and how things are going it was also cool because um got my or know how much i'm gonna get on my paycheck and it like made lot but taxes that are taken out are definitely lot but it still gonna be plenty which definitely need because need to pay my credit card coming up in uh just little over week so i'm really glad to know that i'll definitely be able to do that as well as get few other things that i've been wanting so that super exciting um and hopefully i'll get to go out with friend soon think work tomorrow will be pretty easy thursday might be stressful and then i'm not sure how friday saturday and sunday will go so we'll have to see but hopefully have time to go um relax and do some things apart from work and definitely need to try and makes some time for laundry tomorrow so i'm going to go into work little bit later than normal but not too much so that can get off at semi-early time and do my laundry and everything so that should be nice 
267,we had work again today which was mostly all right although wasn't feeling well and had to deal with pretty frustrating person but it was understandable um because the person had just been having really difficult week although it was still frustrating [inaudible] [something] had to deal with it um especially because one of the other workers wasn't really doing anything so it could have been helping but overall i'm still feeling okay around the whole the thing especially 'cause know my manager really likes me and know that work hard i'm just sort of run down and tired and i've got an early shift tomorrow which i'm gonna try and make it to on time but also had to do laundry tonight and i'm just so exhausted that i'm probably gonna leave it in and grab it in the morning which means that i'll have to try and wake up slightly earlier so have time to go down and get it and everything um but that basically it and i'm looking forward to having break this weekend and may be going shopping 'cause need new phone case and an other stuff so that should be fun 
268,today was good day had work again but it went pretty well even though woke up feeling little bit sick um but almost done now and the only major frustration is that we had little bit of controversy over how we is gonna get paid and stuff like that but think it will work out fine in the end um although it might not be the exact outcome that we hoped for but something at least is being done um being fixed so that pretty good um other than that i'm pretty excited for my [job] next week and [inaudible] couple other people who [inaudible] is gonna be here so that pretty chilled as i'm good friends with them as well um and then we can become better friends as we all work together next week 'cause there gonna be very limited number of people who is actually staying here um so i'm really looking forward to that and i'm gonna have couple of people staying with me um starting tomorrow so moving them in is gonna cause little bit of difficulty but nothing too major um so it should be all right once it just finished um and i'm little sad that haven't seen my family 'cause [talked] [inaudible] today which makes me miss them even more but hopefully will get chance to at least go home for little bit sometime and see them depending on how much money makes over these last few week of work um and even if [just get] to see them for like five day think it will still be really cool because just haven't seen them in forever so we'll have to see how that turns out and hopefully it'll be good
