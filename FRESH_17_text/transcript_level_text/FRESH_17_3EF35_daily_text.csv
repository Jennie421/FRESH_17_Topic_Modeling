15,so it my second day with the wristband um feel like slept pretty well last night better than usual um like maybe like seven hours seven to seven and half hours it was pretty good um it was long day had lot of classes and that kinda stressed me out don't know i'm just falling behind in my classes and there things that need to be doing that i'm not doing um like 'cause i'm not sure how necessary they are so it just stressful and should probably do it but at this point it like too late for some of it but it like don't know i'm doing fine um and it just the beginning of the semester was in uh i'd say an okay mood today was kind of irritable i've been noticing like increasingly lately i've been quite irritable and um just like negative and really need to stop that because it like it hinders my um it just hinders me um and so i'm gonna try to be more positive in the future and like tomorrow 'cause i've just been in like shitty attitude and don't know why um and yes i'm just gonna study little bit more tonight had um didn't do much today other than go to class we just had like uh an orientation event um lot like mental health and stuff that we had to to for like two hours so did that and now i'm just gonna study like nothing that major um that it 
16,so had pretty good day today um it was unusually stressful at times um in the morning had last night had decided that wanted to switch one of my classes um and switch into another class it was very last minute um few weeks into the semester so it was stressful getting that all figured out and having to get the professor to approve that and now in the future have to catch up like in the next few days and so i'm stressed out about that having to catch up like for what i've missed in the last three weeks in that new class but also relieved because switched out of my first class for region for reason um and am relieved that i'm out of that but also stressed about making up what missed in my new class um uh also had kind of an exciting few hours today found out that i'd gotten to program that had comped for few days ago um that could ha had had an interview for few days ago and found out that was accepted to the program um and guess like they didn't accept many people and so was very excited to be one of the people that was accepted and um yeah very excited about that so that was cool um i'm looking forward to my meeting about that on um saturday and uh yeah i've been studying quite bit well not quite bit honestly i've been studying little bit and been procrastinating quite bit um social interactions were generally very good today had um quite few people um i'm worried that i'm not meeting enough new people and that just have like my group of friends that have now and that need to be working on forming new relationships with more people so that about it 
17,okay so slept okay last night probably for like um like about eight hours it it was it was good and woke up today and spent most of the day um or big chunk of it at least working cleaning bathrooms um on campus for my job so that was um that was big part of my day it kind of tiring um was doing it um think it uh in in in team guess or like in pair with someone else and we're cleaning the same bathrooms at the same time so was talking to him throughout it it was cool um studied lot today still stressed about catching up in one of my classes um but was was pretty productive was good at like coming up with plan and sticking to it i'm still studying little bit right now go to bed in like an hour or so an hour or two um wa wasn't very anxious today feel good and i'm looking forward to tomorrow um me and my roommates are gonna go do some things um in [redacted] we're going to go canoeing which would be fun um yeah pretty mellow day overall 
18,uh so slept pretty well last night got about seven hours um and woke up naturally and was going to go to work today um just like doing some inspections for my my on-campus job um and was gonna do that for like two hours but got really um just didn't wanna do it went after like an hour and stopped stopped that early was kind of anxious because the job involves like kind of pushing on people doors and bothering people and like uh don't know just didn't like it so was like anxious and like stressed out and just was just wanted to leave so did um and then went ca um canoeing with my roommates today and another guy and it was fun but um just had so much stuff to do like school-wise that couldn't enjoy it and it was was just very worried about like the whole don't know just felt like was coming off kind of weird all day because was so distracted or like my head was just in the wrong place or whatever so was worried about how like they were perceiving me today and whatever um then came back and studied for little bit um actually i've studied quite bit and i'm still studying right now am still trying to catch up on my classes it like have so much stuff to do um so i'm trying to do all that and it very stressful um had dinner with some friends that was fun the same group of people that usually have meals with um it was uh good day but stressful day and tomorrow is gonna be very very stressful so i'm not looking forward to it don't know how long how late i'm gonna stay up tonight but um ugh it yeah so have lot of work to do tonight and tomorrow so that about it 
19,so had um kind of stressful day today have class tomorrow that need to um get caught up in but it gotten to point where it impossible for me to complete all the work that need to complete by tomorrow and i'm still procrastinating um and it like there is just so much work to do i'm not doing any work which is very bad um plan of action but that what happening and i'm nervous about what gonna happen tomorrow so very very stressed about going to class tomorrow and ho i'm just gonna stay up for few more hours and read about um and read what need to read [inaudible] do do something and hope for the best um yeah so i'm not looking forward to that stressed out about that i've spent most of the day studying or good portion of it um other than that today wasn't too eventful had some meetings just for like clubs and stuff that i'm doing um which were fine little bit nervous for one of them but only very slightly and it was it was it was fine um got good night sleep uh no okay night sleep um yeah so i'm just very stressed about the class and i'm waiting you know very anxious for it to be over 
20,um so today was uh it was pretty good day not super um uh didn't really work very hard throughout the day um on anything but had was very nervous about my class in the morning had ton of homework to do for the class to make up for and didn't finish all of it in time and was worried that would it would be very obvious that wasn't able to do all of the work and that would fall behind and make bad first pre impression um but actually it went fine and was able to keep up with the conversation and contribute things and um it it really didn't need to do all the work to be able to to keep up in the class which was good so um that went that was fine um and after that had another class it went fine um and then um had to do like little writing prompt which procrastinated quite bit on um i've been think i'm getting little bit better and not procrastinating as school picks up but it still something that causes me lot of stress and still something that do lot of um i'm just very susceptible to like getting distracted by the internet and things like that um and then uh had dinner with like 12 people um because it my roommate birthday and so we went out to restaurant with him and and like said quite few people and that was fun met some new people um saw lot of people already knew it was fine it was cool it was very like low-key it was nice um and then got back and thought about studying little bit but decided to go to bed instead um so tomorrow have very busy day um classes and lot of studying so i'm little bit stressed out about that um yeah so that probably my major source of stress there some like social stuff that don't know i'm just uh [inaudible] i'm um hoping that i'm trying to just make sure that maintain all the friendships that i've created and that can be stressful um but uh it it good it good um and that about it 
21,so slept very well last night um think got like 10 hours of sleep little bit less like hours maybe um so slept very well um woke up at woke up pretty late um ate rel well relatively healthy today up until tonight when had lot of junk food um today was um was just kind of uh something had happened at lunch that just kind of threw me off and irritated me and pissed me off little bit and um just made me upset and so that kind of threw off my day little bit but um had dinner with friends which was cool and um so that kind of like lifted me up again and then um you know throughout the day studied little bit think i'm getting better at organization and planning ahead um and yeah so studied little bit for my classes wasn't too stressful today today went to switched into new class and today was the first day of lecture that was going to attend and um so went to the lecture hall and there was no one there and guess the location of the class had been changed without anyone telling me so that was stressful um and just kind of it was something didn't want to have to deal with and didn't expect to but it was all you know it was fine it was good day i'm gonna study little bit more and then go to sleep 
22,so had um good night rest last night and uh had uh um just you know went to classes that was fine um but had kind of realization today in one of my classes that don't want to be behind anymore and don't wanna like be in class where most people seem to know what they're talking about when haven't done the work which has be-been um kinda the boat that i've been in recently and think would be able to scoot by pretty well if didn't do all the work was supposed to do but decided that at least for the next week wanna do everything that i'm supposed to do read every word watch everything study as uh much as need to like do everything that the teacher wants me to do um and just do really get on top of things it important to start strong and need to get on top of lot of things so today went to the library today to study for really haven't gotten um haven't gotten to the library many times before here so it was for one of the first times and was very productive got lot done got just about all that needed to get done done which was great um worked on getting on top of things read an entire book it was um very productive so uh and uh as opposed to being in my dorm room which has been where i've been studying prior to today and that hasn't worked out very well and i've been distracted easily and procrastinate so think the trick is just to go to the library which is what i'll start doing um little stressed out today about some social stuff but we'll see how that all pans out um and that about it 
23,so slept okay last night um got like about seven or eight hours believe maybe bit more um but which thought was fine um and um had some classes today uh was little worried about some of them because had sections where was expected to participate quite bit and although was prepared was just worried about that won't be able to keep up or something so i'm little stressed about that and worried um uh other than that not much stress academically i've procrastinated little bit today but none of the work have to do is all that pressing um and kind of have problem where don't start work until the last possible minute and usually get things done um but even now that i've decided to be like more efficient and productive and to get done what need to get done find myself waiting until the last minute so need to stop that um and just kind of figure out way to so don't know just stop waiting till the last minute so that um what i'm worrying about today 
24,so spent five hours today working um in my on-campus job cleaning bathrooms um and did that with friend for most of the time so it was kind of social thing in addition to work which is nice and then um came back and worked for little bit i've been working pretty efficiently i've been definitely procrastinating quite bit less um and working on getting on top of things have just lot of stuff coming up which i'm stressed about um but uh i'm getting things together um have not well tomorrow have training for an extracurricular i'm doing which i'm kinda nervous about um even though know i'll do well but i'm just nervous about starting new thing so i'm stressed about that and then actually have to start the the new thing like officially um it like teaching program so i'm gonna start teaching on monday um which is stressful but kind of exciting and cool opportunity to continue something really enjoy so i'm looking forward to that also kind of anxious about it but uh hopefully it would go well i'm positive about it 
25,so just um quite stressed today because um just have so much work to do and it piling up and even though am doing pretty good job of keeping on top of things just have so much work to do and feel like uh have to put in twice as much time to be like half as productive as some of my classmates and like half as put together there people here that are just able to that are so much more efficient and think my academic background like my high school didn't prepare me as well as other people have for uh this school and um so it just stressful to feel like i'm always gonna be behind and that causing like stress and anxiety um which is what i'm worrying about now when i'm just working hard to to get on top of things uh um and it not gonna happen i'm not gonna ever be able to be on top of things and it just kind of really bad feeling um uh uh uh my time management has gotten better but still i'm just very stressed by academics and some special stuff but mostly academics that where the priority is that what i'm focusing on and that what i'm stressed about 
26,so had pretty productive uh pretty good day today um had quite bit of work to do um but was pretty good about getting it all done procrastinated little but do think i'm getting better um and um yeah so uh my my classes are are difficult but as i've kind of suspected the more time spend in them the the easier they are or not the easier but the more manageable they are and still have lot of catching up to do and lot of work to do and the work is never gonna subside but um i'm learning slightly slightly more about how to deal with all of it just so slightly uh but it good it in the right direction um and tomorrow have uh i'm gonna go in and teach some kids um about civics through one of the programs here um at the 8th-grade level and i'm feel little bit unprepared but i'm gonna have like an hour tomorrow i'm gonna go over the curriculum and um i'm excited but kind of nervous it all about perspective though so i'm just trying to be positive about it and it something want to do like i'm looking forward to it um and we'll see how it goes um and yeah that about it good day overall socially as well 
27,so had pretty eventful day today um started my teaching with local um uh middle school which is an extracurricular i'm doing here so went and for an hour today to their class and taught them some stuff was kind of stressed out before but when got there and afterward it was fine don't think it went very well like for several reasons but not really anything that was my fault or in my control um and it was fine um you know whatever so have kind of neutral thoughts on that and um you know after that studied for little bit procrastinated little but think i'm getting better um and had another little meeting for one of my extracurriculars um which was very low-key had um you know like said very jampacked day but it wasn't as stressful as thought it was going to be um it was it was fine overall slept well last night um and not much coming up um extracurricularly speaking but academics um are definitely piling up and i'm you know need to keep on top of it so that what i'm focusing on now or at least thinking about focusing on 
28,so had pretty good day today would say um semi semi stressful um at times but it was it was good overall um went to classes studied little bit i'm still having issues with procrastination but i've uh documented those struggles plenty of times before so basically the same thing um still procrastinate too much but feel i'm getting better getting on top of things um have noticed that if work isn't urgent as in it due the next day or the day of usually don't do it even though want to do it so it maybe something should change and um kind of excited right now 'cause just found out got um tickets to an event that really wanted to go to um so that cool and yeah excited about that looking forward to that event which is on thursday um with like yeah political figure so it should be cool to go to that um and yeah it was ex it uh exciting and it was good day would say 
29,so another pretty uneventful day today one thing i've been noticing is that um my diet is getting progressively worse which is big problem obviously well it not big problem not to be dramatic but like it problem so i'm going to try to like eat slightly less and healthy eat less sugar maybe don't wanna gain 15 pounds uh freshman year um and yeah had classes today i'm little anxious for some of them just like participating in class can always be nerve-racking but um that was it was fine um am don't know i've just been in was uh kind of irritable today um little bit like towards the end of the day um and just like bad personal like bad attitude um and i've been noticing that i've i've like lately i've just been wanting to be around other people less um it seems like and uh li um that that not good thing don't know i've just i've desired social interactions less 'cause it just like just wanna like don't know i'm getting sick of being here little bit it not big problem and i'm sure it just like my attitude tonight but just feel like i'm kinda sick of being here and i'm sick of being around the people i'm around especially um my roommates 'cause but they're the nicest people so know it it definitely me it not them like i'm the one with the have the problem ga um so shouldn't don't know i'm just getting kind of irritated by being around the same people all the time and just like even even the people in my classes it just like it getting so monotonous and repetitive and they just people just annoy me like don't wanna be around them and they and fixate on them and that causes me don't know don't know it just annoying to me and it like pisses me off and it shouldn't but pe some people just do and um like that think contributing to me having bad attitude and being kinda negative so need to fix that and just like ge-get them outa my mind um so um i'd slept horribly last not horri well not didn't didn't sleep horribly 'cause got enough got like seven hours but was so tired throughout today throughout the day like right from when woke up was exhausted and like could barely get through my first class without falling asleep and then like uh was yeah had to have had cup of coffee which helped little bit but had like lot of academic stuff to do today um and it was so hard to get through it 'cause was just so tired don't know why 'cause haven't been exhausted lately at all like since coming to college i've been pretty good but it just it all hit me today and uh don't know yeah i'm not sure 'cause did get enough sleep but don't so need to worry about sleeping more and like looking in my schedule making sure get eight hours and so i'll try to do that tonight 
30,so had pretty busy day today um but nothing like that unmanageable um slept good last night um got like got eight hours or so what needed to get um i've been feeling kind of sick lately but today felt fine which is good um and just went to some classes um not much to say about that it was kind of i've always got kind of nervous before section [inaudible] of my classes because um just feel like i'm not prepared and like everyone else is much more um knowledgeable and they know what they're talking about lot more than me and they just have background to the subject that don't have at all so they're like able to talk about things that just can't um and really shouldn't be able to like uh in terms of the context of the of the course it not things that we have learned it just prior knowledge that they know so that kind of stresses me out like don't know being automatically behind um and then went to um uh very prominent government figure who came to talk today um at the school and was lucky enough to be able to get into that get ticket to that um and so went to that and that was it was super interesting it was it was very um controversial and there was people protesting in the building um i've never been to anything like it it was just really cool and it um just like reminded me why made the right choice to come to this school um so that was really very interesting and something i'll think about for long time um it was just really cool it was kind of um just wild to be there there was so much happening um and came back to my room and just kind of you know didn't do much and i'll be going to bed since had long long day but um pretty good one 
31,so um had like pretty full day spent like three or four hours um working my on-campus job which is cleaning bathrooms um and did that with friend of mine um and always enjoy doing that just 'cause um it nice to talk to him and um it was it was good very low key um yeah always like doing that don't mind it really um and then went back to my room for while um okay just was on the computer for while and then had dinner with some people for um another extracurricular thing which is writing for the school newspaper um so had like meeting with people about that um and tomorrow have to go interview some people for story i'm writing um which is the first time i'll be doing that so don't know i'm not really nervous but it just like lot to think about and lot to plan and so guess i'm nervous about like the planning for it um but it should be good um and it was nice to to meet to meet other people i'm writing the story with that was cool and then came back to my dorm and um just like kind of went on the computer for while didn't do any homework today or any studying probably should have but should be good um i'll i'll do quite bit tomorrow um hopefully and uh that about it 
32,so had another pretty busy day today um slept well last night um today had to do some interviews for story i'm writing for the school newspaper um which was which was had three interviews and that was it was good it was my first time interviewing people so was kind of nervous but it was good experience and um there were good interactions um and th-then studied for little bit um but keep you know keep finding that am not able to really study until the very last minute on things and so like if it isn't last minute i'm have hard time concentrating so that something have to figure out um tomorrow have um have to finish writing in the paper th-the other story that i'm writing with some people which uh should be uh uh should be good um should be an interesting few hours and lot of work to do so i'm not looking forward to all of that um but that about it 
33,so had another pretty busy day today um um uh like worked just little bit more on wr-writing the article that i'm gonna that um was published today um but this it was published later in the night and uh worked on it early in the morning and like through the afternoon and so that was what spent most of my day on so worked little bit on that independently and then met up with group of people to go over my work and to see what they had done and and like talk about it and stuff like that and then later it got edited and published on the website um uh which is read by quite few people and it'll be published in print tomorrow which is exciting so happy about that um it cool that it all you know finally come together which is cool um and so i'm excited for the future and to write more articles about that and was able to meet lot of new people through the process which was cool and will be able to meet lot of new people um and uh yeah pretty good day procrastinated and didn't do much homework i'm actually behind at this point but i'll try to catch up uh eventually 
34,so today was kind of an exciting day because got my article my first article published in the school newspaper um so just seeing that come together was exciting and then went to teach um an 8th-grade class on civics which is what i'll be doing once week for one hour for the rest of the semester potentially the rest of the year um and was kind of stressed out before that because don't know i'm just having hard time connecting with them and they were totally not interested in listening so it kind of frustrating and i'm like yeah don't know never really know don't enjoy doing it but it'll be good for like future stuff suppose [inaudible] in the past i've really loved this type of stuff it what i've done in high school did ton of like teaching and like tutoring sort of stuff um so guess just have to get the hang of it and get back into the group and i'll i'll like rediscover my passion for it um and then had like another meeting for the school newspaper i'm getting stressed because like my extracurricular requirements are really piling up and like they're getting the time cons the they the time commitment is starting to conflict with like academics which is um concerning and something academics are of course more important than extracurriculars but find myself putting off academics for extracurricular requirements so have to figure that out um and then yeah so i'll we'll have to see about that 
35,so today got off to like not great start because uh slept through one of my lectures intentionally just [laughter] just skipped the class completely so that could sleep because was super tired but ended up getting good amount of sleep which was good um and need to just make sure start going to le to lectures 'cause missed one monday and i've been really good about going to them up until now um and was saying yesterday like my extracurricular requirements were starting to get in the way of school which is not good and just have to be careful not to put more on my plate feel pressured to like join million things and wanna join ton of stuff but just don't have the time right now so i'll just have to wait and focus on academics um uh was writing another story today and have to like go up to people and interview them just randomly um and don't know some of them were like very weird about not wanting to be interviewed and they so they were like rejecting the interview but get like so like upset by it 'cause felt like people were really rejecting wanting to talk to me it was like really it was kind of um don't know it was weird my reaction to it when people would be like oh no don't wanna talk about it um would get like sad and like feel like they were like just saying they didn't wanna talk to me 'cause they don't like me or whatever it was weird don't know and think about that lot and that kinda like put me in bad mood like sad mood for while which is weird to say but whatever and um uh studied or tried to get lot of work done we have super busy day tomorrow so i'm like not looking forward to that having to do more uh school stuff like ton of school stuff and then lot of this um news reporting stuff uh that gonna be long day and am looking forward to for it to be over need to get back on top of things that what i'm worried about um at this point 
36,so had pretty busy day today um had lunch with like an upperclassman that um uh she called like peer advising fellow she uh an uh lunch-breakfast so she like um an upperclassman meant to help freshmen which was cool it was nice to see her um and then um had class and spent another um pretty big chunk of my day trying to interview people for like another story i'm running for the school newspaper with someone else um and it was just so difficult to find someone and there was like lot of rejection so was rejected lot today and it don't know that helps build build thick skin um and then got story published uh that story eventually we managed to put it together um so that was exciting um tomorrow have busy day so i'm gonna try to get as much sleep as possible and um i'm worried i'm falling behind in in class and i'm not like need to start caring so 
37,so um last night like really didn't go as planned and well guess early this morning should say um clicked the button to indicate that was going to sleep um which planned on doing and then ended up seeing um like right before went to sleep ran to the bathroom and when turned on the light ended up seeing cockroach in my room and totally freaked out um went and slept like in in another area in our in our dorm room and spent all day today cleaning my room um like organizing everything like washing everything um throwing away every little bit of trash um hoping don't have to deal with that problem again it caused me ton of anxiety just uh yeah have like the biggest fear of of insects like that it just was like flipping out um and so didn't end up going to sleep last night until like maybe some time around uh 430 maybe um and got up about well about maybe four hours later three or four hours didn't get much sleep and um slept like on hard surface and it wasn't meant to be bed it was like sh it was uh very bad night um and so yeah spent all of today like basically just running around town finding different things that needed to like you know get my dorm together and it was felt like seeing that bug was wake-up call to like get things cleaner um around here and to organize and to like live more disciplined and live um in more disciplined way um it just creeps me out and it really kind of terrifies me just hate it hate there nothing more hate more than bugs like that um so that was really stressful and uh ordered some um stuff off the internet to kill them that'll get here hopefully um at some point tomorrow um but that was basically what did all day had section also for one of my classes which was like you know nothing really to say about that and then had dinner with my roommate and my friend which was nice but um was just exhausted all day long by the uh the the the lack of sleep last night so oh gosh we'll see what happens 
38,so um didn't do much today slept lot last night mean slept for like maybe like like nine hours nine or nine and half hours 'cause [inaudible] the night before last night had had really bad night sleep um and so just today didn't really didn't do too much didn't really do any homework or anything um studied um well no didn't study [or other] and just worked little bit on my on-campus job um and did that with partner and it always nice doing it with him always like don't know can't tell whether he like enjoys me guess uh my company or not and just feel feel like i'm kind of weird around him which don't like yeah do feel like i'm weird around him and don't know and then um came back from that at like 400 um had dinner with my roommate which was fine and um basically went on my computer for while not very productive day um but i'll have to get lot of work done tomorrow 
39,so had pretty um laid-back day today um woke up pretty late slept late but slept well which was good um had lunch with my friend uh one thing i'm worrying about is that have few very um had few have few good friends but i'm worried that my social group isn't large enough and need to meet norm new people and make more friends so that something i'm gonna really think about doing um i'm feeling kind of sick have think cold or something um and uh kind of was lazy today didn't do much worked for two hours um but other than that and then had dinner with the same friends um and so just wanna kinda branch out more um to meet new people and uh not very stressful day either 
40,so really uneventful day today i'm feeling little sick so like don't know it uh just something that happening took long walk which was nice i'm trying to be more fit um had lunch with my roommate and some friends which was nice and then just basically studied or you know was on the internet for the rest of the day didn't do too much um have to catch up with some of my classes um don't have any midterms which is good but i'm still worried about i'm glad don't have any midterms in the near future and i'm just worried about like testing and all that stuff and uh worrying more and more about like what my major is gonna be what wanna do so and then also worrying about like my friendships and uh you know should don't think have should have more friends than should uh like don't know yeah have the thought that most people here have more friends than me which sucks but guess that probably pretty common thought um so maybe i'll try to branch out little bit more

42,so had um four-day weekend which was nice but classes started up again today um uh actually i'm worrying lot about like getting everything done that need to get done it like mentoring time so i'm uh hoping i'm just making sure that get like all the requirements in for that and um kinda stressful um you know trying to keep on top of things um talked little bit yesterday about how like my friend group seems to be kind of falling apart need to make more friends so that something have to deal with but kind of just want like break from school at this point i'd really like to to go home for few days uh it not that i'm homesick it like i'm just kind of over this school for right now just wanna go somewhere else for like weekend and recharge um so yeah tomorrow have basically summer day i've been trying to eat more healthy and um exercise which is good i've lost like six pounds in three days just don't know don't really know why but why i've all of sudden like gone on like diet or whatever was wanna eat less just to see if can guess uh it kinda weird don't know 
43,so had another uneventful day today um slept for like an adequate amount of time last night but was extremely tired all day long so don't know why like one one and have low cold too so that might be part of it but like one of the most tired i've ever been so don't know what it is maybe don't know just don't know and um haven't been under all that much stress but do have some midterms coming up need to study for um socially today not much happened was kind of reclusive uh just like you know working on stuff and um had lecture today [inaudible] classes and then worked on an essay for while and um it just not very memorable day overall really you know not much else to say about it 
44,so not much to say about today slept very poorly last night but i'm up late today so don't know uh just during the day felt very tired but at night i'm fine so maybe i'm becoming no-nocturnal or something um i've been kind of eating less lately and exercising more but kind of stopped that today just eating unhealthy again decided i'd rather like be little bit unhealthy and eat food that is good and that i'm passionate about rather than like nasty like salad or whatever and like be healthy like know would just rather have good food you know what mean and so um there that and uh oh like met with some people for one of my extracurriculars today which was nice um he was nice guy yeah it was it was you know uh it was good day overall and just have lot of stuff to catch up on so i'm worried about that 
45,so today was very calm laidback day didn't have class today or anything um so woke up pretty late i've been really tired lately and so slept in quite bit um which is uh what it was good it was what needed um i've been feeling kind of under the weather lately kind of sick which is you know not great but um i'm still [inaudible] procrastinating but should be getting better hopefully um didn't really do much today just cleaned my room little bit and then um went to like meeting for one of my extracurriculars and then hung out with some friends for while um and then like just sat in my room basically talking with my roommate which is nice um yes [sorta] really not much to say about today it was good day and i'm happy and i'm yeah feel kind of uh very positive about this day and you know very overall just very happy [or] you know moderately happy guess 
47,so was like today was extremely tired again i've been i've been sleeping like for the normal i've been sleeping for like eight hours eight-plus hours lately like the other day probably slept like 10 hours on friday night um but i've just been so exhausted and don't know why like to the point where i'm almost like thinking need to go and see the doctor because i'm just so tired all the time like could take nap just could literally sleep all day long like i'm just so exhausted when i'm getting more than enough sleep so that big problem that need to figure out um and also i'm just like so stressed because have so much stuff to do academically and then also i'm like worried that my social life is kind of falling apart and i'm just extremely stressed and like [inaudible] just think wanna go home and like just take break from school for just like five days am suc so stressed have so much to do that i'm basically doing nothing can't concentrate just need to get my life together um and was extremely irritable today like towards the end of the day was just in the worst mood was thinking to myself like oh god you know hate this school i'm gonna drop out or whatever i'm gonna transfer was just in such bad mood and was able to like you know realize how ridiculous was being and like you know took some time to like write some stuff down about just like how was feeling and things that i'm i'm lucky to have and like wh reasons to be positive and so need to work on that but it was just the worst mood it was like such bad day it been really bad weekend actually um and i'm going to my classes with very little prep um which is not good thing obviously but you know don't know we'll see how how life goes 
48,so today was would say pretty good day um had class in the morning and then went to teach my kids not my kids but students in an 8th grade classroom in [redacted] which is what do once week and don't enjoy doing it and don't look forward to it but uh th my um partner for it is nice guy um and it it fine and you know it'll be good for you know just it good experience to have and it'll hopefully be good for my resume and and you know it it something to do don't enjoy it but whatever it not really that stressful um and what else did do oh had really cool event tonight at the institute of politics so was able to hear some really important people speak about world security and um international affairs and saw caroline kennedy actually in the audience which was really cool it was kind of cool altered bit um and then oh shouldn't sorry shouldn't say names um saw former first daughter in the audience which was cool um and then found out that with my 'cause also cover also do reporting with the school newspaper so i'm going to uh probably be able to interview really relatively famous actor through that kind of two-on-one with my other guy that i'm writing the article with so this should be cool um so yeah it good day and and have lot of studying to do which is stressful but it coming along 
49,so today it was good day um there were some things that happened that were kind of maybe not good but i'm positive um slept well went to class which was good um so some major like social things that happened um found out i'm gonna be don't know if talked about this yesterday but i'm gonna be interviewing like one-on-one or two-on-one uh pretty famous celebrity tomorrow um which i'm nervous about but also excited and kind of looking forward to it and it should be like an amazing experience or not well you know very memorable experience it something i'll think about regardless of how it goes so i'm i'm very intrigued by it and need to prepare but will be looking forward to it so that kind of cool and kind of found out more details about that today um and then also like met with some people on my dorm which was cool and then um just like kind of reconnected with an old friend today which is cool um but also found out that one of the people that had been friends with for while since coming here to college like was kind of not um not very nice person and was kind of saying some stuff about me and some of my other friends behind my back and just was like not cool um and so and then like she came up and and sat with us at the table we were sitting at like while we were talking about her which was weird um and so it was just kind of upsetting but don't know how feel about it yet um you know was nice to her when she came and sat down don't know how feel about it but it was just it was it was upsetting and was very worked up about it in the moment um so yeah that kind of sucks just like learning that someone talking about you behind your back but it was good day overall studied quite bit was fairly productive and i'm determined to uh do good sh overall so that about it 
50,so had very eventful good day today um went to class as usual i'm trying to think like didn't really do anything very notable earlier in the day um but was able to sorry i'm tired was able to um later in the day went to uh conversation that very famous celebrity was having at the university and afterward was able to interview him one-on-one in like private room in the back and it was just really cool um just to talk with him and got picture with him which is really cool and so was stressed about that but was more excited than anything and it was like super cool experience it i'm very happy today because of it yeah it was cool um so that was the most exciting thing that happened to me and then went back to the newspaper and brought the article and that all came good it came out good um and now i'm i'm back in my room and was studying for while i'm gonna go to bed so it was an eventful day and and good one 
51,so not much to talk about today um was in really bad mood and i'm just worrying lot about uh the midterms have coming up all the the tests the studying have to do too have huge papers and also i'm worried about like social things and like making enough friends and keeping the friends have and you know just typical stuff like that i'm really i'm extremely stressed out have like well don't know if i'm extremely stressed out but i'm very stressed out get like rash on my neck when am stressed um and that rash isn't has made its appearance so that sucks but um yeah it just not been good day i've been in really kind of hateful mood and don't know i'm just kind of in funk and hopefully tomorrow um i'll be productive and you know think was productive today but hopefully tomorrow i'll just have um you know better mindset and ready to be productive and you know problem-solving and just better outlook 
52,so um today spent the first few hours of my day cleaning for my on-campus job with friend um and that was it was cool um mean don't know if it cool but it was like it was fine like so that happened um and there really not much to say about that then studied for the rest of the day was pretty productive today think i'm learning how to kinda get in the groove go to the library and um i'm i'm learning how to be more productive and have midterm coming up monday that i'm quite stressed about but am just telling myself that if put in the hours will do better than if did not put in the hours so that my motivation i'm gonna i'm willing to commit over the next few days also i'm worried that my like social life is kind of lacking which is always kind of concern and it just makes me feel uncomfortable wish it was something didn't have to deal with so that also source of stress um and yeah so overall that was basically how my day went 
53,so think today was very productive day woke up telling myself that was going to spend most of the day in the library and that is what ended up happening so have midterm on monday that i'm stressed about but i'm really committing myself to studying for it and studied for um uh quite bit today nice amount today and tomorrow i'm really gonna buckle down and do hopefully ton of stuff so that what mostly on my mind um uh as far as social stuff goes today as far as social stuff goes um didn't really you know uh not much to say had lunch and dinner with my friend um you know i'm still kind of worried that i'm falling behind socially yeah so whatever and um yeah so tomorrow have to go deal with something which is kind of hassle like with my phone um i'll actually be getting new phone tomorrow but that shouldn't affect the survey so have to go deal with that like figure out way to get there so it gonna take two hours out of my day which i'm like kind of irritated about but 'cause need to study and then i'm gonna um yeah it should be fun should be cool no well not fun don't know why said that but like it should be productive hopefully 
55,so um uh today well the major thing that happened was that had midterm exam for one of my classes at 1000 um and was really stressed about what was stressed about it going in but think did good job of managing my anxieties um and think the exam went you know adequately didn't you know it it was it was just fine i'm not that wor-wo-worried about it really um and then had to go all the way into [redacted] to do one of my extracurricular cu programs and then the person told me as got there that didn't have to come today so it was like hassle to go all the way out there and then wait and then come all the way back uh that was kinda frustrating um and then had meeting for one of my extracurriculars which feel like i'm kinda falling behind and that that nervous nerve-wracking um socially really not much happened today studied quite bit um it was just kind of dealing with with other stuff 
56,so um today was i'm feeling pretty as go to bed tonight i'm feeling pretty happy and good um and yeah feel like it was successful day got lot of work done had dinner with my friends that haven't seen in while which was nice wrote an article for the school newspaper um and um what else did do yeah spent like the first half of the day going to classes and things like that um went to my lecture for one of the classes and that i'm in for the first time for like month so that was good it was like don't know just don't usually go to class for that class anymore except for section um so yeah there that and um yeah am feeling happy today and feel like it was it was good day and that about it 
57,so um slept okay last night and then went to few classes today um let me think what else did do um oh and then just studied for uh quite while um went to the library and just worked um have big paper due on sunday 10-page paper so kind of started thinking about that and i'll i'll write that over the next few days so i'm worrying about that socially uh not not much happened today was working for most of the day um and uh yeah so am you know and then at night just basically like chilled at right around midnight you know really didn't do much just sit on the computer so it was good day it was it was pretty mellow though um really not that much to to talk about but um yeah and not really any emotional things really else going on today 
58,so um today had another where wasn't very social just did lot of work have the big paper coming up that due sunday and so got um good chunk of that done and feel good about the amount of work did today did another short little essay for my my other class um feel like i'm on the right track and just have to keep up um so my parents came in this weekend for parent weekend haven't seen them yet but i'll see them tomorrow and i'm really not looking forward to seeing them um yeah just kind of stressful it like mixing of two worlds that don't really like um don't like the mixing it not that don't like them um and so i'm just stressed 'cause have like lot of stuff to do tomorrow in addition to like seeing them so it just like it become chore and have to uh like go to meeting and then go do some work like actual like paying like job and then have to like type more of this essay which is very long and tedious and requires just lot of energy um and then have to like read bunch of stuff and just have lot to do so it stressful but um oh and cleaned my room today so feel very accomplished with what i've done today so that about it my roommate kind of annoyed me but um nothing new there things are good it it good day 
59,so the big thing thing that happened today was my parents came for parent weekend um really was not eager to see them uh uh 'cause they stress me out in big way and had ton of stuff to do and still have ton of stuff to do but eventually like it was fine and had lunch with them and showed them around the campus so that was nice and was gonna get dinner with them and then like kind of figured out how to get an uber because it was like the guy was being an idiot and he wouldn't come to like the right area it was irritating so didn't end up getting dinner with them which was like put me in bad mood and then keep seeing mice and cockroaches that are really all over my room and it pissing it like absolutely disgusting and it unacceptable so it like so that big and then i've 10 pages worth of writing to do by uh sunday at midnight so it just lot of stuff to do and don't really know exactly what i'm writing about so i'm just stressed and i'm like it like kind of nuisance to have them here did enjoy seeing them but it like uh you know it i'm uh you know i'm just now realizing how like irritated i've been over the past day and i'm really not like didn't really see any friends today or anything like not many not much social things happening was just with my parents um and um yeah and it stresses me out 
60,so spent most of the day working on the sociology paper that have to write was very productive today quite productive would say um got like four or five pages done uh the quality of it is um you know debatable but um got it done which is what matters and then tomorrow have about like about two and half more pages to write um and then should be good so that basically what going on there um yeah so not too much to do there but just have lot of like editing to do and then saw my parents for dinner which is like nice but stressful and felt like was kind of in funk and don't know i'm just in different mood when i'm around them like in different gear when i'm around my family and they just they stress me out um and then just basically came back to my room and worked for while more and it like there lot of parties going on tonight um so was gonna like go out to one of those with um one of my friends but just have to work like th just have to get stuff done so didn't go out um and just like stayed in the in the basement and typed um which is what needed to do and then came back to my room and talked to my roommates for while which was nice we have like new couch that you can sit on and also like my don't know if talked about this yesterday but my room has like mice problem now that we've just developed which really sucks like in big way and um like it just stressful and don't want to have to deal with it like it creeps me out 
61,so um just i'm stressing lot today and like in the last few hours about blocking group stuff um and like who i'll be with next year um which doesn't don't have to worry well it doesn't happen formally until like february or march but i'm just worried don't i'm not really developing the friend group that would like to be developing and do have friends and lot of you know good relationships with people but just don't know maybe and and don't wanna have to force anything or really like work to cultivate friendships intentionally because that will just have probably the opposite effect of what want i'm probably just getting in my own head because do have quite few friends here but don't know i'm prob i'm know i'm worrying about things that everyone worries about or will worry about at some point um and then uh saw my family today which was good and they left back for where live and i'll see them again in like month um didn't really have i'm you know uh uh don't know wish they didn't uh hadn't come but whatever um but it was like fine when they got here and then um just worked lot on my paper again today finished my paper turned it in and so that was mean that was the bulk of the day um yeah and then had dinner with my friend so i'm just worrying lot about social stuff 
62,so um today um went to one of my classes at like at the section and then skipped the lecture from my other class just 'cause knew was like not gonna get much out of it and ho well actually the real rea well should've should've gone but in an ideal world would've gone but didn't go because was so tired was like slept well last night but then woke up and was completely exhausted like and all day long think it was 'cause took like an am cold or allergy pill last night that just like knocked me out and it stayed with me whatever so was just really tired all day long and then did like that teaching thing do once week which don't really enjoy doing but that like fine and whatever yeah so whatever and then um was just kind of down for the rest of the day and worrying lot about like what wanna do with my life what wanna concentrate in um like friend stuff is on my mind ton and blocking group stuff is on my mind ton and just feel like really haven't made as many friends here as had hoped to and the relationships aren't as strong as would've hoped they would've been as they would be so was not happy today and think lot of it is that my life is like disorganized and it was kind of mess today so just need to and also my self-esteem has been like it was really high for while and then like week ago it was just kind of it det-deteriorated so need to just like get my life together and start thinking positively and proactively and pragmatically and should be um on the up and up 
63,so this morning um went to class and then just studied for while and had to go interview someone for like two important people for an article i'm writing and really am like kind of dreading writing this article because have to talk to lot of people and like it just kind of awkward and um like talk to peo and just like set up interviews and like you know record people and it just it kind of uncomfortable and prefer articles where really it it doesn't really require that of me so i'm just like ugh mean ugh just really don't like it but gotta get through it because it like um you know just gotta get through it but it was nice conversation um and yeah gotta get through it so that can um and it it good club to be part of and enjoy it overall but and then um like late tonight had was just reading little bit and we had like little study break with my entryway which is nice then me and my roommate and someone on my entryway went to go see like little chris or halloween thing which was cool um and that was basically it um i'm still kind of worrying about social stuff but was and was down for most of the day but am pretty happy now 
64,so slept in today until like noon um and um just because was really tired and didn't want to go to lecture even though maybe should have but skipped lecture for one of my classes and then um went to one of my seminars to my only seminar to class for that um and uh today had to like interview someone or interview two people for an article was writing and always hate doing that when it like not super straightforward interview like when have to like figure out someone that willing to be interviewed and like ask around it just stressful don't like doing it um and so was like just and the guy was kind of terrible not terrible but just had kind of bad attitude and was like over that and then but talked to girl that was really nice so that was fine and and wrote the article i'm just glad it over that whole arti just didn't like writing it but like doing the um like writing for the paper just didn't like that article so i'm glad that it over now um and then dinner with my friends which is nice and um yeah i'm happy today 
65,so um uh not like much happened today really went to well had like lot of classes today thursday is like pretty busy day and they were all fine missed one of my lectures which like was hoping was like planning on going to but it just didn't work out it didn't work out because didn't want to and um and then um uh and then um had to like meet with bunch of people for like had to meet with my advisor and then went to um it was like over the business school well before that like went to like the to over to switch out the wristband for this study um and then like met with my like um my tf and had like section and so had to do that and it was like kind of stressful section is always kind of stressful and then um after that like what did do after that oh like basically just like studied felt like super motivated to like study so studied little bit and then um like worked on some some stuff that have to do for my classes and um basically not much else and like had like good covers good conversation with my roommates which is nice um yeah so i'm like happy it was it was good day um like not really much happened but it was it was fine and feel like super took um caffeine pill and i'm like super energized now and so think i'll probably have hard time falling asleep so it was like stupid move to do that um but whatever and classify it just like and classified the caffeine pill as um as drink of of caffeine uh like anecdotally so yeah that basically it okay bye don't know why said i'm like okay whatever 
66,so today really didn't have any like any classes at all so just studied for while slept in until like noon and then studied for while um and then went to like meeting for like an hour for one of my extracurriculars and then studied some more and then um went to my roommate had like little symphony like concert that went to and then came back and studied some more and um yeah so i'm going to bed now um so it was i'm just like really down lately like really depressed feel like social things are going really really horrible for me and i'm in my own head so have to just change my perspective 'cause things are not as bad as think but it also like kind of lack of of confidence think i'm just in rut kind of that all it is so need like break from from the school for while that would really be nice 
67,so really like didn't do much today slept in and then went to lunch with one of my friends and then um cleaned went to my job for like two hours uh which also did with one of my friends um which is cool and then basically just studied for the rest of the night and like went on my computer have like lot of work to do especially tomorrow so um was not very productive at all today but don't know did some stuff it was it was good day like really not that much happened um uh uh like had really difficult time remembering what did today when was like thinking about recording this don't know if that means anything but like for completely forgot which probably means that today was like not notable at all um so yeah and was like pretty mellow today i've been like sad recently but it was not as prevalent today guess 
68,so today just um studied for most of the day or like good chunk of the day um and then went to dinner with friend like slept in late so that why this is like half my day missing um because slept until like noon um but um yeah and then went to dinner with friend that hadn't seen in while so that was cool um and then got back was just kind of was on the computer for while studying little bit but mostly just like you know going on youtube and stuff um and th uh found out might be able to interview um like pretty famous guy that coming to [redacted] for the [redacted] so that kind of exciting just found that out few minutes ago um that like it could it could could potentially happen and it might not but it could um so that kind of cool um was definitely happier today than have been in previous days so that good um yeah

82,so like didn't really do much today um i'm at home so i'm just like relaxing um and wanted just woke up and basically like sat around all day and like went on the computer and like did some stuff around the house like drove around for while like nothing really that important um i'm just like i'm stressed about being home um like don't really enjoy being here but have and didn't do any schoolwork today so need to do that tomorrow so tomorrow i'm going to probably do quite bit of schoolwork and um have to and exercised little bit today and will exercise tomorrow um so yeah there you know it fine it good break from from college guess to be home these um for these few days so yeah 
83,so today um slept in um and um studied for well what did do woke up and exercised for little bit and then studied little bit and then watched tv for little bit and then uh my mom came home and we went driving for while then we went out to dinner and then came back and studied some more um and like um did some work so that was good was little bit productive today and need to to do some more tomorrow um but was like i've just been relaxing this these past couple of days and really haven't been thinking much haven't had like any like emotional issues or haven't really been too stressed about anything really um and i'm like part of me wants to go back to college and part of me is like really uh enjoying staying here so just trying to like balance relaxing and still doing school work over the next few days 
84,so today um slept in again and then got some work done for one of my classes which is good um did all the work needed to get done today today which is good so it was good feeling um mean procrastinated little but it wasn't an issue really um then exercised and um studied for little bit more and then went to see my family at like at my my uncle house like an hour away which is nice my extended family so that was exciting and enjoyed that um and then came home and studied some more and just like watched tv but um i'm like don't know i'm like kind of i'm thinking like my time here is only have few more days left and um i'll be going back to college which part of me is like like part of me misses it and also um like i'd would rather rather just stay here um so don't know and have lot of work to do tomorrow quite bit of work lot of work and just need to finish it so i'm like thinking about that as well which kind of detracts from coming home 
85,so today slept in again which has been nice and and then took my dog for walk um uh which was nice and then my grandpa came so talked with him for while and then took uh my other dogs well my grandpa dog and then my other dog on walk um which was nice again and saw my grandpa which was nice and um just did some work um so and originally my travel plans might change because originally was gonna go back saturday morning but now i'm thinking maybe sunday will be the day that travel back because had friend that died in april and like his mom just invited me to like his birthday like memorial thing which is happening saturday so like we're trying to figure out if should stay for that um which would like to do but we'll have to see um so i've been like stressed have lot of final papers to work on so i've definitely been stressed about figuring all of that out um have sociology yeah so that kind of stressful have paper in every one of my classes um so have sociology paper which is due sociology [inaudible] yeah so should be good but it just like stressful 
86,so today had um my family over for thanksgiving which was fun had like all my extended family so enjoyed that and i've been looking forward to that um and that was good and then did some homework still have lot of stuff to catch up on i'm going back to school saturday morning um so just have lot of stuff to do which is stressful and tried to get some stuff done today um yeah but it was it was nice having my family over and really haven't been all that stressed out lately and it been nice to be able to sleep in but at the same time i'm looking forward to being able to go back to um to college and finish out the semester and then i'll be able to like come back here for month or so um so it just like have lot of responsibilities lot of things to get done it just stressful to have to get them all done but have enjoyed my time at home but like said i'm definitely i'm ready to to uh to go back for sure 
87,okay so today i'll be going to bed um relatively early because have to get up at o'clock in the morning to um go to the airport and fly back to school which i'll be doing tomorrow um and i'm excited to go back basically um so i'm looking forward to it really and um don't think that um [inaudible] um got up pretty late today it was nice one last day to sleep in and then like kind of was irritable all day and like got in fight with some people and then just packed to come home basically didn't study at all although probably should've um i'm just like prepared to come back and it been nice break but like i'm very very ready to go back to school and i've lot of things to complete didn't do any homework tonight and really should've but just need to like go back to school and finish off the last few days or few weeks um until christmas break and then things will be lot better 
88,so had pretty um eventful day today uh got up at like o'clock in the morning 'cause had to get on flight um at 600 am to come back here to college and so ended up getting back here at like thr um like o'clock 800 am um and then settled in and took nap um for few hours 'cause was obviously really tired slept uh only little bit last night and then worked for like two hours and then came back to my dorm and basically just studied and um worked on paper have that due this wednesday um so have like ton ton ton of stuff coming up and just need to like focus on really getting getting it done and being conscientious about it um and th-that the main priority and also like haven't seen my friends in while so it like gonna be weird like getting back into the group socially so lot of stuff to think about 
89,so um well first of all wanna say that this survey just took an i'll them the people this um when talk next time but the survey just [took out] questions about how classes were going this last week and didn't go to any classes this last week 'cause was at home uh so just skipped those questions but other than that um today was like my first day like back in the groove of college um so had lunch with my friend and then another friend um mean uh like brunch kind of so two friends had brunch with um and ended up like keep for okay so this is girl that like [don't] really like and me and my one friend really like but the other friend there was like um friend that close friend is like dating and totally forgot about that and so started talking about this girl and then like he started like to backtrack in like what think was the most obvious way possible so it was like super awkward but was like oh my god um so the rest of the day was like thinking about that but hey whatever and then had like ton of stuff to do today for my um uh new like class newspaper extracurricular um so was like had to go to too like an hour-long meeting today for that where was just like sitting there and then another meeting um and then had to do like some reporting and like reaching out to people i'm dealing with 'cause i'm like working on two stories basically so had to do lot of that and had like uh have nine-page paper due um wednesday and just basically started today but got three papers done three pages done which is good um and tomorrow have to do my stupid um like teaching kids which really don't enjoy but it the last day doing it so i'll be like just focused on the bright side um so i'm gonna yeah so it was like whatever that whole thing at brunch was really weird just hate that um but whatever it was overall it was like productive day and just need to maintain this productivity until december 13th when everything is over for the semester 
90,so the day started out with um me going to one of my classes which was fine and then had the last week for the semester of this teacher thing i'm doing where talked about it in the past where like go around here at local school and teach eighth-grade kids about government i'm gonna really really really really hate doing that like just dread it every week and so this was the last week was doing it in that class so it was like big relief so it like happy day in that sense then i'm like finally done with that 'cause they were just not just they mean they were they were not good kids at all but one like we were saying our goodbyes like some of them like did like come up and like they like shook my hand and they're like really sweet and like uh were quite nice um and the uh so but don't know still it doesn't make it it doesn't like indemnify this semester i'm glad to be done with that and then just had like had to do like an article for the crimson so that was kinda new um very traumatic figuring all that stuff out and uh had like lot of work to do for that and it wasn't really coming together so that was kinda stressful and then had just ton ton ton of work to do for this essay i'm writing and it not coming together very well and have to wake up early it and do it tomorrow um so i'm really stressed about that and hopefully get that in and um well hopefully get that you know hopefully it it fine and i'm you know hopefully it it all works out 
91,so today was monly mainly voted devoted to um academics have paper due uh today basically 'cause it past midnight um and had lot of work to do on that and so was able to finish that up so spent most of the day working on that was very productive it was like really didn't have choice but to just get it done and the quality of the paper is um uh lower than would hope but it is done and it edited and i'm ready to turn it in so now just have to um get up tomorrow and turn that in um and then worked also had like sociology thing to do that was also kind of substantial and was able to like pull that out really quickly um which was good and i'm going to bed kind of late but [inaudible] [it] could be later and um so was very stressed about that but mean that was like basically the main concern had today and not much else happened i'm trying to think yeah mean really spent most of the day in the library or in my room just working on things 
92,so had just like really difficult day um in terms of like was just really really depressed and um just like really hard on myself and beating myself up about things um definitely probably one of the tougher days i've had at college just was really sad today like don't know feel like i've been kind of drifting apart just kind of falling out of line drifting apart from friends thought had and it just difficult and just really being hard on myself about most of these social things um and then didn't do any homework today because was just like so much in funk and was just uh it was difficult day and i'm you know don't know had lot of issues and like didn't go to the don't know just bad stuff and um i'm hoping that tomorrow will be better and i'm gonna try to make sure it is 
93,so today was definitely much better day than yesterday for whatever reason was just really down yesterday um and think something that i've realized is that well first of all like the perspective have on things and if make the choice to be positive and like think positive thoughts i'll have positive outcomes or i'll have like positive you know mindset um basically just like the day ha like the mindset have over the course of the day is very much up to me and also that um the social interactions have are like really are hugely determined of the type of day that have so if like see some friends then i'm like really uh very ha like generally quite happy um but if like you know don't get in touch with my friends for day i'll be like oh gosh like you know things are falling apart and um it not really quite as bad as think it is sometimes usually and i'm anxious and so it just something that struggle with but um didn't do any homework today i'll do it tomorrow so yeah it was it was good day 
94,so had i'd say pretty good day today it important that just keep staying positive and remember that you know there are some plenty of good things in my life for as many as there are bad things um uh cleaned for while worked for bit with my friends um with one of my friends and then uh the topic of like blocking groups came up and that something really don't wanna have to worry about but um kind of mentioned it like oh like you know basically the conversation turned to like oh um uh we would be good blocking group with like few of us and was like oh so it was like guess i've been worrying lot about lately so it good to know that other people are thinking about it and that like there potential that i'm like included in those thoughts but um don't know it just stressful and i'm not looking forward to the blocking season so that something i've been thinking about lot today and then have lot of homework to do and didn't really get to everything needed to get to today so just have to try to like stay on top of things and stay positive and just finish the semester strong 
95,so there really not much to talk about what happened today just did lot of studying um and worked have an big essay due and so uh worked uh quite bit on that um and so i'm gonna have like ton of stuff to do um over the next like two weeks so just have to stay on top of all that and um so today was like little bit stress at the beginning because wasn't really sure what was gonna write about and then ended up like kind of figuring out nice thesis and planning things out so that was just matter of doing my research and writing the essay um and really didn't ha like socially nothing really happened today was just working in the library it reading period so the the focus is really on um on the academics and just you know like said helping uh finish strong and um looking forward to going home in about two weeks but there quite bit that needs to happen before then 
97,so had quite busy day today slept really not so good last night um and woke up well slept for think it was like three or four hours last night and had to wake up at like 830 to go to class that had from 900 to 1000 and then from 1000 to noon slept so that was nice to get nice nap in and then the rest of the day have big paper due several big papers due so was working on those and um just had few meetings to go to um so it was pretty good day was happy today i've been very stressed lately and so it you know um just really important that learn how to manage my stress and um everything like that um so yeah that basically and you know i'm staying up late but have lot of stuff to do so that basically it 
98,so today was pretty busy day um woke up and then spent like an hour or so in bed typing because have big paper due several big papers due and then went from that to like meeting for my for like club so had to spend like an hour and half at that um and then came back to my room and eventually went to dinner at my academic advisor house with two with my um with like few other students that he advises and like felt was like stressed while was there and was like don't really know them and really don't like them like that something noticed like was stressed and was like oh my god i'm so like felt like was being like anxious or whatever and then realized like and normally would like totally be myself self over that but realized that like don't really like these people and don't care like don't want to be like them or like to like fit their standards or whatever so it was that was kind of like freeing moment to be like oh actually don't care and that something that usually don't think about unless it was interesting to put in that perspective and then came back and and studied for while so it been productive day and i'm happy today and think it uh really important lesson learned that like i'm very happy being the person am and you know although may kind of wanna like impr like don't know i'm happy being the person am and should be little bit less critical of myself then try my best in everything so 
99,so um not much to talk about today slept in and then had to go to another meeting for club that i'm part of and then worked for little bit and then had to go to anothe-another meeting and then worked some more and then came back to my room and i'm now going to bed so have still ton of work to do and it stressful and have studying to do on top of the work and i'm just worried won't be able to to finish everything in time but um yeah just have to to really try to work hard tomorrow there mean the just have lot of things to do and so i'm very stressed and that is really taking precedent in my mind um was uh pretty happy today not much to say um to guess kinda feel kind of lonely but i'm not really that bothered by it um yeah so pretty good day overall just very stressed about academic things in particular 
100,so today woke up pretty late again need to start waking up earlier and um went and had lunch with some of my friends and then went to the library and worked for while um and then came back to my room and eventually had dinner with another just few of my friends um and then went to the library again and worked for while after that um had lot of stuff to do today which was stressful um academically but got most of it done um well got bit of it done eventually uh uh went out again to get some food with my roommates which was nice and then um came back and worked little bit more and finished up one of my papers and just have ton of stuff to do these next few days are gonna be super rough but um need to you know every minute counts and don't really have minute to spare so have to really try to wake up earlier tomorrow 
101,so today um just spent lot of time working on my homework and the things need to study for um that was the majority of the day um woke up pretty late i've been going to sleep late and waking up way too early mean way too late um so that should probably be fixed and had to just be spend lot of time typing and then this after like this night there was like school-wide like event in the the yard like that was fun to like go and watch and so that was cool but um other than that really not much happened today um it was pretty good day and wasn't wasn't really upset or irritated by anything all that much it was you know productive day and just need to make sure that i'm that uh continue to stay productive tomorrow it really uh just lot of work to do 
102,so today was pretty similar to yesterday um just had ton of stuff to do so worked quite bit um and still have lot of work to do tomorrow an enormous amount an overwhelming amount and it like my the writing have to do is taking precedent over the studying have to do and the really need to start studying and i'm just worried won't have time won't have enough time for everything um so this coming week is going to be uh god extremely stressful and have lot of stuff to do and it gonna suck but just need to like keep breathing power through do what can um you know and realize that all can do is my best and i'm usually pretty good at well i'm usually extremely good with handling like academic type of stress and just knowing that like i'm doing my best and whatever happens it i'm just doing my best um and then also like had little meeting with um for one of my extracurriculars which was like fine and then um what else did do had dinner with uh some of my friends one of whom haven't seen in while so that was nice and um then came back and talked to my my roommates for while so it was good day but just have lot of things to do i'm stressing about like blocking groups yeah guess uh maybe i'm just stressing about blocking groups because um have like one group of friends and i've thought hopefully i'll block with them and it kind of been brought up and now now like don't know don't know if it'll if it'll come through eventually and one of my friends says he wants to block alone potentially which is like ugh like weird and feel like all my eggs are in that basket and wish was little bit more social for that reason but other than that i'm really kind of fine and then my roommates brought up the idea of blocking together today which was like okay so i'll have you know few options hopefully um so we'll have to see it very stressful 
103,so once again pretty typical day just spent quite bit of time working um woke up later than should have i'm gonna try to hopefully wake up uh little bit earlier tomorrow um and just had lot to do and i'm not studying as much as need to be i'm just like writing um so have an exam wednesday that haven't studied for at all um but don't think it'll you know take too much time to study for it and um yeah it was good day had dinner with my friend came back to the dorm and there was like cat then cat like came in our room for while so that was like exciting guess and like literally very little happened today like have nothing to talk about was like stressed but like don't know woke up in kind of bad mood and then because little bit more positive and yeah so not much to talk about and probably having similar day tomorrow but maybe little bit more uh productive 
104,so had really difficult day today um just uh have lot of stuff to do and feels like won't be able to get it all done and it like the most overwhelmed i've ever been in my life probably and am being very dramatic right now um i'm just in that kind of mood i'm in the type of mood where wanna feel bad for myself um fuck this honestly have so much stuff to do and it overwhelming and uh so by today it tu so it tuesday morning and by friday have to write 15 pages of paper that do not even know what i'm writing about yet and have done none of the research and need to do an enormous amount of research for it so i've got four days to do that and then complete uh two final exams one of which have not studied for at all so i'm basically completely fucked and it not like i've just been sitting around doing nothing i've been working on other papers it like just don't have free minute just don't for the past two weeks like it not like i'm slacking off at all every second spend working and um ah maybe i'll be able to i'll have to get the paper done and hope will have time to study but i'm just hate this feeling and i'm ready for the week to be over i'm ready for saturday to come and be able to be done with this am angry and like under an enormous amount of stress and just fucking hate it and uh that it and i'm need to just find it in me to persevere and do what can and then get to that friday at 1159 pm and then just be like i've done what can 'cause don't wanna just shut down and have breakdown like already am kind of having 
105,so today was just extremely stressed out again because have so much stuff to do um and just was trying to get it all done and it was was overwhelmed really is the best word i've never really been overwhelmed academically as much as have these past few days have lot of stuff to do and when think about it it is overwhelming um so tried to get uh made the choice just to try to get one thing done uh did little bit of that have midterm tomorrow that really haven't studied for mean final tomorrow that really haven't studied for um so that gonna uh uh you know that gonna happen and i'm gonna do my best and think do know quite bit and it kind of something i'm i'm gonna be able to kind of bs little bit um yeah but i'm just gonna try my hardest and then need to write quite bit tomorrow and um yeah so when think it like i'm kind of in the final stretch and get that midterm done tomorrow mean that final done tomorrow no matter hows i'm gonna try my best i'm gonna wake up little bit early and study and then i'm going to uh get done with that i'll be out of that by 500 pm i'll be done with my hopefully my take-home final by like 800 and then i'll be writing quite bit tomorrow but when i'm done with that take-home final will feel like i'm in the final stretch i'll be able to take deep breath for minute and then do have 15 pages to write um over the next three days in something that i'm not totally well versed in but i'll be able to get that done and i'll have nothing but time for that over the next on um thursday and friday so after when get that exam done tomorrow and try my best on it two exams um one take-home exam will uh be able to breathe so it exciting that i'll be very close i'm close to the end of that and it stressful but uh i'm gonna wake up early tomorrow and study little bit try my hardest on that exam come back to my dorm do the rest of that exam do the rest of my take-home exam submit that and um take dep breath and begin my final assignment um so just about trying my hardest and breathing and thinking clearly at this point and getting some sleep so that what i'm gonna do now 
106,so today um most of or good chunk of my day was spent taking final exam had three-hour final exam which was like you know an exercise in endurance but it was like six essay questions in three hours and it was just really draining and think did like fine really didn't study all that much and you know did as best as could just like said would yesterday and so that all can do really so that happened got my final paper back for that course too which did well on um and what else um after that exam had dinner with friend and then went to the library and finished another exam had so right now i'm done with three of my four classes which is good but still have have pages done of 15-page paper that due friday so have my work cut out for me um and the pages i've done so far are not very good and the tf is very harsh grader so and i'm flying home tomorrow and like i'm not like haven't had chance to really pack or like get excited about it or like think about it at all and part of me just wishes had postponed it or whatever so tomorrow i'm dealing with that and i'll be at the airport and um uh getting hopefully quite lot done so that it

116,so today um woke up pretty late and then just worked on some things and my grandpa came over so talked to him for while and then went over to my family house that lives nearby for while um and then left and didn't do much jogged for while um went on short little bike ride like not really that much happened and um just like said before i'm just so um my kind of hatred for my uh dad is just really extreme and just don't like being here uh looking forward to going to going back to college can't wait honestly um so yeah 
117,so today was christmas and spent most of the day um at my uncle house with my entire extended family doing that um slept really horribly last night got only got probably like four hours of sleep um and so was pretty tired throughout the day and um then [inaudible] bad mood and didn't really didn't enjoy myself but it was nice to see my cousins always like seeing them um and yeah i'm just kind of hating myself lately and i'm trying to get out of that funk don't like being at home it like toxic environment so i'm looking forward to leaving it like can't come quick enough still have like uh like four weeks almost um which is not cool uh yeah and so just trying to pull things together and [inaudible] 
118,so today um was christmas so didn't have lot of like obligations um so most of like the christmas like festivities happe in my family happen um on christmas eve so today was just like pretty chill day slept in lot and then like saw my grandpa and then just just got um money 'cause that all wanted so got some checks that was cool and then exercised little bit like really not much happened it was nice relaxing day though and always just continue like having conflicts with my family and just and it kinda sucks that like things just don't work out but they don't and i'm not really you know that basica that just that and um yeah so i'm trying to like trying to get more in shape and figure out what classes wanna do um next semester so that kinda what i'm focusing on and yeah that about it looking forward to what gonna happen next 
119,so um once again not that much happened today my grandpa left town today so just said goodbye to him um and then cleaned up my room little bit later in the day exercised um and yeah just kinda did few few other random things read little bit so yeah not much to speak of really today i'm still trying to to figure out what courses wanna take next semester and um all that stuff but things are going well yeah things things should be good yeah so that is basically it it was good day today i'm feeling good about everything 
120,so um not much happened today one thing i'm worried about is that one of my classes like the grades were due today for all classes and for some reason the grades are not out now so i'm like what is like why and know didn't do very well on the course so it like what going on with that um yeah and then i'm i'm not uh so like my sleep schedule like way off uh i'm just hoping that get that figured out and i'm trying to exercise little bit more so did that today and that good and was driving little bit 'cause still don't know how to drive so was like practicing that um and yeah i'm feeling little bit it just kinda weird have like headache after running so and drank water after so don't know why but um yeah we'll have to see 
122,so yeah um my sleep schedule gotten to the point where i'm going to bed at like 500 and getting up at like 300 or 400-ish um and really feel fine about it like prefer being up at night have nothing to do during the day typically because like i'm on break and i'm like very much embracing the idea of break and just not not doing anything not fulfilling any responsibilities feel great about it um so yeah like once again not much happened today um am glad to be away from school for another day but like wanna go back guess kind of but i'm like enjoying break uh enjoying having nothing to do and like zero responsibilities it great um [ever been] like at home with so little to do because when was at high school obviously had like million things to do and ton of commitments and so yeah this is great but um got back grade for one of my classes today and did well and was super like uh the final paper turned in was complete garbage it was so bad and wrote it in like three days and it was 15 pages and so was like god i'll be lucky if get in this class and ended up getting an minus and so was like fine i'll take it like very happy with that um and yeah so that about it 
123,so now want just to really talk about today once again um i've been working out lately and didn't do it today 'cause it'd make more sense to start tomorrow like for new year or whatever or today yeah tomorrow actually um so yeah i've just spent the day at home not really doing much go to sleep at like o'clock and get up at like 400 which like feel really good about like sleeping as much want like this is like the best month of my entire life just like doing nothing love it it so great i've never had so little to do feel so good about it and then um know i'm gonna like go back to school and be really busy but it nice just to have this month to like do nothing and like sleep as much as want and like just said sit on my phone all day um and it really nice so yeah that basically it 
125,so today woke up earlier than usually do uh you know usually have enough break and just practiced still don't have my driver license so was practicing with that for while and i'm uh gonna hopefully take my test soon and do as well as can on that then came home and ate lot of unhealthy food and watched movie with my family and then exercised little bit which was good guess but um don't know i'm really been hating myself lately for like physical things which you know is not not good but that just been what i'm thinking about lot lately and was already stressed about like going back to school and how things are gonna work there like socially and academically so like just stressed but you know uh very typical 
126,so not much to talk about today um scheduled an appointment for friday morning to take my driver test so that should be exciting and hopefully i'll pass that i'm little bit nervous about that um because it so last-minute wasn't planning to take it so early but looking forward to that and i'm gonna practice over the next two days and hopefully will pass that um don't know i've don't know i've kinda been [eating] i've just been like don't know self-confidence has been like not good lately and yeah um but [inaudible] is fine honestly go back and forth i'm doing pretty good and um yeah just looking forward to going back to school [inaudible] stuff like that 
127,so today was pretty good day not much to talk about um and so um just kind of just finished exercising little bit um so that was good um and then throughout the day i'd ride little bit um practice driving my driver test is friday morning so i'm little bit nervous about that but i'm feeling little bit confident and i'm just gonna try my best and hope that everything goes well and uh yeah so that basically uh my day um thinking one more about what classes wanna take when get back to school and um just kind of get little bit stressed out every time think about it like the social stuff and the academic stuff you know is kind of stressful but it'll it'll all be good and i'll approach it you know with positive attitude hopefully and and just like to make myself feel stressed out when there really not much to stress out about things are going pretty well 
128,so um basically have my driver test tomorrow so i'm trying to get to sleep early and um that at o'clock in the morning and so i'm little bit nervous about that but just hope that get enough sleep to be awake enough for it and hopefully do well but i'm just gonna try my best and if failed wouldn't be all that devastated i'm just gonna try my best and see what happens um and so today just did some practicing for that little bit and then read little book [inaudible] which was good i've been watching on tv and then wrote something um yeah so an okay day having some mood swings lately but it like very um very typical so not really surprising and um yeah just trying to thinking lot about what gonna happen at at the test tomorrow 
129,so today was kind of uh nervous and woke up earlier than usually do um for my driver uh like driver license exam which passed so that was good and was happy about that and then went to the um dmv afterward to get my license and that all went well and i'm just glad that it all finally over and i'll have my license don't really need to drive anywhere anytime soon but it just something don't need to worry about anymore which is good and um yeah just really irritated with my family and ready to go back to school so yeah and still like thinking lot about what classes wanna take having lot of issues deciding on that so yeah it don't know it it tricky figuring out what wanna do but whatever 
130,so today um didn't sleep too well and then woke up and went to go see some of my family members so spent the day with them um we went to like little arcade which was fun for my younger cousins and then um uh like we went to ikea so like not don't know we just wanted to see them and so we did that that was nice and always like being with them and um then what did do came home and just exercised for while which was good um i'm don't know i've just been really kind of like hating myself lot lately and don't know why but my it like my mind is just try like really like don't know it weird but um i'm just not in the best mood and i'm anxious to get back to school 
131,so really not much to talk about today i've i'm trying to like i'm not like overweight now or anything but i'm trying to like get in shape um so i'm gonna like hopefully lose like 10 pounds or whatever and then start like um gaining muscle so i'm gonna try to do that and um so that should be good and so i'm just like on diet right now where try to just eat very little and exercise lot like wanna hopefully lose 10 pounds in like two weeks and then when get back to campus i'll be able to go to the gym regularly so ate like very little today i'm like pretty um one thing will say is have pretty good willpower so i'm hopefully gonna be able to keep up with that um and yeah didn't really see many people today didn't do much family kind of irritated me as usual i'm getting into kind of conflict with them and i'm really like said just hating myself lately which don't think usually do when i'm on campus so looking forward to going back to campus 
133,so not really that much happening in today uh drove on my own for the first time which was uh exciting guess so that was something and just went up to like store and like not too far away for me but that was good to just be able to drive alone for the first time and uh and um read little bit today and i'm starting to was trying to like eat little bit healthier so that still happening and going pretty well yeah not much to talk about today um my neighbors are moving so went over and said goodbye to them and um talked with my friend for while which was nice hadn't seen him for bit and uh it was good day not really that much happened as usual um lately i'm uh enjoying not being as busy 
134,so not much to talk about again today um exercised and then uh drove little bit because have my license so that good thing now driver license so can drive on my own i'm still not feeling very confident about that but it good and i'll be home for about another 10 days then i'm just um i'm probably gonna be going traveling little bit tomorrow we'll have to see i'm not really sure yet um traveling up up north little bit so that might be good [inaudible] yeah need to get my hair cut tomorrow just lot of stuff to do before go back to school in about 10 days tomorrow yeah so still have bit of time but not much and have to start just getting things together for the spring semester have to figure out like what classes wanna take and what activities wanna do 
135,so um today thought i'd be traveling little bit today but that not uh didn't uh end up doing that i'll be doing it tomorrow maybe uh potentially but um so today just kinda drove the car around to like run errands for the first time um 'cause just got my license so did like um went and got gas and then went to the atm and went and got my hair cut so that was good to like just feel kinda like independent obviously at college i've been like very independent but guess [to do it in] car is um good step forward and just feeling felt like really inadequate today and like kinda depressed um but um then started to pick up and i'm just don't know hopefully just kinda get like this sometimes but hopefully going back to school soon will help change that and make things bit better just gotta be positive 
136,so today was another pretty straightforward day had originally planned on going up uh going on little like trip up north but one of my family members was sick so we ended up not doing that which i'm fine with wasn't too upset um so um was just spent the day at home the roads were very icy and it had just snowed so wasn't able to drive anywhere so i'm i'm just getting to point where i'm so ready to go back to school just because i'm really sick of my family and like do nothing all day but just like watch tv and then go on the computer and like like snapchat people and just mindless like stuff and um like there i'm just not doing anything anymore and i'm i'm ready to leave my family and to um go back to school and jump back into things so yeah 
137,so didn't really do much today either um i'm trying to think yeah it was the roads were pretty bad um so wasn't able to go driving so just stayed in and exercised um little bit which was good got into that little bit and um tried to you know have week left so when go back to school i'm gonna hopefully be more um like healthy and go to the gym more so um i'm like preparing for that so that the concern now and um getting little bit stressed about going back but don't know have week left so i'm not quite sure how feel about it at the moment but you know i'm always stressed about something always anxious about something which is guess bit frustrating 
138,so um today just was thinking on about the classes wanna take next semester and was kinda stressed about that and i'm gonna take one course that counts for two courses so i'm debating as whether or not wanna take three courses altogether um which would is the equivalent four courses with that double course i'm taking or um four courses so that something i'm thinking lot about and i'm also kinda stressed more and more about housing day and like getting back into the groove of things but think everything will be good and just have to go into with like positive attitude and um so hopefully everything will be good there and yeah about week left until go back and um yeah so just enjoying my final days at home and hopefully i'll i've been working out little bit which is good as well 
139,so once again not much to talk about um today am applying for freshman seminar course to take next semester only did one application and put like not much time into it at all so probably won't end up getting into it but don't know just did it 'cause might as well have something to do and if do get [it] probably won't even take it and so the i'm just spending lot of time thinking about what courses wanna take and um worrying about getting all the requirements that need to get in um so that what i'm thinking about lot and i'm stressed about going back to school little bit but looking forward to it just kinda ready to go back but at this point um haven't been doing much lately and it been nice for while but it gonna be good to go back and kind of have responsibilities again and to um get back into the groove of things and yeah continue doing all that stuff 
140,so as usual not much to talk about again today um am still sp-spending lot of time thinking about what type of courses wanna take um saw uh friend of mine that haven't seen in while today um who um neighbor actually as well and um was moving away so spent some time with him and just said goodbye and that was like fine and then um have read little bit uh exercised today which is good and i'm just excited to go back to school and thinking lot about whether wanna take the equivalent of four cla of uh yeah four classes or five classes so 16 credits versus 20 um i'm not quite sure what i'm gonna end up doing but thinking lot about it and um yeah 
141,so not much to talk about today um i've been trying to exercise more lately and just kinda got sick of it today and tried to do it but it didn't end up happening so like that was don't know just have to try to get back into that um and um yeah i'm thinking lot about classes wanna take talked um talked for bit to friend of mine from from college who obviously like it was just over um over facebook which was nice just like except for like been talking with um people from well not haven't really been talking that much with the people from school as um over break and so it was jut nice to guess touch like touch in um but i've been kind of enjoying the distance from college even though it been what i've been thinking about lot so yeah few more days and then um i'll be back 
142,so um didn't sleep too well last night but that was fine and um like i've said if an i've been stressed lately about figuring out what my classes are gonna be next semester um and applied to seminar that didn't think i'd get into and only applied to one seminar like uh the freshmen seminars you have like many options and just applied to one thinking wouldn't get in and then ended up actually getting into it which is good guess but it think wou it was um just like lot of contemplating whether or not wanted to take it and um do think so i've just done lot of [inaudible] today whether wanted to take another seminar um in addition to the uh 16 credits that i'll already be taking um so yes it was just something had to think about but think um you know it all hopefully gonna come together nicely 
143,um so today was pretty good day was able to get some chores done around the house i'm leaving um i've leaving soon to go back to college so um just am trying to get them some things done and uh met friend of mine that haven't seen in months at um at restaurant and saw her for while which was nice then came home and and did some more things so i'm just in the process of packing and and i'm getting ready to going back to school which is stressful because have lot of stuff to do and um yeah just kind of stressful but it hopefully will all come together and you know it will and um and just very soon i'll be back in the swing of things and and figuring out what want to do for the semester and uh things like that so i'm looking forward to just kind of getting back in the groove 
144,so today was very busy day um in that was uh packing all day 'cause i'm flying back tomorrow um well guess today now and it was just really busy like last-minute stuff um to make sure that i'd gotten everything that needed to get done done on time and all that stuff and so just stressed not that got like everything packed 'cause packed in like three hours and was like 'cause it was the past three hours i've just been packing so just don't know didn't get to it for while um and uh so was stressed about that but i'm excited to go back um going on the plane tomorrow and then getting back with the groove of things being back on campus and just kind of starting the second semester uh um yeah so i'm just always kind of neurotic about packing and hoping get everything and right now i'm thinking about things that might have forgotten so i'm gonna try to go to bed soon but yeah just have lot of lot of stuff to think about 
145,so i'm back um at uh on campus after winter break um uh flew back today woke up pretty early and flew back and back on campus so that good and was nervous coming back was very stressed to come back but when got here saw my roommate and that was nice and went to meeting which already had to go to which was annoying and then uh saw some of my friends which was good yeah so good first day back um it gonna be good semester it gonna be great semester i'm looking forward to the [shopping] classes and figuring out what wanna take um and it that gonna start tomorrow so looking forward to that and um yeah just little stressed about housing day was brought up um brought up by someone today to me um [inaudible] just the like the politics of blocking can be stressful but i'm hoping it goes smoothly and uh was talking to my roommate about it which was good and then think have couple other friends [inaudible] but we'll have to see so you know whatever had you know it doesn't really matter that much to me but still we'll just see 
146,so um today was pretty good day uh it was the first day of the semester so was shopping few classes um and things went pretty well there was um quite nervous today for some of my classes um took language course um and so the first day of that was bit intense and i'm just thinking lot about whether or not wanna take that course um for the semester and then had dinner with some of my friends that haven't seen um in like five weeks since before break um so that was nice and then my roommate came back and we uh kind of switched our rooms around and talked for while which was good and that was about it i'm just it was good day but i'm pretty stressed about um figuring out what classes have to take and and social stuff and and everything like that so um lot to figure out but i'm gonna try to just keep you know keep shopping classes tomorrow and and see what like and see how it all goes 
147,um so today was there was lot going on today actually like um well woke up and went to some classes then um shopping and i'm considering taking [inaudible] course and bought the textbook for it and just returned the textbook and now i'm thinking oh maybe should go back and get the textbook and take the course again don't really know i'm i'm just contemplating 'cause um it very nerve racking but like the idea of don't know just have to think about it so maybe i'll go tomorrow or maybe won't and um then was just kinda depressed for some of the day for reasons can't really understand just felt very my mind felt very disorganized and chaotic um and you know didn't go out with didn't go to dinner with any friends just like stayed in and don't know was kinda depressed today and then friend texted me about whether he wanted to whether wanted to block with him and few of my other friends which is what kinda had been hoping would happen and said yes so that might be happening i'm not really sure there but that kinda got me excited um because of course blocking is something stressful so just to kinda be uh done with it or have an idea of what gonna end up happening would be good and uh yeah class schedule still stressing me out but and i'm gonna try to go exercising uh tomorrow morning so i'm going to sleep early um so that about it 
149,so um yeah today was don't know uh kind of an interesting day um uh um uh sorry about the background noise but i'm i'm i'm away from them uh went to class today this morning wasn't totally sure what courses wanted to take um but think i've kind of settled into that and and german is still um but it it an an intensive course so that kinda stressful and then um met with my academic adviser and that was nice meeting and then went to course with my friend and had dinner with him then after dinner it was just like don't know tend to kind of hate myself after like one-on-one social interactions and it don't know that can be kind of awkward don't know yeah just like beat myself up over it and it been something that like happening increasingly which don't really understand uh because talk with plenty of people have plenty of friends but that something i've kind of been noticing uh more and more frequently um i'm just kinda making up things in my head so that kinda shitty but whatever 
150,so today um woke up as usual at you know 700 uh late late 700 early 800 don't quite remember um to go to my o'clock course which have every day of the week and went to that course and i'm always kind of it language course it german so there lot of like on the spot like you're called on you have to know stuff and how to say things and i'm not quite good at stuff like that um so that stressful and i'm always kinda embarrassed and know it not super justified but just 'cause it it who cares but yeah so have to study lot for that and then came back to my room and just kinda feeling like not even depressed but just like wanted like you know i'm transitioning back to college from being at home for five weeks and it was like just wanted like day to like kinda be alone and so just like spent the day like in my room um good part of the day in my room uh like watching tv and like um like going on the internet and just kinda like relaxing like talking to my friends back in [redacted] like on the phone and just doing things that like um that kinda made me happy and we're not like connecting with lot of people here um at school where am now um so that was that was good and then was just like yeah really wasn't depressed wasn't sad but just like needed that time alone and so that was good to kinda recharge and um do nothing for while and then ended up going to dinner with one of my friends and then we saw another friend and then it turned into kind of bigger thing where we um there this little bonfire outside so we talked for like like probably like three hours or two hours maybe um by the bonfire then played ping pong and then just like walked around bit and we talked little biout about blocking gro-groups um so it was like it was mores more than expected and saw lot of people um so that was good to kinda like don't know after being kinda couped up inside it was like it good to to do that so yeah it was kind of big day in in the sense that kinda went from being in hall around nobody to being with few people so yeah that about it 
151,so um the past day like this day really did um just stayed in my room almost the entire day and studied for my german course it an extremely like i'm starting to realize how intensive of course it is and how much how demanding it is and so basically just kinda studied all day today in what was what was necessary to to even keep up and even now have lot more work to do so it you know stressful but knew i'd just stay in today and that was fine and so just did that and studied all day and then procrastinated bit which is frustrating kind of had like breakdown like oh can't do it can't handle it and then took deep breath and just really like kind of committed to studying for few hours um and made some good progress and i'm feeling bit more positive about things now but it just gonna be difficult semester and i'm trying to take extra additional extracurriculars um on top of that and it like can't even handle the extracurriculars was already doing with this academic load and um so i'm just kinda frustrated about that frustrated about the implications that my academics and extracurriculars have for the future things like that and wasn't worried about anything outside of academics today that was kinda the focus today didn't really talk to any of my friends didn't uh guess left the room like once or twice like ugh was just studying and um yeah so that that and how i'll probably be doing some other thing tomorrow so uh yeah i'm we'll see how things go 
152,so once again spent good por-portion of my day um studying for german and then studied bit for some of my other courses um and then oh had meeting for one of my extracurriculars and so that like added pressure something just really need to work on um and then um had dinner with some of my friends and one of whom hadn't seen in while so it was cool to catch up with him and then came back to my room and studied little bit more um like said i'm just gonna have to to study lot for this german course in addition to the three other courses that i'm taking so it gonna be busy semester but think can handle it and made some progress this weekend and um it just about studying and and being confident and those are two things need to work on and should be able to grow lot from from the course and it it not like anything i've taken before but just gotta like said be confident and study and um hopefully can handle it know can 
153,so um not much to talk about today woke up at like the normal time like o'clock about and then um uh went to my german course which is an hour long um and that it went well i'm getting like more confident with it which is good but it still like lot of work and then um what did do came back to my room for bit and then had another course and then another course and um my third course have with my friend [redacted] so like we went uh together and it just guess good to have course um with friend and then have like so that like two hours and then oh had to interview someone for an article was writing and then wrote the article um and it was just lot to do but it was fine and then studied little bit more and uh had dinner with some of my friends who haven't seen in while which is nice and uh yeah it was busy day but it all went well 
154,so have quiz tomorrow in my german class so spent most of today studying for that i'm bit nervous about it but i'm hoping it it all goes well and um yeah so that tomorrow morning and um yeah i'm feeling okay about it and so spent just most of the day studying for that and um didn't really see anyone do anything socially really think about anything but the quiz um and had uh german in the morning and then had my expository writing course um and that was good it was my first day of that course and the teacher seems nice and the conversation was like interesting so um i'm looking forward to to being part of that course and um yeah so just focusing lot on that quiz tomorrow and hoping for the best i'm gonna try to study little bit more tonight and then and then go to bed and um you know hope everything goes well so that about it 
155,so um today was overall pretty good day think i'm getting little bit sick um so that guess not great but should just be little bit of cold um had german test this morning and was very nervous about it but it seemed like everyone was nervous about it and don't think did too good um which is guess disappointing but uh sounded like no one else was really confident how they did so we'll just um kind of have to see how it goes and then ran into one of my friends at lunch two of my friends actually one of whom hadn't seen in while so it was nice to talk with him um and then just basically spent the rest of the day in my room and like said feel like i'm getting little bit sick so trying to just relax and studied bit um but not much to say pretty good day got some applications done for some extracurriculars want to do this semester so um not totally unproductive day either 
156,so um today was another busy day had my early class that have to go to um five days week at 900 am so had that um and it been good guess to get up early um and i'm worrying that i'm not gonna be able to keep up with it but just have to keep keep committing to studying and and things like that um and then came back to my room for bit had another class that went well and then eventually had to go and had um an article wrote um for the school newspaper that took like an hour and then had another class um and then what did do just came back to my room and um studied for bit and then had nice conversation with my roommates and uh yeah that about it it was um you know an okay day not much to discuss 
157,uh so today was pretty good day um had class in the morning for two hours and then went to get lunch and um then went then worked for while have have job cleaning things on campus and so did that with my friend for like two hours which was nice to talk to him for while um and then uh studied more for while and um went back to my room and uh and had dinner with one of my friends and um both of my roommates have their girlfriends over tonight so it kind of awkward just being in the room so i'm i'm sleeping like in the common [inaudible] area and don't know it just kind of irritating but it fine and uh oh and worked little bit more um just on homework and stuff and uh yeah so was good day 
158,so today um woke up pretty early and worked for bit and then had meeting and then worked bit more at um at my on-campus job and studied for while and ate meals with my friends and uh told to stay away from my room 'cause both my roommates had their girlfriends over um which which is guess kind of annoying just because have to sleep on the couch but it fine don't mind it too much um yeah so don't know i'm just really tired and thinking lot about what have to do in the morning and it just gonna be busy semester and i'm wondering if should drop one of my courses or just take it pass or fail so that something i'm thinking lot about too and uh yeah so we'll have to see 
159,uh so today was pretty pretty good day overall um slept in the bed which is good i've been staying up or i'm kind of getting up pretty early lately so it nice to sleep in this morning and was sleeping on the couch in our room because uh both my roommates had their girlfriends over um or actually no one of my roommates' girlfriend left but um the one that i'm rooming with in the bedroom had his girlfriend over so had to sleep on the couch for two days which was which was fine uh didn't mind it all too much but stayed out of the room for most of the day just so that you know they could have their space so that was guess you know whatever mean it was fine it was fine and um just studied lot today had an issue with kind of procrastinating and and not not getting everything done that needed to get done in the in the time period but ended up getting quite bit done and and so that good and um had meeting today for one of my extracurriculars which was fine and uh one thing i'm kind of stressed about is that tomorrow i'm starting new program where volunteer with kids in like an inner-city area that live in like government housing and um figured out the names of the kids that i'll be working with today and one of my friends who did it last semester told me that they're like are just not not good kids and that they're probably gonna give me lot of trouble so that concerning me and i'm ugh don't know because wanted to do three things this semester so think what might do is um go tomorrow try to be as positive about it as possible and and hope that they're good um and i'm and i'm sure i'll be able to kind of work with them and i'm sure it'll go fine but if it doesn't have to debate uh trying to find something else um so that uh stressful thing to have to worry about but i'm i'm gonna try to just make sure that that it all goes well 
160,so today was very active day probably one of the busiest days had i've had um all year got up early as usual for my german course and then had to run and prepare for meeting had with my teacher from one of my courses that completely forgot about and then had another course for an hour and then had um uh an an hour off where had lunch with some friends and then had another course for two hours and then immediately from that went to volunteer program for my first time and actually really enjoyed that but it was just lot of work and then after that came back and had dinner and uh went and just spent the last like four hours at my at another extracurricular doing like night editing shift for the paper so it was stressful day and i'm super tired and kind of worried about how i'm gonna be able to function tomorrow but i'm gonna go to bed 
161,so um hi sorry just had to walk into private location but um just let me think what did today um didn't sleep too much last night got into my dorm pretty late and then had to wake up and go to my german course which kind of embarrassed myself at and then had [inaudible] writing course which um really enjoy so that was nice and then um had an interview for an program that might be part of over the summer and that was kind of stressful and don't know don't really know how felt about how did but was stressed out about it bit but think managed the stress quite well um and then studied for bit at the library had dinner with um few of my friends which was nice um blocking things seem to be settling out maybe which which is good hope there no last-minute drama and uh it was good day 
162,so um woke up at like 750 today and went to my german ca class which have every day and that went well was like debating not going just because yesterday kind of embarrassed myself and wanted to study more um but went to that today and it went well and then had another course which was just was super tired today because only slept for like six hours for the past two nights um and so actually yeah yeah so need to get to bed but um so that course was like kind of don't know was zoned out and didn't do thing and still haven't done any of the readings in that course so that kind of stressful then blah blah blah studied and then um uh had dinner with uh two of my friends and my roommate who haven't seen in while um and uh and it was good day yeah was kind of stressed as usual um this german course is big commitment but it was good day aft overall and i'm feeling very positive 
163,so um today was pretty good day i'm very stressed out right now because we just saw mouse in our room after seeing many mice in our room and thinking the problem was deal was dealt with so um that horrible and i'm just stressed about it and pissed off at my uh roommates kind of and um but it it just as much my fault honestly so i'm just being weird and um so uh it was busy day and procrastinated lot when shouldn't have um um [contrived] like brilliant study for my german test tomorrow then have another busy day tomorrow so just have lot of of stuff to do and it constant i'm considering dropping one of my courses and it something i'll have to consider little bit more before monday and um [inaudible] just had busy day with lot of stuff academic and uh extracurricular and social and it was busy and things were good but this is bad way to end the day and i'm so just pissed like whatever 
164,so today was another pretty busy day had class for two hours in the morning german class and um it was had quiz and that went okay not great maybe even not okay but i'm moving on with my life and then had section and it was for my political science course and realized in that course how little liked political science how little liked social science in general and it was just kind of like an awakening moment like oh my god should not be studying what thought was gonna be studying and then it was like should do premed because like the idea of being doctor know i'd be good doctor and like interacting with people when i'm in position of authority so was like maybe i'll be premed so looked into that and um will not be gov concentrator will not be sociology concentrator or uh an economics or social science concentrator in general social studies either uh so that that was big development for the day it was just like like just realized that the course like fucking hate when i'm learning so that was interesting and uh and then so i'll probably do humanities or uh premed maybe uh but think do still probably i'm going to enjoy law school just don't like don't like uh oh shit is it that don't like science and then probably shouldn't be premed don't know i've still gotta figure some stuff out don't like social science so we'll have to see 
165,so today was just busy day really uh every day of the week is really busy day um including weekends this semester and that which is gonna be tough to managing things and don't know that can manage everything i've decided that i'm probably gonna drop one of my courses which should make things tiny bit more manageable which is good just have to spend tomorrow writing about four pages and then have to uh have to go to meeting and write an article and do german homework and learn german and really should be reading from my government course so tomorrow gonna be hellish day i'm just gonna try to get up early and um power through and today also is very stressful had to uh worked and typed for while and i'm just stressed out about my writing course and about what wanna do for the summer and then what wanna do with my life so it just it tough but i'll figure it all out 
166,so today was just very hectic day for couple of reasons um had lot of writing to do and had very little amount of time to do it so that was stressful figuring out how to fit all that in um and then uh had to do something for an extracurricular i'm gonna be missing class tomorrow just so can get some extra sleep um and need it and i've earned it and uh uh it shouldn't be any major uh big deal so and um was just don't know today it was just completely academic day didn't think think about anything social had lot of homework to do and it was stressful but got through it kind of and um yeah dropped one of my courses just because realized it was gonna be too much work um so uh it was kind of big decision to make but feel like it was definitely the right decision and now i'll have little bit less on my plate and have lot to do tomorrow and just am gonna always have lot to do guess 
167,um so today just can just um slept in and missed my 900 am course because have was just up late last night so felt like it was best if went to bed mean if if slept in bit which was nice and then also missed one of my extracurriculars today just because had to study and so felt fine about that wasn't too worried about missing that and um and then just studied lot uh had few meals with my friends which were nice and uh i'm trying to think yeah not much happened today um starting to dropped on of my courses so my academics this semester should be bit more manageable and have to um go tomorrow and kind of organize my third extracurricular which hasn't yet begun um but just um i'm just focusing on kind of managing my academics at this point 
168,so today went to my german course and it went okay still have lot of studying to do um and uh and it just difficult to catch up um but that went well and then had uh my [inaudible] my uh writing course which was nice course and uh met someone who kind of had few things in common with which was cool and then um studied for bit and um met with uh co-teacher of mine for that i'll be teaching civics with next or like tomorrow we begin um so that was interesting and then um yeah and then had like study break tonight where we talked about blocking groups which was pretty straightforward not much to say about that um it was yeah it was nice nice day still just am very busy and have lot of stuff to do always which can be stressful 
169,so today was pretty busy day um had my german course in the morning as usual and that went well and was feeling confident but wasn't able to study as much as would have liked to today and just need to spend some time thinking about how important it is to study more and then had civ um uh had to started new semester of doing the teaching program do in new school with new person um so that was cool and it was tricky to figure out how to get there but it was he seems like nice guy and it was nice class and um that went well and it should be good semester um on that front and then um uh studied bit had dinner with some of my friends blocking drama is still present and um kind of stressful and i'm just really tired and um like said just need to focus on studying more and hopefully blocking stuff is figured out because it seems like it just stressful situation for for everyone 
170,so um today was pretty pretty good day wasn't able to study as much as had originally intended um but went to my german course and then went to my writing course and then went back to my room and studied for while and um eventually had another course uh film screening which was good and then went to dinner with some of my friends and then came back and studied some more um one thing that kind of irritated me was that don't know just feel like come off as bit dumb um kind of intentionally and don't mind that and feel like was just being kind of don't know don't like that but also um just feel like was being kind of judged by some people for some of my interests by like my friends tonight and just kinda pretentious and un and unnecessary feel like um but yeah don't know it was overall uh pretty good day 
171,um so today was pretty good day um had my german course in the morning and that went well and feel pretty good about about that course and then um studied for bit and um went to dinner with few of my friends and then my friend did like comedy show like 930 so that was good and then um don't know went back to my room it wasn't very eventful day and was kind of not very interested in um being around people yeah for good part of the day just like wanted to be alone which is good and that important to be that kind of way every every couple of days um 
172,so um was able to sleep in bit today which was good um and yeah so slept in studied for bit um had lunch it was pretty good day overall um was fairly proactive studying studied more today than was usually able to do and then don't know i'm still little bit stressed about blocking i'm worried that things are gonna fall apart 'cause that seems like something that might happen and i'm [gonna] you know knock on wood but um really hope that things just go well um and kind of had breakthrough moment today just few minutes ago when was thinking about my german course and how sometimes don't study as much as need to because know that can still get by on the course and do well on the exams without studying all that much um but just kind of at this moment [once] like i'm in the course to learn german um not not just to get good grade and so if commit to learning as much german as can that good grade will come and that kind of think the key so that was good moment 
174,so um have german test tomorrow uh uh and that something that i've been studying lot for today and i'm just still would like to study bit more for that so that something might stress me out bit but th think i've learned that you know i've just gotta try my best and then mo-move on with my life and i'm working towards trying my best um and had uh don't know there was not much of um was mostly studying had meeting for one of my extracurriculars that was like fine not much went on there then um yeah just studied and had dinner with my friends and um yeah it was fine day not much to to say really my sleep schedule feel like i'm not tired at all um already tried to go to sleep so that kind of weird but other than that things are good things are yeah going well 
175,so um today ended up being not super busy day but quite stressful day um had german class in the morning and took quiz in that class and uh it didn't go well so that was kind of frustrating but hopefully i'll do better in the future and just need to study more to ensure that do better and then had uh meeting with one of my teachers about one of my essays and she basically told me that like all of it was wrong so have to rewrite it which sucks um and i'm ve was just really frustrated with that for while and think it just gonna take bit of time for me to figure out where to go from there um and was just very frustrated with her and like the whole class um and was just irritable today and didn't really wanna be around uh mu many people and don't know not much to discuss today but i'm gonna try to go to sleep and hopefully tomorrow will be productive day 
176,so feel like was marginally more productive academically today than am most days i've just been very lazy lately and just kind of focusing on like instant gratification and entertainment as opposed to studying and that like just obviously huge problem that need to mediate and i'm gonna work on that um and so that just like my number one concern at the moment and then um uh kind of good thing about the day was that figured out my essay topic and that like worked good that worked well um and still have to write write it and figure some things out and then wasn't able to study as much german as wanted to because was just slacking off lot so it just huge huge problem procrastination that need to stop and it just sign of immense weakness yeah and need to stop it everything is gonna happen tomorrow in my head and like tomorrow never comes so i'm just gonna try my best tomorrow have to write bit for my paper write about 650 words which shouldn't be too bad um and then study bit and so should be good day 
177,so um today worked lot on my paper and was kind of stressed about having to write that but it seems to be coming together okay and so that good um and also was little bit stressed about blocking today and just but had some good conversations with my but with my hopefully my blocking group and so that seems to be hopefully panning out well um and that will open up um on monday the official blocking uh situation so looking forward to just kind of getting through that um have lot of work to do over the next two days lot of work but i've have had to do more in the past and it always turned out okay so know that i'm capable of doing this now it just matter of doing it and procrastination is still big issue that i'm i'm worrying lot about i'm stressed out lot about but hopefully i'll be able to manage everything and just keep things um under control 
178,so um uh spent the first two hours of my day in german course and that been going pretty rough lately and um i've just been having difficulty um staying up today in that course and my teacher kind of pointed it out so that was low point and then studied for bit worked on my paper for bit and then worked for th about three hours on my on-campus job with my friend and then had dinner with him afterwards so that was nice and then came back to my room and worked bit more it was good day was little bit irritated by and then like just disappointed from the from the german interaction that mentioned earlier um and so so i'm just very stressed this weekend as well because have lot of stuff to write and lot of studying to do on top of that so it been kind of difficult day and it gonna be an difficult next couple of days and i'm sort of just worried about [blocking] stuff as the date approaches but hopefully um hopefully everything gonna go [on] when work hard 
179,so um today was pretty busy day where had quite bit to do um started the day by going to my friend--my roommate and one of my friends uh were in comedy but not comedy but like dance show type of thing so went to that to support them which was cool um saw that and that went well um and then just have an enormous amount of homework to do and so i'm gonna end up having to write five pages tomorrow which is very stressful and tried to write lot today but wasn't able to get as much done as would have liked um and i'm just gonna probably not sleep for too long tonight so that can get get what need to get done done tomorrow and still know you know i'm gonna try to stay positive and just do everything um so yeah that that the plan i'm i'm stressed 
180,so um today was just very busy day from an academic perspective um just had lot of stuff due and so spent the entire day working on that and was pretty productive pretty efficient still wasn't able to study for my german course nearly as much as would want to which was upsetting um but just need to try to get some sleep and i'm gonna wake up bit early and try to study some german and then go to german course and hopefully not make fool of myself because don't know the content 
181,so um today was kind of rough day had really difficult time in my german course and realized that i'm falling behind in major way and have fallen behind and so now it just matter of kind of fighting to to get caught back up um and so that been very stressful um and then so just spent good part of my day working on that and then also kind of finalized my blocking plans and went through the process of formally inputting blocking stuff which is big relief to kind of be done with that and um and know that have blocking group to be part of and they're all people rea really like and it it all good it should be it should be good and um i'm sleeping less but like said i'm just uh very very worried about my german course and that kind of the main priority and the main concern at this point it lot of work and i'm just not as don't know i've just gotta tell myself that can do it 
182,uh so today good thing that happened was finally used my blocking plans and my german course went bit better than it did yesterday but still i'm just really struggling and i'm starting to panic about how difficult this course has become um and so don't know it just it very stressful and um yeah like said um i'm i'm just worried about being able to catch up and i've never taken course that been this hard for me i've always done well and so this sucks and then i'm also am have quiz tomorrow so just gonna try to get up early tomorrow and study for that um but yeah it should be hopefully i'm just gonna try my best and uh just have lot to do 
183,so today um had my german quiz which was just i'm not don't know how it went we'll have to see we'll have to see um and did my civics class which is like uh going to teach these people in [redacted] and these these kids in [redacted] and it went really well and so i'm excited for this semester um for that reason and also just lot of homework that is like impossible for me to keep up with and i'm just trying and kind of failing um but i'm just trying my best and uh so that bit stressful but like said i'm i'm trying my best and uh and hopefully it all will kind of come together and i'll be able to get done everything need to get done i'm just very stressed and i'm very tired and my sleep schedule has been very kind of out of whack lately um but i'm just gonna you know try to keep working and and pull everything together as as soon as possible and just maintain that 
184,so today was an interesting day had my german course in the morning and that went well and everything went well today but just had th weird interaction at dinner where guess friend of friend was sitting with us and guess she just like didn't was indicating uh via body language that she was like not fan of my personality and my other friend picked up on it and told me about it and that just kinda bothered me and made me think lot about the way behave um so that was not cool and i'm still like myself i'm still like my own i'm so yeah would rather wouldn't uh rather be anyone else um and uh so just have to work tomorrow i'm gonna sleep in i'm not going to my german course tomorrow just 'cause need to sleep and won't be able to sleep in my bed for the next couple of days because my roommate is having his girlfriend over so whatever i'm just gonna sleep tonight um so that should be good and things are good other than that just bit depressed guess but was bit of funk 
185,so today um don't know pretty low-key day uh slept in bit which was nice didn't go to my german course which uh don't feel fine about and then what did do cleaned with um worked with my friend for few hours out in my on-campus job and that was nice he cool kid and then uh what did do just it was nice to talk to him for while afterwards and then came back to my room and uh went to like dinner with my roommate and then like worked for while had some stuff to do like lot of stuff to do and so worked on that then finished that and um it was good day um still have lot to do tomorrow but yeah it was good day not too much to say 
186,so today was kind of rough day um just tried to get lot of studying done just don't wanna be here anymore i'm trying to go to sleep out on the couch in my common room because can't sleep in my bed tonight because my roommate has his girlfriend over and there are just mice in this room and just need to sleep but can't and i'm just bit irritated so that basically i'm just frustrated right now and that what i'm feeling i'm thinking that need to fall asleep that won't be able to because we saw mouse in here last yesterday yeah so i'm just debating what gonna happen i'm uh i've kind of been in heightened state emotionally i'm just very irritated 
187,so today was an extremely difficult day for me um had just rough experience early on and um it was it was tough and usually when would have difficult experience like that would just gonna hate myself after it and then have to do little bit but not as much and i'm proud of myself for that and i'm proud of my original aims throughout the situation it was just difficult day and i'm already at tomorrow and i'm already um i'm glad that tomorrow is new day i'm gonna wake up but i'm gonna try over these next five days i'm gonna commit to giving everything have to to my life to my academics finish strong and then go home for week and um just relax entertain myself constantly and just be relaxed and safe but until then just need to work on my academics and try my best in everything so that can tell myself tried my best and don't know that need to try my best in academics so i'll try just need to try my best in social things and [inaudible] like the issue that had today was kind of an interview-related thing and tried my best in that so i'll just try my best and leave the rest so that kinda the the thing i'm dealing with now 
188,so um today was definitely better day than yesterday but still i'm kind of haunted by the difficult situation had yesterday and think i'm uh you know maybe for while who knows um but don't know saw some of my friends today which was good i'm trying to just stay positive i'm trying to work really hard and ha-have been procrastinating lately so tried to stop that today and get some some work done and i'm just gonna try my best and you know continue um well not continue but start trying to like make make things better and like said just prepare for my midterms and and and hope that everything goes well and feel bit tired lately but i'm just trying to fix my sleep schedule so that that all works well as well and i'm just trying to like focus on loving myself and and things like that 
189,so today was another weird day spent lot of time thinking about that interview and just how horrible it went and ended up getting the position that wanted but still it just know that i've made horrible impression with all the people that i'll be working under and with and just made an absolute fool of myself and that fucking kills me like that so um ugh god it just kills me but have to get over it um it happened and need to work on moving on think every day i'm kind of getting little bit better at that um and then housing day is thursday so i'm looking forward to that and and um figuring out and you know what gonna happen tomorrow night and yeah it should be cool couple of days and and have midterm that need to study more for i've been having issues studying which is another uh another major problem 
190,so today was pretty good day um i'm looking forward to tomorrow which is housing day so that should be pretty exciting um definitely excited for that and uh you know just play it by ear [inaudible] you know don't know it'll be cool day hopefully but i'm not gonna get too worked up about it and um yeah just it was good day had dinner with my friends and didn't study lot i'm i'm worrying lot need to um just focus on on studying and and uh have midterm coming up on friday and really haven't studied very much for it at all um so hopefully tomorrow i'll get chance to to put in few hours um on that and and do little bit better than would if hadn't studied um it difficult course and i've almost kind of given up but uh i'll keep going 
191,um so today was an exciting day because uh it was housing day and so me and my blocking mates were assigned our our house and uh uh we got good house and i'm happy with it and so had all three meals with them today think that was what needed just take break and uh should be good was bit stressed because they all seem to know lot more people in the house than did but don't know i'm i'm glad to glad to be part of the group and you know good things should happen from here and uh have final tomorrow and or midterm rather and i'm very stressed about it um haven't studied too much but i'm just gonna wake up little bit early tomorrow and read some stuff and hope that it goes well i'm just gonna need to try my best to take deep breath and uh you know move on after this then i'm going home on saturday so looking forward to that for sure 
192,um so today was um pretty harsh and uneventful day had my midterm in the morning and that went poorly um but knew it would but got through it and i'm proud of myself for that um to be able to keep level head didn't have panic attack while taking the test like could have had like have like mini panic attacks think sometimes when i'm taking exams that make me like shut down and do really poorly when can do better didn't that didn't happen to me um so that good and then just have to work on you know positive self-thought and stuff like that um and i'm going home tomorrow for week very much looking forward to that still have some assignments to do that are due um thursday or um sunday night rather um yeah just studied bit and uh i'm trying to think yeah that basically it midterm is over and uh traveling home tomorrow 
193,so today was uh uh kind of busy day was traveling back to michigan where live so got on plane and uh so most of the day was travel and preparing for travel and then coming back home um and still did manage to get bit of work done and tomorrow i'm gonna have to write about six pages um which is pretty intense but i'm just trying my best and i've don't know it was good day not much to to happen i'm glad to be home and uh able to have few days to relax um and just do nothing for while which will be really good um and i'm looking forward to that and uh yeah that that about it 
194,so today was very busy day had lot of writing to do and so spent the entire day um writing and uh so that was basically all that happened i've been procrastinating bit lately which has um been bit of problem but um yeah go ended up getting everything done that needed to get done and it was adequate in quality and um now my break really begins [inaudible] for the next five days of relaxation before uh going back to campus and finishing off the semester yeah so hopefully it'll be good uh good couple of days uh i'm looking forward looking forward to them for sure 
195,so didn't do much today um was up late last night working on that um essay had to write so slept in today and it was my first official day of break being that no longer had homework to do so the next five days won't be doing anything really i'll just be relaxing and uh recharging my batteries and waiting to go back and finish off the semester so it was good day and not much happened um am bit frustrated when when am this lazy but know that need to need to be this lazy so that i'll be able to work when get back to school so feel good about everything [inaudible] um probably just something similar tomorrow if not you know i'll try to figure something else out 
196,um so uh let me think um today was pretty relaxed day slept in which was nice um don't know uh it was just peaceful day um i'm gonna try tomorrow to um study bit more for the semester so that i'm prepared going back and use this break as the next couple of days of the break as like the latter half of the break as an opportunity to uh kind of get back to catch up on my academics and get head start for the the rest of the semester so that can finish strong think have um five more days of of free time until the semester reconvenes and so uh basically four more days until go back so i'm just gonna spend that time working hopefully 
197,so today was um pretty productive day uh today was pretty productive day um studied little bit for my german course um got caught up and i'm gonna continue to do that over the next couple of days got back um don't know if it oh wait um yeah so spent the day just at home um you know wit-with my family talking with some people it was nice and uh i'm just uh i'm hoping to get caught up before going back to to school and have some some things on my mind that have to think about which are bit stressful but i'm just gonna get through it and uh you know try my best make that commitment 
199,so today was nice um relaxing day um just you know it was nice took break today and just did stuff that entertained me and stuff like that and it was it was fun it was good um so it was nice to have day like this and then i'm i'm going back to to school today um now that it past midnight so um need to still pack for that and do quite quite bit of stuff when wake up but should have that all under control and then just focusing on um signing myself up for success uh for the rest of the semester and for the summer and and um yeah so that that should be um you know i'm looking forward to to to what to come and trying to get into the right mindset for the finishing out the semester 
200,so today was busy day um in that spent good part of the day traveling uh back to school so had to pack everything and then uh get on plane for few hours and and now i'm back um in school at school and it was also pretty productive read some things watched some stuff had to watch for school um so got got quite bit of stuff done which is good um yeah feeling positive about the rest of the semester and just trying to focus on um getting everything done that need to get done uh tomorrow have quite bit to do as well i'm worried bit about getting my sleep schedule back back on track where it needs to be uh but i'm like said i'm positive and i'm i'm just gonna really try to commit myself as much as can over the course of the coming semester and uh yeah should be good i'm looking forward to it 
201,um so today was good day studied bit i've been more productive than usually am with studying um so that was good um to to do that today and um just have to try to get to bed soon um have 900 am tomorrow but yeah studied bit and had meeting for one of my extracurriculars and then went to dinner with um my block mates which was nice and uh yeah it was it was cool it was an interesting dinner we talked about lot of stuff and just learned some things about them that didn't didn't know and it was kind of weird interesting but also like lot of food for thought came out of it so that was good um my i'm bit worried about getting back into classes but know that i'll do well and that i'm just gotta keep trying and and make it all happen 
202,yeah so today was um my first day back in classes since spring break and and they went pretty well had two classes today and i'm always nervous in my german class but just need to wori work on preparing myself and you know thinking positively about the course and you know it always goes fine like i'm gonna be fine regardless and just need to remember that you know i'm i'm safe it cool then had an uh [inaudible] [pretty] interesting um re-revealing conversations with some of my friends that uh just surprised me and so yeah so just just some dynamics um changing and shifting with that stuff and uh yeah just studied bit and i'm just trying to be more productive for this semester and it was it was good day overall yeah definitely 
203,so um today was pretty good day slept really uh not so good last night um so that that wasn't good but um just yeah so came back to my room and took nap after my classes and then um uh just did some some work and then had dinner with my friends uh so that was nice um it was uh don't know i'm just focusing on getting back into the groove of things which can be bit difficult um it was nice to have the spring break but it kind of think threw me off so i'm working on just getting back in and it all going well and just need to wake up um bit early tomorrow to finish up some homework but yeah i'm happy with how things are going and had some good conversations with my friends today and um and i'm happy with life and kinda i'm gonna think go to the gym tomorrow um and get on that regimen again 
204,so today was um pretty good day not much to talk about was really debating whether or not wanted to go to my german course this morning and got really nervous um beforehand and when got to class but just have to realize that it always goes fine can always get through it just need to you know think positive thoughts to myself and i'm just stressed out by it but think it you know just need to focus on preparing and then you know when get into class kind of doing the best that can uh so that definitely important um and then the rest of the day went and did taught class for one of my extracurricular activities and that always nice um but it bit draining um and yeah it was it was it was good outside of that and um looking forward to the days to come i'm gonna start working more and um yeah so it was good day overall i'm happy with it 
205,so today was an interesting day uh decided to skip my german class in the morning which wasn't sure if wanted to do um but just didn't just wanted to sleep in so didn't go to it and um then had class from 1000 to 1100 and that went well and had meeting with one of my professors about something like had uh written for class and that went pretty well and i'm think might be on the right track with that essay and um still have bit of work to do um but we'll see what comes out of that and then uh had another class and then had dinner with two of my friends uh which was fine guess um just bit down think lately um but it was it was good day overall and um yeah 
206,so um uh today was um uh an okay day woke up um didn't sleep very well last night my roommate had lot of people over um until late in the or early in the morning and it was just keeping me up and it was bit obnoxious um or very obnoxious so slept poorly and then had two-hour german class um and it was really stressful because like the director of undergraduate studies was there like watching us and like evaluating our performance so think had like mini little panic attack while it was happening um but it was all it was all good and got through it um so just gotta remember like you know convince myself that it'll all go well and then it will um and um then like cleaned for like four and half hou or did my like on-campus stuff which is cleaning stuff for like four and half hours um with my friend [redacted] and uh oh shouldn't mention names but whatever uh so we'll say my friend uh and uh and uh yeah that it okay bye 
207,so um today was uh an interesting day uh slept pretty well last night um slept and just because it was really long week was gonna wake up early but decided just to sleep in instead so that was good um and then uh just worked bit on homework was gonna work bit um on my on-campus job but didn't really have time for it so just worked on some homework i'm just stressed out about all the work have to do stressed out that my grades aren't gonna come together stressed out that feel like behind socially and um just like deficient generally is how feel so that really stressing me out and i'm trying to work on that um and just have some issues that are um uh bit stressful and then also summer plans are stressful think have everything decided there but it just don't know thinking [about how] i'm gonna fund everything because i'm gonna be going abroad so uh just feel like i'm lot less uh lot more you know uh just def uh deficient relative to everyone else here so 
208,so um today was pretty productive day uh woke up pretty early to start studying had bit of quite bit of work to do um or fair amount at least and so studied bit and uh and i'm gonna wake up early tomorrow and study bit more and just hope hope that this german test goes well um have test tomorrow and um yeah and then just worked on uh had meeting for one of my extracurriculars and went to that it was pretty easy straightforward um and uh just hoping to get you know do well in my stuff tomorrow and i'm stressed about academics but am just working on improving my reactions and stuff like that don't know i've just never been this stressed about academics before so it um something i'm adjusting to and i'm hopefully doing good job of that um yeah and friend stuff has been weird lately as well but that all it all gonna be fine it'll be good 
209,so today was pretty interesting day felt bit under the weather uh but i'm you know mostly fine was really nervous to go to german class today for some reason i've just been um don't know it just stresses me out lot and get in my own head about it and was just really stressed about it but um that ended up going okay um so that was good in the end and then had another class and then something really exciting came in the mail for me so it was just exciting to to get that um and then had dinner at my house for next year with went to with my blocking gr with my uh blockmates which was nice um was like fine that was fun [i was struck] with that um then came back to my room and studied for bit and that about it it was good day overall um i'm just stressed about lot and things that need to do that i'm not doing but you know typical stuff 
210,so um i'd say today was semi-successful day got quite bit done and made commitment to stop procrastinating and was able to uh stick to it knock on wood um so i'll hopefully try to get uh continue working tomorrow have um big essay due thursday which is really stressing me out and just feel like quite bit is hinging on me doing well in it so i'm just trying to um basically just take what steps can to do well um so that the focus right now yeah just um don't know just uh guess you know my ultimate grade will be out of my control won't determine it but can just take as many steps as can now and put in as much work as can now with the time have left to um hope to you know use the advice i've been given and write as the best essay um possible mean that all can do so that what i'm focusing on now and i'm bit stressed uh but it should be good 
211,um so today was an okay day um uh just have big paper to do tomorrow so i've been focusing on writing that lot and was able to concentrate okay better than usually can um but um still just don't know i'm never gonna be able to get done as much done as want to get done so [inaudible] had an extracurricular today where go into [redacted] and teach 5th-graders some stuff so that was fun and it always good it kind of time commitment but it was uh you know always enjoy it enjoy it this semester so that was cool um and then just came back to my room and worked while i'm just focusing on on uh um the finishing my essay so it bit stressful um but by uh it due tomorrow night so it should all be done by then um and yeah that is about it i'm uh just trying to fi-finish this off as well as can and then move on 
212,uh so today was um like fine day just spent almost the entire day working on my um my essay for uh my writing class so today it was due at midnight and just spent the whole day working on that which was really stressed about and i'm not sure how feel about the ultimate quality of it but it done and i'm moving on with my life now and that been such priority lately have been kind of neglecting my other classes so i'm gonna get up early tomorrow and study bit before my german class and um then hopefully it'll work tomorrow and i'm just focusing on staying on top of things and uh making sure that do everything need to do um and uh you know it it stressful couple of you know weeks but we don't have that much more time left to this semester so i'm just trying to finis-finish strong and tired all the time but you know guess that just how it is 
213,so um had class this morning um which was [fine] and then spent few hours working which is always very tiring so the rest of the day was pretty tired and tried to study bit and um um came back to my room and studied bit then went to get dinner which was nice um but um [okay] [inaudible] to um study some more tomorrow and have some um meetings to go to but should be good and um yeah not much to talk about i'm gonna try to work bit more tomorrow as well um which should be good and um yeah so it was good day got lot done and um yeah that basically it 
214,so today was an okay day had lot of work to do for school but found that wasn't able to do much of it um and so just worked on my on-campus job for like an hour and then um worked bit on my german class um which was fine and then um uh yeah worked bit more and um yeah just had bit of hard time focusing um uh can and um figuring out what wanted to do um um what else oh had dinner with dinner and lunch with some friends which was nice um and tomorrow i'm just gonna try to be more productive um and uh start the week off on the right foot and um yeah so hopefully it all goes well 
216,so today just um have test tomorrow so was studying lot for that and um don't think it'll go very well but i'm just gonna try my best and hope for the best and uh yeah i'm bit nervous about that and um skipped class this morning like do um occasionally um just because don't know didn't really didn't wanna go and and well just ended up staying late and just didn't wanna go to the 900 am [inaudible] be fine um and um i'll be heading to bed now and hopefully just i'm focusing lot on that test and didn't really see any friends today or do too much socially um also had class today at at 100 pm which went to which was fine don't really enjoy that class but just matter of getting through it so yeah things are things are fine and i'll be cool 
217,so um today was pretty good day had my uh test early this morning that went really poorly um but what can you do hopefully uh you know don't know hopefully i'll be able to make up for it um later um yeah so that should be fine or that should be uh something focus on studied lot today and um worked bit on my on-campus job and then had meeting to go to for my summer job um which went fine don't really like the people that are there uh but it it just job you know that all it is really and so um i've just gotta get through that and it should be good then came back to my room and studied bit more uh it was good day overall and uh should be good rest of the week for sure that about it 
218,so today was an interesting day um studied or um slept like okay last night but was just super tired throughout the day so took like two naps and don't feel any shame about it was like really tired and still am um and then um like had lunch with friend had class early that was like not well and it never is but whatever don't care had an extracurricular where talked with uh where um like teach kids and that was really fun enjoy that but it takes like three hours to do um with transportation and everything so it took while um and studied bit and um uh went out to eat for dinner which was nice um and yeah i'm going to bed now i'm just worried bit about what wanna do for the summer i'm considering maybe should try to graduate early stuff like that um yeah so just lot of lot of stuff on my mind but um everything should come together i'm sure 
219,so today was quite busy day um uh um what did do went to my german class in the morning which went well and then um uh had another class which was fine and uh then um ah i'm trying to think of what did slept for while and then um no no didn't sleep for while don't know was in my room for while and then had another class and then got dinner with um what ended up being like quite few of my friends which was nice always like seeing um everyone in my blocking group plus few additional people that was really nice um yeah and then had to studied bit and then had to stay late like until 100 am at my at like 130 am on my on-on-campus like extracurricular activity to edit some stuff so that was stressful but it was good 
220,so got very little sleep um last night um which wasn't cool had to stay out late um and so didn't sleep much and so spent good part of today napping and just kind of laying around but also got some meals with my friends which was nice and studied bit and went to german class which went nice i'm lot less stressed about going to german now that the teacher that we have changed just have to focus on studying this weekend have some stuff to do tomorrow uh training have to attend which is gonna suck but don't have choice so yeah and um it should be hopefully good good day i'm bit stressed but and sh probably should be bit more stressed so just need to start working bit harder probably 
221,so um today was pretty busy day had the training thing for three hours for the summer activity that i'm doing um which was really nervous about because in the past i've like not done well around these people but it went fine and have more of that tomorrow so that'll hopefully go fine and whatever have lot of work to do tomorrow also like school stuff um which is don't know i'm just i'm i'm just behind academically and need to get caught up and every day it gets bit trickier to get caught up but just there not enough hours in the day so it just don't know trying to do it all and not really being able to which is stressful but that pretty normal and i'm just um interested to see how things are going to pan out ultimately and yeah that that about it i'm bit stressed but i'm trying to stay positive and just figure out what else can do to grow and things like that 
222,so today was once again pretty busy day had training for about three hours um for one of my extracurricular activities here on campus um and um so just did did quite bit of work for that and then um studied little bit [inaudible] something to write from uh my classes i'm just stressed lot but i'm i'm feeling bit more hopeful i've kind of given up on [inaudible] classes and it just about finding motivation to push through mean so yeah just need to realize that um um can't change with the grades i've already gotten in the class but can do my best to bring up the remaining um quizzes and things like that so it bit stressful but i'll figure it out as it comes 
223,so today was pretty good day had german class this morning and it went it went fine got through it um and then had lunch with friend and then um what else did do studied for while um don't know i've uh the test tomorrow that i'm bit nervous about but i've studied for it more than have for the previous tests i'm gonna get up early and study for it some more and hopefully i'll do well on it um it just lot of stuff and it kind of overwhelming academically and looking forward to the end of the semester and uh what else there lot of kind of social pressures at the moment uh so i'm not sure what gonna happen with those but um yeah it it was pretty good day hopefully tomorrow the test would go well i'm bit nervous about it and um had lot of caffeine today so hopefully i'll be able to sleep well i'm sure won't be and took some melatonin okay so that about it 
224,so today was pretty good day had test in my german class that was worried lot about and um hope it went well don't know if it did but tried my best on it and studied for it and think was more prepared going in or at least felt more prepared than was in the last one so who knows guess um what what get at this point is it doesn't really matter and um then slept [inaudible] and just extremely extremely tired lately and probably haven't been getting enough sleep uh but i've i've just been very tired and just probably not helped by the fact that i'm going to sleep at 200 am to wake up for 900 am class but yeah so that about that about it there i'm just stressed but and bit frustrated with life at the moment but got some good news back today so i'm happy about that for sure yeah i'm very happy somewhat 
225,so today was stressful day but um it was fine had my german class in the morning and that went fine that um going better lately knock on wood um but i'm hopefully gonna prepare bit more in the morning um and then had di uh lunch with friend then just studied for while um have uh an assignment an essay assignment to do in my writing class that i'm just having like very hard time coming up um uh topic and everyone else already has their topics and the teacher actually reached out to me to to give me specific help so that stressful but um yeah i'm just bit worried about some social things just have lot on my plate that i'm not really taking care of but um yeah and so that basically it it was fine day overall 
226,so today was an interesting day um classes went well and everything and um yeah th so that was all fine um actually uh there was one of my stress one of my classes that stressed me out because can't figure out what want to write about and think kind of figured out something today but still don't really know and i'm just it never good to feel behind um and like you're not on top of things just need to work on getting on top of things and starting to improve my life um have uh my grandpa is not doing well he in the hospital and he may not um uh be around for much longer hope that he is and it seems like he getting better so that good news um it um [inaudible] of course i'm very saddened by it and and well [inaudible] well it seems that it seems that he getting better so guess am optimistic and i'm i'm not thinking the worst right now i'm not expecting the worst um and don't don't know guess i'm not with him so don't know how bad it is but i'm not expecting the worst and i'm not thinking to myself that he going to die i'm not even considering it really but um i'm just hoping that my family keeps me updated 
227,so today was oops just dropped my phone um today was pretty good day um had class for two hours which went fine and then saw few friends for lunch which was nice and um spent the rest of the day studying and had few things to do but um yeah good day overall not much to talk about there was big party on campus that didn't end up going to i'm gonna just stay in and then study yeah really have to work on studying but um yeah things things were good today overall pretty good day hmm hopeful and went to the gym as well 
228,so um today was just stressful day in uh multiple ways because as the day went by realized that had more academic like assignments to complete that didn't realize so tomorrow should be very busy day and have i'm not don't know oh god yeah so i've kind of painted myself into corner and i'm bit fucked now but we'll just have to see what happens and um yeah so i'm stressed but i'm just gonna try to give it my best tomorrow and see where it gets me um yeah so it it should be you know should be able to get through it hopefully uh i'll just try my best you know am who am can't go back in time all can do is try my best from here so uh that what i'll do and uh yeah that about it quite bit of work to do lot on my plate for sure 
229,yeah so today had just lot of academic stuff to do lot of stuff i'm very very busy almost as busy as i've ever been academically um and tomorrow is going to need to be the most productive day i've had in my life because just realized have five-page paper due that haven't started yet um and it is 10 of my grade plus quiz that need to study for that uh this is on tuesday and don't know anything for it yet or yeah so very little for it yet so tomorrow needs to be the most productive day of my life and need to like get in the zone and and just be ready for it i'm gonna work very hard so that um you know ge so that don't know so the things this essay and the quiz contribute to grades so i'm gonna try to do well in them so that can boost my grades up um so i'm gonna yeah by working hard tomorrow i'll be able to kind of kick my grades in the upward direction which is very good in the long run um so yeah that about it and also had this weird thing up at friend today we went to like an escape room and uh [inaudible] wasn't very fun wasn't into it and it just kind of reveals the like because was with my blocking group and think it just kind of revealed the um don't know uh think lot of our personalities came up and revealed bit of think confli-conflict within the group and um don't know [inaudible] it don't know it important that we all have friends outside the blocking group which i've known before that but it just verified that they're all cool guys though that about it 
230,so today was um pretty busy day um am just very tired had lot of work to do lot of academic stuff to do um so worked on getting that all done and um yeah saw my friends we figured out our housing stuff um and so that was stressful what else is going on have quiz tomorrow that i'm not really prepared for but what can you do um yeah so it was just stressful day and things are getting things are gonna get tough especially as the year comes to close it just stressful i'm looking forward to 24 hours from now i'm just gonna push my problems onto tomorrow so go to sleep for little bit and then study some more and that is about it 
231,so today was um pretty busy day um uh just had lot to do had class in the morning and uh took test in it and it went poorly but don't really give shit and then napped for half of it and decided just to skip my writing class to nap and feel fine about that as well and then had lunch um with my friends out at our new house next year and dropped off some housing forms and then um worked uh couple hours got got bit done then had meeting oh then had dinner again with the same people and then had meeting with few other people that was really nervous about and do don't know struggle bit in those types of settings but did better this time than did last time so that good and then uh came back to my room worked bit more and uh it was good day overall 
232,um so today was um an okay day had german class in the morning and um and that uh went went fine guess and then um uh had lunch with friend and then um went back to my room and eventually went to the gym and exercised bit which was good step in the right direction and um yeah i'm just stressed lot about academic things stressed about some summer plans and uh just lot on lot on my plate lot wanna do and just don't have time for all of it or the the willpower i'm stressed about grades lot as well and typical things but um yeah i'm just gonna try my best something i'm rarely rarely able to do 
234,so today was fine day had my german class in the morning and that went fine and then had lunch and then worked for little bit with friend of mine on our on-campus job and that went fine um and don't know it was good day overall have lot of work to do for my german course and i'm just as usual struggling to find the the motivation to do it uh so that don't know it not great but um yeah i've don't know just have lot of work to do lot of work to do which sucks but um yeah we'll see what happens suppose lot of stuff going on this weekend 
235,so today was um pretty good day um had lot of stuff to do um uh hosting someone to visit us from my hometown so spent some time with him showed him around um that was fun and then saw some of my friends for meals it was little event at an upperclassman house that went to which was fun um well actually it wasn't fun like at all but it was like it happened and so it was fine guess and um yeah that about it came back to my apartment and straight to bed i've had issues um with motivation lately so that something i'm focusing on and i'm just kinda pushing forward and finishing up this semester um on as high note as possibly can so that about it 
236,yeah so today was another busy day um uh continued hosting this kid from my hometown for visit to us which was nice um and just had lot of work to do lot of studying um things like that and just um towards the end of the day got really stressed out that have so much to do for my midterm and don't even know where to start so i'm very stressed about that and finding finding the time to do everything that need to do and there not enough hours in the day honestly need to stop procrastinating and start getting on it um and thinking about motivation and why i'm doing what i'm doing i'm doing it so that get good grades and that have you know better future ultimately so that what on my mind 
237,so um i've just been little bit um think uh in kind of funk lately i've been really down on myself and i've just few minutes ago kind of contextualized put things into perspective and just thought to myself like don't know there like i'm doing very well overall uh and i'm just gonna need to take stock of my life and realize that i'm at really great school um i'm on the right track in life i'm way ahead of most of other 19-year-olds um and have more potential and just am more capable and things like that um but there are some kinks that need to work out some issues that need to be resolved and some are just like normal wear and tear but some are like don't know bigger personality issues that have so i'm thinking about that lot 
238,so today was pretty good day overall just um the next two weeks have lot of academic stuff going on and just need to make the commitment to dedicate the next 14 days of my life to improving the rest of my life and um realizing that i'm not gonna get in all my classes but if spend the next 14 days working as hard as possible can get higher grades than would if i'm continue in the same trajectory right now um and so that what need to think about and um had my german class today it went fine uh uh don't know had lot of questions today and for some reason can't think about what did don't know like studied little bit what did do oh god can't even remember what did today but few things yeah and it was productive day somewhat and um yeah it was good day but just need to find motivation you know within me without doubt 
239,so today was long day um had my german class in the morning which would you know don't know it just yeah so that happened and then had meeting with my um professor for one of my writing assignments and um just have lot of work to do um that assignment um is due may 6th so have think about 10 days to work on it um and actu-actually had lot of critique but lot of like really substantive stuff so i'll be able to like go from there and write good essay and and do know the work need to take need to do um so that that good and then um studied for little bit met with someone um and what else did do uh had big test kind of competency test i'm staying after school for few weeks to like work on cleaning team and be captain of team and um had big test for that and then like don't know was nervous beforehand but was able to like [hype] myself up and it was fine going in was really fine going in and then was fine you know throughout and fine leaving but don't know just had lot of critiques but think lot of like stuff need to learn yeah so i'm i'm really miffed about part of it but it was good day overall yeah don't know this [bitch] had kind of an attitude which irritated me but whatever ugh whatever okay that all 
240,yeah so today was long day hadn't sleep too well last night and uh got up early for my german class which meets at o'clock in the morning uh so don't know decided was planning on going to germany over the summer with the with the program here [inaudible] but decided that i'm not it not worth it to spend the money and really don't wanna go and am not at the level where could go so that was tough choice but i'm making it and um so i'm really home for the summer and uh hopefully spend lot of time alone hmm yeah just uh feel like so much of the choices make now the way that live my life is for other people and compare myself to others constantly so need to just try to get away from that and recharge my batteries and wanna do that over the summer 
241,so um today was not as productive of day as would have hoped originally um don't know did some work it was fine talked to my friends it was fine don't know it was fine day whatever not much to talk about i'm feeling fine worried about my finals but just need to think about my competition um and do as well as can yup so that is about it um yeah [inaudible]
