9,it was nice to have new faces and people to recognize and say hi to in passing today uh those people met from my academic classes this past week it was first week of classes so uh just having short conversations saying hi in passing uh was new and good with those said most of the people spent time with today was my the sa uh the same close group of friends uh on another note uh there was one people in particular today who uh pleasa who was pleasantly surprised with uh had preexisting idea of how thought he would be thought he would be significantly tougher and meaner than he actually ended up being those was um positive experience um he accommodated me and friends need today um and thought he would um give me lot harder of time about it um so those felt good overall uh not particularly stressful day um went to classes went to practice went to lift uh nothing particularly out of the ordinary 
10,today was good day feel like made some good connections with people on the mbta and at the red sox game uh and just in general saw lot of people and even just made quick conversation with um people that had never met before um found some cool connections that didn't know before uh it was great seeing old high school friends at the red sox game today went with them that was definitely positive and it definitely high point in my day um today low point would have been one particular class that the material was uh particularly difficult but know i'll have the weekend to look over the material and uh reinforce that and learn it more and worst case go to office hours and get that squared away didn't cause any stress or anxiety just um little frustration i'd say that it didn't come easily in class the other class today was quite easy and no trouble at all made me feel good uh baseball practice was uh good no stress there um the workout was um intense but definitely uh we made it fun uh all in all no complaints 
11,mostly likely did not get enough sleep last night i'd say woke up too early to loud noises outside that definitely um i'd say was it kind of threw my day off woke up with headache um which had the day before um after getting pretty carsick um so woke up with headache think it might be my sinuses um didn't impact my interactions with other people um not at all today did some work um by myself um and then at meals was really my social time uh went out with friends sat down with people didn't know and chatted up and met some new people um went out with friends this evening um and had had fun but um other than that i'd say uh emotionally felt good um oh did take nap which sometimes do especially after exercise um especially when don't feel like got enough sleep the night before um and right now i'm going to bed far too late so interesting to see what tomorrow will bring 
12,today started with waking up little earlier than anticipated or wanted woke up uh with headache um from my sinuses um which could be allergies could be catching little um bug or getting over little bug but it didn't interfere with my day uh the people interacted with today were friends and i'd say friends of friends i've met some new people um and made some connections with them uh just conversation uh and it uh stayed in the dorm watched some uh football and we did some work together not super stressful well in advance of the deadline which is at the end of the week um but with that said um felt good to get uh the majority of my work done for the week today uh and it were fairly low stress today uh nothing really pressing uh i'd say it were pretty even kill day no super highs no super low um which in all honesty is pretty good 
13,today started off on the wrong foot i'd say got up pass-passed my alarm and almost showed up late to practice at 700 am this morning uh that was uh definitely stressor early in the morning that didn't really anticipate uh with that said um i'd say learned my lesson but also got some good support from my peers and teammates um telling me that no big deal and it happens to everybody and that was uh good to see out of my teammates uh after that class was no problem uh no academic stress today um trying to get ahead in one class in particular um with the problem set due at the end of the week did finished my math problem set due wednesday so gave um didn't procrastinate that and usually do not have problem procrastinating um if anything try and get everything done as soon as possible um other than that spent some good time with teammates and friends at dinner um and we just hang out for while came back and didn't have really more work to get done tonight so um cleaning the room actually was kind of de-stressor for me um and with that said the stressor from the beginning of the day really hasn't uh lingered it was more short-term acute stress um but other than that you know try and get good night sleep tonight uh and win the day tomorrow 
14,today started with good good night sleep and felt well rested showered went to breakfast and felt and at breakfast uh got some work done which felt good felt pretty determined uh got that work done in reasonable amount of time uh after that work was done felt uh towards the afternoon during my afternoon class felt little lethargic in the in the lecture but that could have been combination of the class or maybe um don't know why after that headed over to the across the river for practice and lift where feel like my energy um increased again with that said i'd say my muscles was particularly or out of the ordinary they was sore and tight um think that worth noting uh after that um met up with uh friends and spent some time working on homework together uh in very non-stressful way 
15,today was fairly bland day i'd say felt like was just going through the motions of my three classes my day was pretty pretty jampacked uh with classes and tried to get little work done in between uh think feel uh i'd say physically sore from yesterday workout which mentally makes me feel good feel like uh that makes me happy like did good job but think energy level-wise it might makes me little bit slower um which don't know if can say impacted how my day was but it was something noticed throughout the day um in terms of relationships i'd mean uh dealt with lot of not lot of people today but um in-class discussions and um an entryway meeting uh with lot of people so there was lot of uh communication today uh think what need to do is call home and just touch base um with uh parents and brother and just see how they're doing and think that'll uh that'll be beneficial 
16,today was good day with not too many highs or too many lows or any it was well structured day in the with the bookends in the morning and night doing work and in the middle uh going to class and practice and lift and all of those things went really well uh felt focused and felt like could get my work done uh efficiently wasn't wasting whole lot of time feel like knew what had to get done and got it done uh and good amount of my work was with others which usually uh don't do so those was um productive and wasn't sure if it would be uh especially going to office hours with with teacher and with large group of people uh working in those group setting was definitely productive uh yeah no no complaints on the day uh didn't really others than in like an academic standni standpoint didn't really have any interactions with others people those was out of the ordinary beyond friends and seeing people in passing um think the day started with good night sleep which will try to get tonight 
17,today was normal day uh will say felt particularly productive in the um time that was doing work uh as far as classes went they felt like was focused and following along without any problem uh i'd say interactions with people today was was good no i'd say nothing out of the ordinary um met some new people today um and had some conversations but nothing particularly deep um they was nice calling home today and chatting with the folks hopefully planning on seeing them tomorrow um that was definitely good definitely nice to touch um touch base with them and i'd say in terms of uh eating today um had little extra dessert that probably didn't need today but uh they was hard workout so my legs are pretty sore and um we'll see how feel tomorrow 
19,today started with probably not enough sleep um my sleeping hours uh were little later than usual um had plenty of energy early in the day and then i'd say around o'clock got um fairly tired but didn't want to take nap because thought it would uh hinder tonight sleep and there wasn't whole lot of anything going on today just kind of went through the emotions feel um dealing with people who are just normal friends noth nobody no new connections made today um in the my free time just did work that had due um this upcoming week um nothing particularly noteworthy uh or difficult um felt felt fine today um just uh wish got my normal sleep because tomorrow have to get up particularly early for practice uh so think that are the big key are my sleep and that leads to more productivity 
20,today started off early with me waking up at 530 in the morning for um 700 am practice which think actually kickstarted my day on good note uh noticed had i'd say normal amount of energy even though woke up earlier um but was noticeably more positive and i'd say more personable today even had somebody comment on uh me being in uh good mood which was uh didn't mean always try to be as positive as can but didn't think that waking up at 530 would help that um with that said um after dinner was pretty tired and uh didn't have as much energy as wanted to get some work done but that work isn't due till the end of the week so it no problem during the day uh spent lot of time uh at baseball both in the morning and afternoon with class in between and then did homework after class um so it was really uh bookend my day was bookended with the baseball activity with uh school work in between 
21,today started off on good note with good night sleep felt well-rested then went and got breakfast and had good amount of time before my first class and didn't have ton of work to get done so the work that did have to do or uh yeah that due tomorrow just kinda took it slow and wasn't particularly like determined to get it done very quickly or um anything like that which guess is noteworthy then had ton of class two sections back to back and then class an hour-and-a-half lecture right after that so had tw three and half hours of class in row right over lunch so made peanut butter and jelly and ate that during class during lecture but then ran to lunch and got the tail-end of lunch and sat down with somebody who met um before but never really chatted with and so we had good conversation with him and the other kid he was sitting with so it was fun um to get to know that two guys then had good good lift uh with the team and then went back to back to uh dinner with my with the team uh when got back to the dorm uh my roommate wasn't um in the best mood because he um got an bad news today but th think did my best to try and help him through that situation and just talk to him about it nothing awful awful but uh definitely tough situation that he needs that tried to help him work through um and then met friend after that and didn't really do any work this evening uh now it time for bed 
22,today was normal day with no apparent highs or lows felt pretty even-keeled all day um three classes today so that took up the majority of my time but will say time in between classes and after classes felt particularly don't know if particularly productive is the right word but felt like was always doing work not overwhelmed by the work but always felt like was getting was always getting work done which was good feeling and didn't feel like wasted whole lot of time today no baseball today which meant that focused on school um in terms of interactions with people i'd say did have dinner with some people that um had only met quickly in the past and so that was cool to have conversation with them and uh yeah make some connections with them uh after dinner worked with first independently on work and was very productive and then uh when buddy showed up we got some work done together as well and yeah that just really [inaudible] so we kinda chill out uh tonight i'll hopefully get good night sleep and have good day tomorrow 
23,today started waking up feeling like got good night sleep went to breakfast and then had time before my first class to get some reading done that due tomorrow and felt productive in that i'd say hour block of time then class was good no problem and then around the lunch hour uh that was some down time to decompress eat um talk with friends and uh ev got to chat with my dad which is good to touch base with him uh and talk with him on the phone then went to lecture and then to uh practice which was long it was practice and then after practice it was uh workout [lift] which uh was long but felt like my focus didn't waiver in was always doing something which uh felt good and then right from there [inaudible] ate dinner and ran to my office hour for um problem [set] class due tomorrow and that was really beneficial got lot out of that um that was super helpful and felt productive during that uh block of time as well after that met up with some friends to uh to work through some problem and then called it night um all in all felt very productive in my little free time had which always makes me feel good don't think wasted any time today didn't really have much time to waste so uh that that pressure of the time actually think helped me today with my productivity and uh with that said um good amount of the work was with other people so uh wasn't completely isolated today 
24,today was pretty even-keel day i'd say it started went really right from breakfast to class to lunch to class to baseball uh then right to and then got right to work getting some work done that was it due monday and then to dinner and then back to some work that wanted to get done also due monday um that knowing that tomorrow probably lot of work won't get done felt uh could focus on work that due in the future considering there tests next week in one class and just know i'll get more work um wouldn't say was stre was definitely not stressed out about it but did feel determined to get it done and did uh it pretty underwhelming night really didn't do much of anything just kinda hung out with some friends and then came back to the dorm and now am going to bed and will hopefully plan on having uh good day tomorrow 
25,today was good day which started with uh waking up at reasonable hour and getting breakfast and then actually getting some good uh productive reading done this morning and then headed over to the football game which was good social event um hung out with some friends and then had very long baseball practice which was good it was uh fun just long um but it was uh no stress super uh super we kept it super fun and then uh dinner and then went out um to party or two and had fun there dealing with um people met some new people which was good and had uh some good conversations with them uh yeah it was fun meeting new people there wasn't whole lot of stress today uh if any and i'd say it was plus day uh with uh almost all of my time was um with others and if wasn't with others was in my room doing little bit of reading but not just one reading assignment 
26,looking back on today it was really just doing schoolwork and eating today funny as that sounds uh got up later than usual and started reading then went to eat got went to th right to the library and worked pretty much until my computer died then um came back and had snack and changed think what helped me today was switched uh the subject that was working in and then uh kept working till dinner and got that one uh paper done before dinner and then after dinner was all studying for my first uh midterm exam which is this upcoming thursday and i'm going to bed before an early morning practice at 700 am tomorrow uh set list of things needed to get done today and uh got to almost all of it um just one study guide didn't complete uh for the test thursday but that wanted to get done so guess wish got that done and uh felt like could have but um the really no interactions or meaningful interactions other than with my roommates and few friends at meals other than that it was just working day 
27,today started bright and early with 700 am conditioning practice this morning um which think benefits my day um getting up that early and starting with some physical exercise actually have more energy and then feel more awake during the academic part of my day after that uh after the conditioning went um and ate and then went to class um yeah and then in in between got some miscellaneous work done um really any spare time had today was doing some sort of work either getting ahead or filling out study guide or um doing other work uh then in the afternoon my it was nice to see my mom who picked me up and took me to the doctor for my back which have been long-term injury uh stress fracture which have been it been healing for months and months but it still not better but um and that that seems to always be on my mind my back sort of since spring every day that really like priority that always been on my mind but it was good seeing my mom and uh the doctor [inaudible] status quo so that was to be expected um then got back uh after dinner with mom and really just did as much work as could until um felt like wasn't being uh as productive or i'd finished with what wanted to get done and then went and now i'm going to bed but overall felt really determined to get the work done and had really really good focus 
28,today started with waking up before my alarm on my own naturally um and think it worth noting i've seen think feel better when wake up naturally which uh uh is would be before the alarm um and feel like have more energy even if might be getting little bit less sleep for whatever reason um and especially like if go back to bed after getting up or waking up it going to the bathroom or whatever it just not the same and end up being more groggy than before so got up earlier than anticipated and um got some solid work in after after breakfast but before class and then had class for gosh three and half hours in row in the middle of the day and then uh even got little bit of work done before uh team workout at 500 which really felt like really needed it was good de-stressor for today um had have just like good amount of work more work than usual but nothing crazy at all um and that changed when my test scheduled for thursday was rescheduled for next tuesday so um that definitely lightened the load as well but the workout was uh really good and um like said much needed felt like um left feeling tired and sore after the workout but will say during dinner after workout was dead tired dead tired um and so think the physical uh tiredness hu in my legs from the workout just took it out of me and um took my overall energy just just drained so it was much tougher to get motivated to do work this evening and really didn't need to get whole lot more done um and got whatever needed to get done done but it just was at slow pace um with friend and just not all that focused like earlier in the day 
29,today was fairly uneventful day feel like uh was very productive um before my classes or not before but in between my classes and um yeah before classes bef-before the evening and then once the evening hit my productivity just kinda hit wall and wasn't all that determined to get my work done uh have on wednesdays have lot of classes um but don't even think that quote-unquote took lot out of me it was just just my mood don't know what it was um really um looking back wish had got more done but it was also difficult material and um might need help on it tomorrow so receive the help that need um to get it done tomorrow then in terms of dealing with people chatted with my dad today which was awesome then got the rundown on how the family doing and everything um so time for bed 
30,today was interesting because only really have one assignment of work due tomorrow but it was big old set that uh had good amount done but god it took me while to do it with um some classmates so that was the majority of my work outside of class and practice but um with that said uh was at prac was at baseball from after my two th after my class ended at 230 so would say from o'clock all the way till 630 645 um and so that um was the majority of my day and before and after that [inaudible] class was just all working of this set which felt had good amount of uh focus on and was um pretty determined to get it uh done and do it well uh my night really included just going to office hours and then working with others after the office hours to figure it out which felt good um i'd say my energy level was um was good throughout the day and then in the afternoon when had practice it really dipped felt but then during the workout at 500 530 to 630 i'd say hit had second wind and um rode that energy [that] felt really energized during and after so um yeah rode that energy throughout to get the work done and now am here going to bed 
31,today was another uneventful day unfortunately say um got up went to class um and had some work due in those class so um those was uh those went fine and then in the afternoon went right over to baseball um and had practice but it uh might think it today was don't know why today was tougher than usual uh mentally because uh because i'm injured can't participate so don't know think it just noteworthy those today was um it was tougher on me mentally the the fact those couldn't participate um so then did what could um in the gym after riding the bike got some energy out which think helped then just went back and got some work done um crushed math problem set uh crushed some assignment due in econ and um those made me feel good about it myself and then just hung out with friends didn't really do anything because i've got early morning tomorrow um and now going to bed 
32,today was again day that started bright and early uh woke up early uh to get to baseball and we had bus that went to the other side of massachusetts for scrimmage today and uh it was long it was cold and think the worse part was didn't get to play because i'm injured so today was the first day first game that had to miss mean it just scrimmage and think the think the injury will heal but it just tough being on sidelined doing other duties during the game and not being able to participate so that might've taken toll on me mentally but other than that the bus ride there was long but got little work done studying done then after the game got little studying done and then just hung out with mean hung out with friends but goodness the whole day was baseball from uh 700 am till 700 no 800 830 pm so it was all of my day and then the little time could did work 
33,today was tough day i'm doing the recording little early because was just reflecting on my day and thought it would make more sense to do it now uh i'd say first um think all the stress that um was putting off kind of hit today and and the stress being um three my first three midterm exams are [inaudible] are in two-day span on tuesday wednesday this week um my back injury that still isn't healing that i've had for months and months and months um has kind of been hurting so uh that two um that two factors kind of played into my day um actually went to lunch with friend and few friend and one of their parents took us to lunch which was nice to meet them um and felt fully engaged in that and but the stress did not impact that at all but once got back and settled in just started doing work started to study got frustrated um not as productive as wanted to be um but guess mean looking back was fairly productive um and so just out of nowhere my dad reached out and just about something else and uh he could tell that wasn't doing too well so uh mom and dad came took us to dinner tonight and so that support was incredible um really lucky to has family close by um and yeah just touching base with them was uh was really positive um now early early morning tomorrow with 700 are practice which mean i'm gonna try to get to bed early think lack of sleep the last night or last few night are doing lot it kind of piled up so think it worthwhile to get the week off on the right foot by having good night sleep tonight and think that really impact my uh my day 
34,today was very productive day because didn't have much other choice um it started early with with baseball conditioning 700 am and as much as um would like to sleep little longer think it kick-starts my day um then went to class and after class wrote out hour by hour what was gonna do studying-wise and stuck to that plan and really just studied from 100 to dinner time and then after dinner kept studying um will say that i'm feeling little sick especially um stomach bugs stomach ache and may be getting little congested so that two together um made it little harder to concentrate than would've liked to but um all in all felt like got the work that needed to get done um and wanna get good night sleep for tomorrow exams 
35,today was uh first for me um first to college midterm exams um in the books um feel as if um they went well uh honestly uh do think they took lot out of me not lot out of me they they was they they was like normal test at they was what expected um but just the fact that had let see oh over three hours of test-taking today um that um prevented me from being able to focus on studying for tomorrow exams uh as much as wanted to guess um with that said tomorrow exams will definitely be harder than today two um or than the two today and i'd say little little anxious more just not knowing what to expect know they hard and feel like i've put in the time but don't know if understand the information as well as would like um so little bit of uh anxiousness with that coming down otherwise felt little the stomach bug is little better um not ideal um but uh think good night sleep will help have early morning tomorrow o'clock workout so time for bed 
36,today started uh with good with good note had 830 am lift that uh think kickstarted my day and um it was good felt productive um definitely needed workout today and i'm glad got it um think said before love the the uh tired feeling after workout um with my muscles so like that was good um feeling and it felt like needed to get it in especially knowing the rest of my day was went from the workout to class to lunch to two hours of review for um big exam to two hours of more class and then um studied little dinner and the exam so the day was really building up to the exam from 730 to 900-ish and that was definitely my toughest exam uh but at the end of the day think it'll all work out don't think did amazing but i'm not wasn't too stressed about it which was which was good uh going to bed now uh and feel good that all my midterms am over so far 
37,today was good low-stress day after my three midterm exams the past two day um today was pretty pretty low pretty pretty low-key not whole like said no real stressors today uh didn't have class till 1100 so got up uh got some things done before then then went to class um till 230 then headed over to practice and lift um where felt like got good lift in and ate dinner and then got only had one homework assignment done so did that with teammate got that done uh fairly quickly and thought i'd be in bed lot earlier than am which guess i'm little upset with about my about myself but um you know what called home and chatted with the folks for long time which was good and um that call was well worth um going to bed little later so all in all good uh low-stress day think more of the same it will be tomorrow 
39,today was great day and uh including last night when came went back home and saw good amount of my friends uh from high school who came home for columbus day weekend uh we hung out last night and slept over uh friends house and then woke up and went home today and saw my mom dad and surprised my brother which was great seeing him um haven't been able to see him as much so that was awesome spent some time with him and this afternoon went with um the same friends to college football game and where saw even more people from my high school um and we so we all just met up and went to the game and uh had blast uh hanging out before the game um and during the game and met some uh good amount of new people uh like roommates and friends at this college so um super i'd say seeing my friends from high school it was uh it was probably damn near the most happy i've been uh since i've been away at school absolutely just seeing him was just the best um and that carried through the whole day was uh super super happy super uh enthusiastic and uh now i'm going to sleep back in the dorm because have to get up for baseball tomorrow 
40,today was baseball day started early and going to the field and we played two games back to back so was in the locker room at 815 and didn't get out of the locker room till 630 at night so was there all day with my team playing another local school which was fun we played super well um uh i'm still injured which wasn't uh as bad today usually it it always on my mind and it is always on my mind but today the energy was better think my think was more positive today um then just did the best job could as teammate and that guess at all that all can do after the games went and grabbed dinner with my father in [redacted] and it was good to have little one-on-one with him just talking talking about everything really um that was uh definitely highlight of the day um hung out with some friends this evening and going to bed now 
41,today started uh getting up doing some chores around the dorm um or cleaning like cleaning and stuff like that and and then got lunch and with uh some friends at the dining hall uh before that got one assignment done that due wednesday after lunch went over to the baseball facilities and had conditioning practice and after that spent time with the team uh watching the red sox game on television unfortunately they lost um but uh we watched that with good amount of the guys uh in the locker room uh then went to dinner at the dining hall and got back to the dorm and just sat down and started writing um paper due friday but wanna get they done early um because of other assignment that'll be due later in the week so um hopefully i'll be able to be productive didn't get as much of they done as wanted but feel like guess i'm in good spot and hopefully will be able to do they tomorrow morning uh in terms of spending time with other people today um didn't mind the alone time today for whatever reason uh just being trying to be as productive as could um with the work had 
42,today started uh at reasonable hour thought got good amount of hour of sleep but felt felt tired waking up which is odd because think got at least eight hour of sleep so uh that was something noteworthy um went got breakfast um well before class and in that window of time i'd say hour and ha two hour hour and half before class started got some uh good work done and finished up paper was told myself was gonna finish it and did um so that felt good felt productive then went to class um tuesdays have class from 1100 to 230 uh and then at 230 um got lunch and then we had baseball meeting and then baseball meeting to uh team workout uh which was particularly tough workout felt um yeah didn't feel as strong as did with doing the same workout last week which was um noteworthy again uh got dinner after and then tried to do some the econ problem set which is due friday um but wasn't really all that focused wasn't didn't really have the drive to do it was kinda burnt out think and so mean only got like the first problem done and then uh went to brain break and socialized just hang out and now i'm going to bed 
43,today started waking up uh before my alarm and uh going to the bathroom then when went back to sleep uh after getting up to the alarm had less energy uh than had gotten up without the alarm uh think that noteworthy and tomorrow morning if it happens again think might just get up and start my day um otherwise very bland day um nothing particularly noteworthy uh class went by fine um nothing standing out as particularly um hard um an uh had dinner with um an actually met new person at dinner which was uh cool to talk to them uh and then just did work uh with buddy which was productive uh for assignment due friday um think the workload um has died down since midterms was last week uh so that relief so i'm feeling better about that um in general guess feel like wish had more time to do um not baseball and not school work so uh just an free time whether it be just to read or um for pleasure or um do an things just not baseball or school-related that really all i'm feeling uh in addition today my back was pretty tight um caused an discomfort um again i'm has an injury uh there but um it was particularly uncomfortable all day so i'll try and get that um sorted out tomorrow 
44,this morning started off um waking up before my alarm and getting up out of bed before my alarm uh so think when my body naturally got up just made the most sense to get up and start my day um it was good because had class didn't start till 1100 so got to go over to the athletics um across the river and get some physical therapy in for my back which was sore today um so got that um did some work with that uh went to class no problem at all um could focus fine uh went back across the river for practice and lift um where felt again felt fine just kinda normal no-not too high not too low um had dinner and then went and did um problem set due tomorrow uh with others at office hours and um i'd say had moderate focus i'd say had most of it done and just needed some had few questions um but yeah i'd just say moderately focused not um not my best not my worst um and now after that finished that so time for bed 
45,today was fairly normal day i'd say noticed at some points my had positive demeanor was pretty pretty happy looking forward think maybe it 'cause it was friday looking forward to the weekend um but yeah uh classes went fine and uh but was looking forward to the baseball conditioning workout today um and just had to plan for the afternoon to get better and stuck to it and uh made me feel good um after um after practice went to um basketball event um at their new gym which was fun to uh socialize with friends and see the basketball team play um and then really didn't do much else just uh watched some baseball um back at the dorm and then now going to sleep no nothing uh too high or too low today 
46,today started with big window of time that utilized to get some work done to get ahead on the week uh just went to breakfast and started doing homework and did homework till till lunchtime and um feel like could have been little bit more productive with the time but um think always feel that way uh after lunch went to baseball for the whole afternoon and um it tough because can't participate so do as much as can uh afterwards went out to dinner and then went out uh this evening and uh had good time uh with some friends and met some new people which was nice uh going to bed now uh and i'll hopefully have productive schoolwork day tomorrow

57,today started with pretty awful night sleep uh it was super hot in the room last night and uh woke up at about 400 am think and couldn't fall back asleep till like 530 am it was terrible it was oh like it was super super hot um super uncomfortable and uh took me lot to fall back asleep uh which usually do not have problem with uh so th guess thought i'd have less energy than did uh but it was all right it was all right uh felt fine in class maybe little bit yeah felt fine in class and uh felt productive in the afternoon uh and will say during my th o'clock to o'clock class it felt like an eternity really didn't have whole lot of focus or energy in that period of time at all but after that got an work done with an classmates got dinner then kept working with an classmates went back to the dorm watched an baseball and now i'm going um to bed early um maybe to make up for an of last night sleep uh and have to get up uh little earlier tomorrow for uh baseball so uh we will see 
58,today again started with not the greatest night sleep uh woke up right around the same time in the morning at about 400 am and it took me while to fall back asleep unfortunately uh fell back to sleep uh got up in at 700 and went to uh baseball uh where we just had short little hour uh practice which was good inside uh then went to class uh class was class was good in even before class was productive got some homework that was due tomorrow done uh then uh went to went back to uh to lunch and then back to class where we had guest speaker which was uh interesting then right back to the baseball um right back across the river and just kinda chilled out in the locker room tried to get some work done but didn't really have real plan of uh getting stuff done so usually if don't have plan usually don't get any much done so uh then went to uh went to lift had good lift uh went to dinner and uh then went to office hour to get my uh problem [set] done which was there was so many people little overwhelming ha-had most of it done but only had question on the last part and had to wait for everybody which think was little uh wouldn't say short tempered but just uh impatient uh would say was im pretty impatient uh but all in all uh no complaints 
59,today today started with getting much better night sleep than the last two night uh think woke up naturally before my alarm and uh felt much better uh then got up and went to breakfast uh and between breakfast and class had some like leisure time just kind of chilled out uh which hadn't been able to do for while uh then just read little pleasure reading it was fun it was good then uh from last till from class till lunch to class um and then from class to uh big big uh uh conditioning day uh it was very tough workout and uh but there was like little challenge that we had to do uh on the bike and met it but just barely and mean it was brutal but felt so so much better afterwards even though was very very tired very sore so uh then went got back tried to get little work done uh moderately successfully and then got dinner um and i've noticed i've been uh making point to eat uh healthy very lat always ate healthy but um now really in the past week or so really uh killing it on what um i'm putting in my body and uh don't know if it physically helped me any but think mentally it makes me feel better i've noticed uh then went uh and hung out with some of the baseball guys and now time for bed 
60,this morning started up waking naturally then got some breakfast and then did some work um up until when my parents came for uh the parents weekend football tailgate um where uh we went to little bit of the game and my parents met some of my friends' parents so that was good we then went out to lunch and we just had good meal and it was great to catch up with them mean they're not that far away from home at all so it wasn't as big of deal as it was for other people uh then came back to the dorm and chatted with friend from home for while which was great to catch up with them uh and then did some more work until dinnertime ate dinner by myself [inaudible] with their parents so then came back and uh watched uh the world series by myself talking to my roommates who wasn't here tonight uh or it was out and just didn't have any motivation to go out and socialize uh didn't mind just keeping to myself tonight uh now it time for bed 
61,this morning woke up and uh felt fairly well rested went to the gym to get like little little workout in on by myself and uh felt good after uh then went to the dining hall and no exaggeration spent almost my like my the whole day there uh ate did work ate did work ate then did did practice test or unit review and then came back uh with friend and the roommates to uh watch little baseball world series which they are currently doing now and i'm in bed uh spent most of my day alone just with my my laptop and my work um will say good amount of they was doing uh some well doing the psych surveys the study surveys and then also some other uh surveys that had to do uh but other than that they was just work work and eat and that why felt like needed to uh get lift in this morning uh because knew what my always plan my day so knew what was ahead uh time for bed now 'cause have morning lift tomorrow 
62,this morning started wake [inaudible] about 645 to get to um team lift at 800 am uh felt little tired at the beginning uh th took me little bit longer than would have expected to wake up af but after that uh felt like was productive had breakfast went to class and then had lunch went to class um and then from o'clock on was free to do uh whatever so got uh work done that was uh assigned today and then have to uh have term paper due thanksgiving break so uh wrote the first page of that uh which uh feel good about uh ate dinner and after dinner really just chilled out tried to get some work done but wasn't focused at all and then just said whatever i'll just uh chill out so at the beginning of the day was uh with people then in the afternoon was just kinda by myself doing my own thing working uh then the same thing at night just kinda chilled out by myself pretty low-key uh going to bed now 'cause i'm trying to get some good quality sleep tonight uh especially since uh lifted today uh and we'll see 
63,today was good day at uh started waking up little earlier than wanted to but uh got up and got to breakfast and had some time before my first class got little bit of work done not as productive as would have liked to be but um i'll take it and class uh didn't go great but that was as it collectively as class we felt that way um so that was little frustrating but uh then went to section which was easy and for another class and then uh class afternoon class was cancelled so had the opportunity to get lunch and head down to the um locker room early where uh didn't really have the motivation to do any work uh naturally down at the athletic field at the uh locker room so uh took my time uh warming up just really lengthened everything out and uh which was uh fun then had good lift and had big dinner and then had second dinner after that uh so ate little bit more today uh was little light on the scale so uh ate little extra but still ate healthy feeling good uh and going to bed soon 
64,today started with awful night sleep uh started tracking my sleep just few days ago on an app and got well under seven hours of sleep last night like six and half hours of sleep but was in bed for eight and half hours have been getting up in the middle of the night having to go to the bathroom more and more woke up [inaudible] um didn't feel whole lot uh more tired but mean felt little bit uh was little tired during the first class then uh just not little tired during the second class uh then after my second class came back to the dorm and uh took nap which never really do but and felt like it would be beneficial and during my 300 to 500 seminar wasn't super focused but then all of sudden at like o'clock was like hit with like 430 hit with wave of energy and uh decided to like hey before dinner go to the go to the gym and ride the bike just do an core core work and just little quick little by myself and that was that was the last thing would have expected uh if asked myself this morning so the nap helped hopefully it won't um prevent me from sleeping tonight don't think it will and uh now i'm just uh chilling out with um my roommate and friend watching the world series and uh hopefully get better night sleep tonight 
65,again today started with not the greatest night sleep uh woke up uh and fin fall back asleep uh so that think impacted my energy level especially at the end of the day uh woke up went to breakfast then before my first class uh did some last-minute studying review and just had quiz and one class then to lunch then to um lecture which was easy then to practice which uh went fine um normal and then to lift which also went fine went normal was little bit more tired than usual i'd say during lift and practice uh and then to dinner then to office hours to finish problem set uh at the last minute last-minute questions so was tired during that as well so that why i'm going to bed right now and it 10 o'clock hopefully i'll be able to get good night sleep tonight 
66,today started with uh better night sleep uh but did uh wake up and felt super sore like my muscles and my back in particular which is still not fully healed um yeah super tight super sore which was unfortunate uh got up went to breakfast then went to uh class to then another um psych study then to um lecture which wasn't super engaged in but think that was more so the lecture than me then headed over to uh quick lunch and then to the to lift or to conditioning rather today um where um felt tight felt little uh not as strong little sore but um but performed fine um and then went to uh dinner or actually got little bit uh just little reading done uh and then to dinner then to the hockey game then uh after the hockey game ate big burrito which probably wasn't the most necessary but was hungry so uh and had some more food too the day uh ate good amount today uh now and didn't really have any motivation to go out and socialize tonight being on the hockey game uh so back to them dorm and uh gonna get to bed now 
67,today started waking up earlier than wanted to uh and then going back to sleep although it took me while uh think it'd be worth noting that press the button on my wristband when try to fall asleep and actually fall asleep 10 15 minutes normal um but press it in the morning after stop trying to fall asleep with that said there might be days where i'm up for over an hour trying to fall back asleep so the window of time between the button press aren't how long i'm sleeping it how long i'm trying to sleep and haven't been as good of sleeper as wanted to be but with that said today felt productive uh set an goals that knew what wanted to get done and got them done uh went to [redacted] and really just uh did as much work as could uh yeah no uh no problems there felt good and then tried to take nap later this this afternoon and just laid in bed for half an hour unsuccessfully falling asleep but think just laying there helped uh then just went over an notes on study guide for an exam tuesday uh had dinner and then uh reached out to my parents and asked if could uh it were in the city so it came and picked me up and asked if could go home in their now i'm home slee uh sleeping in my own bed think that'll be good for my sleep schedule and my back and everything just get me get me back back on track um awesome seeing them and the brother uh and yeah gonna use this time at home to catch up on good sleep and uh spend time with family and get an studying done tomorrow at home 
68,today felt great waking up in my own bed at home uh significantly more comfortable than the bed here um and as silly as it sounds think that my sleep quality in the dorm is just not comparable to what could get at home from the bed to the noise to the light to everything so felt great waking up in real bed um having uh home-cooked breakfast um was great then did little bit of work studying for midterms then went and got lunch with one of my best friends who also just happened to be home for the weekend he goes to school around here so i've seen him but uh good to get lunch with him uh just chill out talk and then got back spent some time with my dad and played catch with him uh which was pretty much the only physical activity did today then uh did more practice exams and studying uh until dinner had dinner and then uh at home and then went uh got driven back to campus where took another practice exams so lot of studying today but mixed in with time with uh my friends and family which was good just to talk to talk to the fam and just catch up with him uh early morning lift tomorrow so time for bed 
69,again today started with just okay sleep not great uh was up for at least an hour during the night unable to fall asleep but then had morning lift which think gave me an energy then um so ate before lift ate after lift then went to uh class which was fine and uh ate again and then went to an amazing um really really good lecture with guest speaker um and then that ended at o'clock uh it was good to catch up with my friend uh facetime called with him for good amount of time hadn't been able to uh talk with him recently so that was good then uh just did homework studying all afternoon and all night felt productive in the afternoon before dinner and then after dinner just really didn't wasn't as focused didn't get as much done as wanted to so we will see how that fares on the exams the next few day uh going to bed think i'm gonna try and get good amount of work done before class tomorrow 
70,today started fi um with little better night sleep uh tried sleeping in the uh common room on the futon and um get up in the middle of the night every night and definitely fell asleep faster um fell back asleep faster last night so trying it again tonight uh in the morning studied for an exam had today then um and then went to class went to class and then had the exam this afternoon think it went well we'll see um feel fine about it then went over to the locker room and uh played catch and then had team lift uh and felt good uh little sore uh in the back um but um after that got dinner and then just really didn't have much motivation to study for my exam tomorrow which definitely need to study for but i'll hopefully get an studying in tomorrow go to review session and hopefully that'll get me ready 
71,uh started waking up little bit earlier than i'd anticipated but didn't feel tired or like um needed more sleep so uh got up and uh had breakfast with friend at the dining hall and then um uh tried to get some studying done uh before class and then had class and then had lunch then had good uh review session for some exam today uh that uh needed to uh study lot for so not lot but just had some questions that got answered uh which is great um then this uh afternoon um my seminar had uh guest um visitor um uh former mlb player who uh also studied uh what the class is about uh and he was great super nice super cool to uh meet and talk with him uh connected with him right off the bat uh then we chatted for while which is great uh then after dinner had uh mid-term exam which don't think went particularly well but after talking with my peers it don't seem like anybody thought he did particularly well think everybody thought it was hard um so that made me feel better um after the exam surprisingly had lot of energy so decided to just go for jog around the block and try and get that energy out and now it is time for bed 
72,think got good night sleep last night and uh that led to uh pretty good day today um tried to get as much of my homework done before my 1100 am class started and then uh had breakfast with uh friend uh at the dining hall and after uh class had quick lunch with some of my friend and then went to interesting lecture which was great and then uh spent long time at the uh at baseball between practice and lift and then uh have noticed felt really really motivated the last few day i've been uh yeah noticeably um more motivated think i've been reading about um the life of certain person and uh just been taking lessons from that uh after had had dinner by myself um which was honestly fine just to unwind and be by myself for little bit of the day uh usually like little bit of time to myself honestly so uh that was good and then continued to do some homework uh all the way till about 1000-ish maybe 930 maybe and then uh came back here and to the dorm and now going to bed um felt felt good today especially think after the exams my um was more at ease um and that was probably just because had less work on my mind so um going to bed now for uh hopefully good day tomorrow 
73,today was good day started uh waking up at normal hour and actually had little bit of time between breakfast and class to um just um hang out and read for pleasure no stress of doing work and then went to class which was fine but it uh getting little bit harder um and then uh so that class has lot of work coming up so tried to do most of that or most of my free time today was spent doing that but it uh like said getting harder and harder so uh we will survive uh after class went to um the the locker room and had conditioning and um which was uh tough and then did lift after that don't know made me feel good felt really good uh after so then uh had meal with my friends at the dining hall hung out with them for little bit and then came back to the dorm and tried to get as much work done as could so that free time tried to get work but got little frustrated with it um and um now it time for bed 
75,today started um little later than usual since got to bed so late uh because my friends were over yesterday uh woke up didn't feel good at all um and um yeah didn't feel good at all and so that prevented me from being super productive um in like the earlier part of my day guess you could say um because if don't get my normal sleep just feel like awful so that why i'm going to bed right now um and because have to get up early tomorrow but were stressing out today over my paper that have to write and uh talked to my mom and she uh and we were just would call because um not for that but then we ended up talking about that and she helped me guess just talking don't know and uh so that um were the majority of my day spent working on this paper um and that really it no physical exercise no anything just um just just working on that really spent lot of time alone um in library today um tomorrow we have morning lift so time for bed now 
76,today started early with team lift at 800 am got to bed early last night and uh woke up and felt like got enough sleep um uh had fine lift and then um rushed to uh rushed to class uh which was um not ideal but um not problem then and then ate lunch and then went to class after that um after that ate again and um then my mother came to pick me up and took me to the uh doctor which got some good news about the progress of my uh back injury and uh what can and can't do going forward and hopefully timetable for that which uh was great news um got some good news about um uh just something at home which was great um and then had nice dinner with my mom little celebration uh which was um which was awesome uh looking back ate lot today but feel good about it after working out felt like uh could eat and when did and felt felt like ate healthy which mentally just always makes me feel good um had um good breakfast and i'd say two lunch and then uh snacks and big dinner then um big snacks later so um regardless um in the uh like dead time that did have um cranked out as much work as could um and was actually fairly productive in the time that spent doing work which made me feel good um time for bed now 
77,today started getting up after what think it was good night sleep felt well-rested and uh got little bit of work done before classes which was good which think i'll plan on doing tomorrow um i've figured out that my mornings are when i'm most productive um as opposed to what most people get done during night just can't do so tomorrow mornings hopefully i'll get something done i'm working on this big paper and it taking up way more time than had anticipated so um that really the only thing that been causing me any distress um that on top of um math exam thursday which uh [inaudible] won't be particularly easy guess doesn't help so hmm that what on my mind uh preparing for that and uh lot of classes tomorrow but um no baseball so that means i'll use any and all dead time have to uh get work done and either write or study um good amount of my day was spent uh by myself with my computer just study uh writing it research paper so it more research than writing to be honest which doesn't particularly like so that just kinda been sucking for the last week and it due in week so time for bed we'll see 
78,today was good productive workday uh set my alarm purposefully little bit earlier to get um some writing done before my first class which uh started at 1000 today so got um some good amount of well got some writing in and then uh went to class um and then to lunch then to class um uh then had little bit of time in between class and my seminar to get some work done uh just little bit and then uh the seminar went well uh the seminar went better than my other two class so just was um mean they went fine but [not yet] average but the seminar went well felt good about that then was productive and did practice exam before dinner ate dinner and then after studied the practice exam uh and then went to uh little meeting with my entryway uh and just chatted about some things and now time for bed um overall most of my day was spent by myself um doing work and was thinking about they and think that feel fine about that um as much as like people and like my friends when don't have problem being alone you know just by myself doing work or not doing work 
79,today started uh nice and early woke up at like so well before 630 before my alarm and uh then uh ate little thing in the dorm and headed off to uh across the river to uh baseball where just had nice easy practice um and then went back to uh breakfast and after breakfast and then this is all before my 1100 am so felt productive uh which was felt which was good and then uh had lunch and then went to lecture where um which was easy really uh low key and then headed back over across the river to my workout which was good um felt normal uh not weak not strong just normal which is good uh then came back and ate dinner before an exam um which was difficult so was little bit disappointed with myself uh after that exam um most people thought it was difficult so it puts it in perspective uh but yeah that was unfortunate and that kind of took all the energy out of me to be honest tried to get little work done afterwards but uh with no real success so um pretty lazy night um and going to bed now 
81,today wa woke up in um hotel room bed um not had ton of hours of sleep but um felt like the sleep got wa good um had uh had breakfast then um went to the [inaudible] game where there wa big tailgate before interacted with lot of people wa uh fairly social and uh yeah met some new uh met some new faces saw lot of people which wa fun lot of fun uh before the game and went to the game which wa uh not as not as good we um the team didn't do well it wasn't great game but um it wa good to hang out with some friends at the game uh after the game we uh we figured out we had to uh get on shuttle back to uh back to campus so that wa long bus ride but not too bad uh spent lot of just listened to podcast and just kind of chilled out and that wa good didn't sleep but definitely just chilled out um think it wa good for my mind the long the long trip uh then uh hung out in the room with roommate and now it time for bed 
82,today was productive day uh got an okay night sleep woke up at 300 am to my roommate snoring and so had to go out to the common room and sleep which sucks and that uh but that didn't affect my productivity today woke up and got lot of work done before lunchtime and um then after lunch finished up my term paper which felt great to get done so two assignments before lunchtime was the goal and knocked that out and the big writing assignments after lunch was the goal to finish and finished well before dinner and had time to hang out with an friends uh after dinner and now going to bed

90,today started getting up early for team workout at 800 am so woke up at like 630 uh got an okay night sleep not perfect um my roommate snores and wakes me up so my sleep is not ideal uh but uh had fine lift and then went to class and uh felt fine in class felt good in class had lunch then the class then went back to the uh back to base back across the river uh and did an uh rehab uh work with the trainer and played catch uh which felt good then in the af after that came uh went to str maybe had snack and then went straight to the library or the science center and uh really uh banged out an work that needed to get done didn't need to get done it due wednesday but wanted to get done uh so was really focused on that felt good about that and then uh got dinner and then post-dinner uh was um had good plan to study but um and did it but it just took lot longer than anticipated uh uh not lot longer but no wasn't as productive as could have been in this in the time but um it is what it is and i'm not stressed about it at all no worries um was just trying to get ahead with an studying and uh yeah but overall uh lot of uh baseball before and after class which always like uh and uh hopefully good day tomorrow 
91,overall felt like today was fairly productive with my time uh like to make list of things need to get done and got those one of those things of the checklist done um but i'd say beyond those and got doing extra stuff have noticed i'm not as motivated to do it if don't write it down as let say like goal for the day or put it down on my to-do list so maybe that'll be something work on uh felt um spent most of my day um the afternoon anyway uh over with at baseball uh interacting with other people felt um felt good felt um like there was just like positive energy as team which think translated to everybody individually and myself included so felt good about those and academically studied this morning and then took like quiz felt strong about those and then uh after baseball did an-another [inaudible] session and felt good about those so overall felt uh good about my day academically probably could have gotten little bit more work done so looks like i'll do those tomorrow morning 
92,today started with what thought was all right-length sleep but uh ended up pretty tired during the day so took nap which usually don't do but took nap around oh think 200 and uh think felt better after um overall had good amount of class today um and was focused in class and uh felt good in class uh and then after um excuse me after dinner tried to uh get ahead on some homework and got the easy stuff done no problem and then once hit some more difficult problem just didn't have much motivation at all um the homework due friday so guess i'm doing that tomorrow evening um yeah but uh even with that not very uh stressful of day uh any day you can get get nap in is is good day um oh before class did get some uh other homework done so did feel productive got what needed to get done um but uh yeah going to sleep now 
93,today today was good day uh lot of time spent over across the river uh doing uh baseball stuff which always like uh just love love being over there um whether it in the training room or working out or playing catch um lo love being over there and was went over before classes started at 1100 and um while was over there um got some goo-good work in and then went to classes and then tried to get as much homework done as could between classes um and between my classes then another classes and went right back over to the field um or to the athletics facility um tried to get little bit more work done finished homework assignment and then um and that was kind of stressful to get that done it was pretty hard and knew wouldn't have time because after throwing and having meetings uh baseball meetings and then lifting had office hours which had to do pset and um and then entryway meetings so little stressful in terms of there was no real downtime today but was fairly productive and uh only have little bit more work to do tomorrow morning 
94,today started with just an okay night sleep um woke up early and uh tried to get few more hours but couldn't um at least don't think uh was super tired this morning um got up went to breakfast had to finish an homework before class started so got that done and then went to class and was very tired don't know it obviously was just from the sleep or lack of sleep um but still think uh don't know uh then had lunch with professor which was uh fun and with few other students and uh then ran to the next class which went fine and uh that was my last class of the semester so after that uh went to the field or went to the baseball uh locker room and uh got good workout in and after the workout got another uh so the workout was got an more workout in which was good was determined to get it done felt good enough to get it done and wasn't tired and so went for it and felt good after um then had big dinner um and then after dinner was fairly tired um chatted with the folks which was nice to touch base with them hadn't in while and then uh went and hang out with the baseball team for little and now going to bed 
95,today started with um uh not great night sleep uh my roommate woke me up in the middle of the night again and uh took while had to go back out to the common room to fall back asleep so sleeping on the futon wasn't ideal um so um was fairly little bit tired um especially in the afternoon so took nap uh and that definitely helped me just like quick 30-minute nap and uh felt better after which was got my energy back up um but today is first day of reading week so spent lot of time planning out the week how i'm gonna study uh little overwhelmed in the amount of time and uh amount of studying to do um it just lot of both lot of time but also lot of stuff to do so it'll be interesting uh tried to get uh have one little writing assignment so started that and uh yeah and in the after the nap had energy went across the river and played catch and worked out and uh noticed that when i'm the that when i'm the happiest is uh playing baseball and working out um all the stress uh kinda go away or whatever whatever on my mind uh talked with the folks today it helped me figure out how i'm gonna rectify my uh sleeping with the roommate and uh yeah so that was my day 
96,today started with think really good night sleep um both of my roommates didn't sleep in the dorm so had the room to myself and think that really helped my sleep quality um without doubt um uh was productive today had goal to get three things done and got that three things done and uh made me feel good um in the morning uh got practice test done in the afternoon finished paper and then after dinner did um homework assignment so all in all felt productive um the practice test and the paper was by myself and then the homework was with group of friends uh in the afternoon before dinner went and took long walk to um just to book store didn't get anything but kn-knew wanted to get walk in today so that was my activity for the day and i'm gonna lift tomorrow morning so uh all in all felt good 
97,today started with another not great night sleep uh was up from 200 am to 300 am because of my roommate snoring had to move to the common room to sleep on the futon not great night sleep got up early to work out and uh and then play catch um which went well but after that just had like no energy um so at like 1230 tried to take nap wasn't successful so uh but think just relaxing helped my energy level uh [inaudible] so finally um think we uh we am trying different uh setup sleeping arrangement uh hopefully it'll be better i'll be able to sleep through the night for the first time in while so knock on wood with that and so in the morning was okay um and then after that it little uh little bit irritable um it definitely tired and so needed that time to rest um after my uh resting and lunch felt better and got uh some practice um studying in for final and then had dinner and then started study guide for another exam after dinner so ended up getting some work done despite the lack of sleep so hopefully won't have that ch-challenge tomorrow 
98,uh today started with good night sleep um finally uh what think was an uninterrupted night sleep which was um because of the we changed the sleeping uh situation and it worked so knock on wood all good night sleep tonight um but could tell like it boosted my energy felt uh more productive didn't need nap in the middle of the day just little stuff like that my mood was better um so think the sleep is key um then did lot of school work or did an uh studying today um after breakfast before lunch and then tried to get an more done after lunch um and before my workout but um yo mean had an easy two two and half hours but just wasn't as productive as would've liked to have been so uh hopefully will be will be better tomorrow um yeah post dinner uh could've been little bit more productive but uh reached out to an old friends and uh talked with them so think that that was valuable um yeah that was good catching up with them um all in all uh felt like good day 
99,today started with another good night sleep uh felt like had plenty of energy to get everything wanted to get done today um that included uh practice exam in the morning uh lunch then went down to the uh field and played catch did my training room exercises and rode the exercises bike uh for good sweat uh then came back and uh got another practice exam done um ate dinner and then went right back to the library and finished up some studying um i'd say my ability to focus was uh really good uh my time during the practice exam and studying was all by myself but it was good right in the middle of the day to have to have some time uh with two of my friends who went down together to the field uh so think i'll have the same schedule tomorrow really uh really worked well for me from workload-wise and from uh uh interacting with people having fun uh so that it 
100,today started with not as good night sleep at the past few night uh woke up think two times in the middle of the night so not ideal but um um got my practice test done before lunch after breakfast and it took me little bit longer than it may usually would have um then after lunch headed over to the field where uh did my uh the whole training room work and the workout and uh felt pretty good uh then came back and had an early dinner and tried to get an extra studying in before my office hours um wasn't as productive as would have liked to have been my energy was think drained after the workout and uh yeah in office hours was moderately focused um there was just few of me and the tf asking an questions um so overall think could have been little bit more productive uh studying-wise today but we'll uh i'll try to be better tomorrow 
101,today started with pretty good night sleep i'd say um woke up and woke up before my alarm uh did um did little meditation did uh breakfast then tried to get some work done um before um some office hours for math then uh tried to squeeze little bit more work in before lunch um so got some stuff done not like uber uber productive but got some work done and after lunch went and uh went to the field played catch uh did my physical therapy did my workout and uh felt pretty good uh to be honest uh came back got dinner and then was really tired really really physically and mentally drained uh but uh tried to get little bit more note-taking studying done uh then kind of eased uh into the night just uh really doing nothing just hanging in the room um hopef-hopefully gonna have productive tomorrow
