like program want to do and was really nervous about it but kind of hyped myself up beforehand and um prepared quite bit so was confident going into it and think it went well so after left was happy and um yeah kind of nerve-wracking leading up to it but part of me knew would do well and think did do well hopefully but regardless i've i'm happy that did it and think probably um you know gained something from it regardless of whether or not get into it um had like the meeting to get my wristband on today for this study it was good um pretty straightforward not really many like emotions that come from that um so yeah just kind of getting into the groove of the school year like still adjusting um there not really much stress coming from like my roommates or anything like that um they're both pretty good um um i'm not sure there there not much not much stress right now other than academic stress i'm worried that i'm like falling behind and procrastinate quite bit which is something did in high school and um was hoping to drop that for college but it like it hard habit to break guess just worried that i'm falling behind little bit um but i'm trying to get it get it all together studied quite bit today more than usual so hopefully i'm starting new trend there just lot to keep on top of and it overwhelming feel overwhelmed but it'll all be good and um yeah that about it i'm i'm uh pretty positive today so so it my second day with the wristband um feel like slept pretty well last night better than usual um like maybe like seven hours seven to seven and half hours it was pretty good um it was long day had lot of classes and that kinda stressed me out don't know i'm just falling behind in my classes and there things that need to be doing that i'm not doing um like 'cause i'm not sure how necessary it are so it just stressful and should probably do it but at this point it like too late for some of it but it like don't know i'm doing fine um and it just the beginning of the semester was in uh i'd say some okay mood today was kind of irritable i've been noticing like increasingly lately i've been quite irritable and um just like negative and really need to stop that because it like it hinders my um it just hinders me um and so i'm gonna try to be more positive in the future and like tomorrow 'cause i've just been in like shitty attitude and don't know why um and yes i'm just gonna study little bit more tonight had um didn't do much today other than go to classes we just had like uh some orientation event um lot like mental health and stuff that we had to to for like two hours so did that and now i'm just gonna study like nothing that major um that it so had pretty good day today um it was unusually stressful at times um in the morning had last night had decided that wanted to switch one of my classes um and switch into another classes it was very last minute um few weeks into the semester so it was stressful getting that all figured out and having to get the professor to approve that and now in the future have to catch up like in the next few day and so i'm stressed out about that having to catch up like for what i've missed in the last three weeks in that new classes but also relieved because switched out of my first classes for region for reason um and am relieved that i'm out of that but also stressed about making up what missed in my new classes um uh also had kind of an exciting few hours today found out that i'd gotten to program that had comped for few day ago um that could ha had had an interview for few day ago and found out that was accepted to the program um and guess like it didn't accept many people and so was very excited to be one of the people that was accepted and um yeah very excited about that so that was cool um i'm looking forward to my meeting about that on um saturday and uh yeah i've been studying quite bit well not quite bit honestly i've been studying little bit and been procrastinating quite bit um social interactions was generally very good today had um quite few people um i'm worried that i'm not meeting enough new people and that just have like my group of friends that have now and that need to be working on forming new relationships with more people so that about it okay so slept okay last night probably for like um like about eight hours it it was it was good and woke up today and spent most of the day um or big chunk of it at least working cleaning bathrooms um on campus for my job so that was um that was big part of my day it kind of tiring um was doing it um think it uh in in in team guess or like in pair with someone else and we're cleaning the same bathrooms at the same time so was talking to him throughout it it was cool um studied lot today still stressed about catching up in one of my classes um but was was pretty productive was good at like coming up with plan and sticking to it i'm still studying little bit right now go to bed in like an hours or so an hours or two um was wasn't very anxious today feel good and i'm looking forward to tomorrow um me and my roommates are gonna go do an things um in [redacted] we're going to go canoeing which would be fun um yeah pretty mellow day overall uh so slept pretty well last night got about seven hours um and woke up naturally and was going to go to work today um just like doing some inspections for my my on-campus job um and was gonna do that for like two hours but got really um just didn't wanna do it went after like some hours and stopped stopped that early was kind of anxious because the job involves like kind of pushing on people doors and bothering people and like uh don't know just didn't like it so was like anxious and like stressed out and just was just wanted to leave so did um and then went ca um canoeing with my roommates today and another guy and it was fun but um just had so much stuff to do like school-wise that couldn't enjoy it and it was was just very worried about like the whole don't know just felt like was coming off kind of weird all day because was so distracted or like my head was just in the wrong place or whatever so was worried about how like it was perceiving me today and whatever um then came back and studied for little bit um actually i've studied quite bit and i'm still studying right now am still trying to catch up on my classes it like have so much stuff to do um so i'm trying to do all that and it very stressful um had dinner with some friends that was fun the same group of people that usually have meals with um it was uh good day but stressful day and tomorrow is gonna be very very stressful so i'm not looking forward to it don't know how long how late i'm gonna stay up tonight but um ugh it yeah so have lot of work to do tonight and tomorrow so that about it so had um kind of stressful day today have class tomorrow that need to um get caught up in but it gotten to point where it impossible for me to complete all the work that need to complete by tomorrow and i'm still procrastinating um and it like there is just so much work to do i'm not doing any work which is very bad um plan of action but that what happening and i'm nervous about what gonna happen tomorrow so very very stressed about going to class tomorrow and ho i'm just gonna stay up for few more hours and read about um and read what need to read [inaudible] do do something and hope for the best um yeah so i'm not looking forward to that stressed out about that i've spent most of the day studying or good portion of it um other than that today wasn't too eventful had some meetings just for like clubs and stuff that i'm doing um which were fine little bit nervous for one of them but only very slightly and it were it were it were fine um got good night sleep uh no okay night sleep um yeah so i'm just very stressed about the class and i'm waiting you know very anxious for it to be over um so today was uh it was pretty good day not super um uh didn't really work very hard throughout the day um on anything but had was very nervous about my class in the morning had ton of homework to do for the class to make up for and didn't finish all of it in time and was worried that would it would be very obvious that wasn't able to do all of the work and that would fall behind and make bad first pre impression um but actually it went fine and was able to keep up with the conversation and contribute things and um it it really didn't need to do all the work to be able to to keep up in the class which was good so um that went that was fine um and after that had another class it went fine um and then um had to do like little writing prompt which procrastinated quite bit on um i've been think i'm getting little bit better and not procrastinating as school picks up but it still something that causes me lot of stress and still something that do lot of um i'm just very susceptible to like getting distracted by the internet and things like that um and then uh had dinner with like 12 people um because it my roommate birthday and so we went out to restaurant with him and and like said quite few people and that was fun met some new people um saw lot of people already knew it was fine it was cool it was very like low-key it was nice um and then got back and thought about studying little bit but decided to go to bed instead um so tomorrow have very busy day um class and lot of studying so i'm little bit stressed out about that um yeah so that probably my major source of stress there some like social stuff that don't know i'm just uh [inaudible] i'm um hoping that i'm trying to just make sure that maintain all the friendships that i've created and that can be stressful um but uh it it good it good um and that about it so slept very well last night um think got like 10 hours of sleep little bit less like hours maybe um so slept very well um woke up at woke up pretty late um ate rel well relatively healthy today up until tonight when had lot of junk food um today was um was just kind of uh something had happened at lunch that just kind of threw me off and irritated me and pissed me off little bit and um just made me upset and so that kind of threw off my day little bit but um had dinner with friends which was cool and um so that kind of like lifted me up again and then um you know throughout the day studied little bit think i'm getting better at organization and planning ahead um and yeah so studied little bit for my classes wasn't too stressful today today went to switched into new classes and today was the first day of lecture that was going to attend and um so went to the lecture hall and there was no one there and guess the location of the classes had been changed without anyone telling me so that was stressful um and just kind of it was something didn't want to have to deal with and didn't expect to but it was all you know it was fine it was good day i'm gonna study little bit more and then go to sleep so had um good night rest last night and uh had uh um just you know went to classes that was fine um but had kind of realization today in one of my classes that don't want to be behind anymore and don't wanna like be in classes where most people seem to know what they're talking about when haven't done the work which has be-been um kinda the boat that i've been in recently and think would be able to scoot by pretty well if didn't do all the work was supposed to do but decided that at least for the next week wanna do everything that i'm supposed to do read every word watch everything study as uh much as need to like do everything that the teacher want me to do um and just do really get on top of things it important to start strong and need to get on top of lot of things so today went to the library today to study for really haven't gotten um haven't gotten to the library many times before here so it was for one of the first times and was very productive got lot done got just about all that needed to get done done which was great um worked on getting on top of things read an entire book it was um very productive so uh and uh as opposed to being in my dorm room which has been where i've been studying prior to today and that haven't worked out very well and i've been distracted easily and procrastinate so think the trick is just to go to the library which is what i'll start doing um little stressed out today about an social stuff but we'll see how that all pans out um and that about it so slept okay last night um got like about seven or eight hours believe maybe bit more um but which thought was fine um and um had some classes today uh was little worried about some of them because had sections where was expected to participate quite bit and although was prepared was just worried about that won't be able to keep up or something so i'm little stressed about that and worried um uh other than that not much stress academically i've procrastinated little bit today but none of the work have to do is all that pressing um and kind of have problem where don't start work until the last possible minute and usually get things done um but even now that i've decided to be like more efficient and productive and to get done what need to get done find myself waiting until the last minute so need to stop that um and just kind of figure out way to so don't know just stop waiting till the last minute so that um what i'm worrying about today so spent five hours today working um in my on-campus job cleaning bathrooms um and did that with friend for most of the time so it was kind of social thing in addition to work which is nice and then um came back and worked for little bit i've been working pretty efficiently i've been definitely procrastinating quite bit less um and working on getting on top of thing have just lot of stuff coming up which i'm stressed about um but uh i'm getting thing together um have not well tomorrow have training for an extracurricular i'm doing which i'm kinda nervous about um even though know i'll do well but i'm just nervous about starting new thing so i'm stressed about that and then actually have to start the the new thing like officially um it like teaching program so i'm gonna start teaching on monday um which is stressful but kind of exciting and cool opportunity to continue something really enjoy so i'm looking forward to that also kind of anxious about it but uh hopefully it would go well i'm positive about it so just um quite stressed today because um just have so much work to do and it piling up and even though am doing pretty good job of keeping on top of things just have so much work to do and feel like uh have to put in twice as much time to be like half as productive as some of my classmates and like half as put together there people here that am just able to that am so much more efficient and think my academic background like my high school didn't prepare me as well as other people have for uh this school and um so it just stressful to feel like i'm always gonna be behind and that causing like stress and anxiety um which is what i'm worrying about now when i'm just working hard to to get on top of things uh um and it not gonna happen i'm not gonna ever be able to be on top of things and it just kind of really bad feeling um uh uh uh my time management have gotten better but still i'm just very stressed by academic and some special stuff but mostly academic that where the priority is that what i'm focusing on and that what i'm stressed about so had pretty productive uh pretty good day today um had quite bit of work to do um but was pretty good about getting it all done procrastinated little but do think i'm getting better um and um yeah so uh my my classes are are difficult but as i've kind of suspected the more time spend in them the the easier it are or not the easier but the more manageable it are and still have lot of catching up to do and lot of work to do and the work are never gonna subside but um i'm learning slightly slightly more about how to deal with all of it just so slightly uh but it good it in the right direction um and tomorrow have uh i'm gonna go in and teach some kids um about civics through one of the programs here um at the 8th-grade level and i'm feel little bit unprepared but i'm gonna have like some hour tomorrow i'm gonna go over the curriculum and um i'm excited but kind of nervous it all about perspective though so i'm just trying to be positive about it and it something want to do like i'm looking forward to it um and we'll see how it go um and yeah that about it good day overall socially as well so had pretty eventful day today um started my teaching with local um uh middle school which is an extracurricular i'm doing here so went and for an hour today to their class and taught them an stuff was kind of stressed out before but when got there and afterward it was fine don't think it went very well like for several reasons but not really anything that was my fault or in my control um and it was fine um you know whatever so have kind of neutral thoughts on that and um you know after that studied for little bit procrastinated little but think i'm getting better um and had another little meeting for one of my extracurricular um which was very low-key had um you know like said very jampacked day but it wasn't as stressful as thoughts it was going to be um it was it was fine overall slept well last night um and not much coming up um extracurricularly speaking but academics um is definitely piling up and i'm you know need to keep on top of it so that what i'm focusing on now or at least thinking about focusing on so had pretty good day today would say um semi semi stressful um at times but it was it was good overall um went to classes studied little bit i'm still having issues with procrastination but i've uh documented those struggles plenty of times before so basically the same thing um still procrastinate too much but feel i'm getting better getting on top of thing um have noticed those if work isn't urgent as in it due the next day or the day of usually don't do it even though want to do it so it maybe something should change and um kind of excited right now 'cause just found out got um tickets to an event those really wanted to go to um so those cool and yeah excited about those looking forward to those event which is on thursday um with like yeah political figure so it should be cool to go to those um and yeah it was ex it uh exciting and it was good day would say so another pretty uneventful day today one thing i've been noticing is that um my diet is getting progressively worse which is big problem obviously well it not big problem not to be dramatic but like it problem so i'm going to try to like eat slightly less and healthy eat less sugar maybe don't wanna gain 15 pounds uh freshman year um and yeah had classes today i'm little anxious for some of them just like participating in classes can always be nerve-racking but um that was it was fine um am don't know i've just been in was uh kind of irritable today um little bit like towards the end of the day um and just like bad personal like bad attitude um and i've been noticing that i've i've like lately i've just been wanting to be around other people less um it seems like and uh li um that that not good thing don't know i've just i've desired social interactions less 'cause it just like just wanna like don't know i'm getting sick of being here little bit it not big problem and i'm sure it just like my attitude tonight but just feel like i'm kinda sick of being here and i'm sick of being around the people i'm around especially um my roommates 'cause but they're the nicest people so know it it definitely me it not them like i'm the one with the have the problem ga um so shouldn't don't know i'm just getting kind of irritated by being around the same people all the time and just like even even the people in my classes it just like it getting so monotonous and repetitive and it just people just annoy me like don't wanna be around them and it and fixate on them and that causes me don't know don't know it just annoying to me and it like pisses me off and it shouldn't but pe some people just do and um like that think contributing to me having bad attitude and being kinda negative so need to fix that and just like ge-get them outa my mind um so um i'd slept horribly last not horri well not didn't didn't sleep horribly 'cause got enough got like seven hours but was so tired throughout today throughout the day like right from when woke up was exhausted and like could barely get through my first classes without falling asleep and then like uh was yeah had to have had cup of coffee which helped little bit but had like lot of academic stuff to do today um and it was so hard to get through it 'cause was just so tired don't know why 'cause haven't been exhausted lately at all like since coming to college i've been pretty good but it just it all hit me today and uh don't know yeah i'm not sure 'cause did get enough sleep but don't so need to worry about sleeping more and like looking in my schedule making sure get eight hours and so i'll try to do that tonight so had pretty busy day today um but nothing like that unmanageable um slept good last night um got like got eight hours or so what needed to get um i've been feeling kind of sick lately but today felt fine which is good um and just went to some classes um not much to say about that it was kind of i've always got kind of nervous before section [inaudible] of my classes because um just feel like i'm not prepared and like everyone else is much more um knowledgeable and it know what they're talking about lot more than me and it just have background to the subject that don't have at all so they're like able to talk about things that just can't um and really shouldn't be able to like uh in terms of the context of the of the course it not things that we have learned it just prior knowledge that it know so that kind of stresses me out like don't know being automatically behind um and then went to um uh very prominent government figure who came to talk today um at the school and was lucky enough to be able to get into that get ticket to that um and so went to that and that was it was super interesting it was it was very um controversial and there was people protesting in the building um i've never been to anything like it it was just really cool and it um just like reminded me why made the right choice to come to this school um so that was really very interesting and something i'll think about for long time um it was just really cool it was kind of um just wild to be there there was so much happening um and came back to my room and just kind of you know didn't do much and i'll be going to bed since had long long day but um pretty good one so um had like pretty full day spent like three or four hours um working my on-campus job which is cleaning bathrooms um and did that with friend of mine um and always enjoy doing that just 'cause um it nice to talk to him and um it was it was good very low key um yeah always like doing that don't mind it really um and then went back to my room for while um okay just was on the computer for while and then had dinner with some people for um another extracurricular thing which is writing for the school newspaper um so had like meeting with people about that um and tomorrow have to go interview some people for story i'm writing um which is the first time i'll be doing that so don't know i'm not really nervous but it just like lot to think about and lot to plan and so guess i'm nervous about like the planning for it um but it should be good um and it was nice to to meet to meet other people i'm writing the story with that was cool and then came back to my dorm and um just like kind of went on the computer for while didn't do any homework today or any studying probably should have but should be good um i'll i'll do quite bit tomorrow um hopefully and uh that about it so had another pretty busy day today um slept well last night um today had to do some interviews for story i'm writing for the school newspaper um which was which was had three interviews and that was it was good it was my first time interviewing people so was kind of nervous but it was good experience and um there was good interactions um and th-then studied for little bit um but keep you know keep finding that am not able to really study until the very last minute on things and so like if it isn't last minute i'm have hard time concentrating so that something have to figure out um tomorrow have um have to finish writing in the paper th-the other story that i'm writing with some people which uh should be uh uh should be good um should be some interesting few hours and lot of work to do so i'm not looking forward to all of that um but that about it so had another pretty busy day today um um uh like worked just little bit more on wr-writing the article that i'm gonna that um was published today um but this it was published later in the night and uh worked on it early in the morning and like through the afternoon and so that was what spent most of my day on so worked little bit on that independently and then met up with group of people to go over my work and to see what it had done and and like talk about it and stuff like that and then later it got edited and published on the website um uh which is read by quite few people and it'll be published in print tomorrow which is exciting so happy about that um it cool that it all you know finally come together which is cool um and so i'm excited for the future and to write more article about that and was able to meet lot of new people through the process which was cool and will be able to meet lot of new people um and uh yeah pretty good day procrastinated and didn't do much homework i'm actually behind at this point but i'll try to catch up uh eventually so today was kind of an exciting day because got my article my first article published in the school newspaper um so just seeing that come together was exciting and then went to teach um an 8th-grade class on civics which is what i'll be doing once week for one hour for the rest of the semester potentially the rest of the year um and was kind of stressed out before that because don't know i'm just having hard time connecting with them and they was totally not interested in listening so they kind of frustrating and i'm like yeah don't know never really know don't enjoy doing they but it'll be good for like future stuff suppose [inaudible] in the past i've really loved this type of stuff they what i've done in high school did ton of like teaching and like tutoring sort of stuff um so guess just have to get the hang of they and get back into the group and i'll i'll like rediscover my passion for they um and then had like another meeting for the school newspaper i'm getting stressed because like my extracurricular requirements is really piling up and like they're getting the time cons the they the time commitment is starting to conflict with like academics which is um concerning and something academics is of course more important than extracurricular but find myself putting off academics for extracurricular requirements so have to figure that out um and then yeah so i'll we'll have to see about that so today got off to like not great start because uh slept through one of my lectures intentionally just [laughter] just skipped the class completely so that could sleep because was super tired but ended up getting good amount of sleep which was good um and need to just make sure start going to le to lectures 'cause missed one monday and i've been really good about going to them up until now um and was saying yesterday like my extracurricular requirements was starting to get in the way of school which is not good and just have to be careful not to put more on my plate feel pressured to like join million things and wanna join ton of stuff but just don't have the time right now so i'll just have to wait and focus on academics um uh was writing another story today and have to like go up to people and interview them just randomly um and don't know some of them was like very weird about not wanting to be interviewed and they so they was like rejecting the interview but get like so like upset by they 'cause felt like people was really rejecting wanting to talk to me they was like really they was kind of um don't know they was weird my reaction to they when people would be like oh no don't wanna talk about they um would get like sad and like feel like they was like just saying they didn't wanna talk to me 'cause they don't like me or whatever they was weird don't know and think about that lot and that kinda like put me in bad mood like sad mood for while which is weird to say but whatever and um uh studied or tried to get lot of work done we have super busy day tomorrow so i'm like not looking forward to that having to do more uh school stuff like ton of school stuff and then lot of this um news reporting stuff uh that gonna be long day and am looking forward to for they to be over need to get back on top of things that what i'm worried about um at this point so had pretty busy day today um had lunch with like an upperclassman that um uh she called like peer advising fellow she uh an uh lunch-breakfast so she like um an upperclassman meant to help freshmen which was cool it was nice to see her um and then um had class and spent another um pretty big chunk of my day trying to interview people for like another story i'm running for the school newspaper with someone else um and it was just so difficult to find someone and there was like lot of rejection so was rejected lot today and it don't know that help build build thick skin um and then got story published uh that story eventually we managed to put it together um so that was exciting um tomorrow have busy day so i'm gonna try to get as much sleep as possible and um i'm worried i'm falling behind in in class and i'm not like need to start caring so so um last night like really didn't go as planned and well guess early this morning should say um clicked the button to indicate that was going to sleep um which planned on doing and then ended up seeing um like right before went to sleep ran to the bathroom and when turned on the light ended up seeing cockroach in my room and totally freaked out um went and slept like in in another area in my in my dorm room and spent all day today cleaning my room um like organizing everything like washing everything um throwing away every little bit of trash um hoping don't have to deal with that problem again it caused me ton of anxiety just uh yeah have like the biggest fear of of insects like that it just was like flipping out um and so didn't end up going to sleep last night until like maybe some time around uh 430 maybe um and got up about well about maybe four hours later three or four hours didn't get much sleep and um slept like on hard surface and it wasn't meant to be bed it was like sh it was uh very bad night um and so yeah spent all of today like basically just running around town finding different things that needed to like you know get my dorm together and it was felt like seeing that bug was wake-up call to like get things cleaner um around here and to organize and to like live more disciplined and live um in more disciplined way um it just creeps me out and it really kind of terrifies me just hate it hate there nothing more hate more than bug like that um so that was really stressful and uh ordered some um stuff off the internet to kill them that'll get here hopefully um at some point tomorrow um but that was basically what did all day had section also for one of my classes which was like you know nothing really to say about that and then had dinner with my roommate and my friend which was nice but um was just exhausted all day long by the uh the the the lack of sleep last night so oh gosh we'll see what happens so um didn't do much today slept lot last night mean slept for like maybe like like nine hours nine or nine and half hours 'cause [inaudible] the night before last night had had really bad night sleep um and so just today didn't really didn't do too much didn't really do any homework or anything um studied um well no didn't study [or other] and just worked little bit on my on-campus job um and did that with partner and it always nice doing it with him always like don't know can't tell whether he like enjoys me guess uh my company or not and just feel feel like i'm kind of weird around him which don't like yeah do feel like i'm weird around him and don't know and then um came back from that at like 400 um had dinner with my roommate which was fine and um basically went on my computer for while not very productive day um but i'll have to get lot of work done tomorrow so had pretty um laid-back day today um woke up pretty late slept late but slept well which was good um had lunch with my friend uh one thing i'm worrying about is that have few very um had few have few good friend but i'm worried that my social group isn't large enough and need to meet norm new people and make more friend so that something i'm gonna really think about doing um i'm feeling kind of sick have think cold or something um and uh kind of was lazy today didn't do much worked for two hours um but other than that and then had dinner with the same friend um and so just wanna kinda branch out more um to meet new people and uh not very stressful day either so really uneventful day today i'm feeling little sick so like don't know it uh just something that happening took long walk which was nice i'm trying to be more fit um had lunch with my roommate and some friends which was nice and then just basically studied or you know was on the internet for the rest of the day didn't do too much um have to catch up with some of my classes um don't have any midterms which is good but i'm still worried about i'm glad don't have any midterms in the near future and i'm just worried about like testing and all that stuff and uh worrying more and more about like what my major is gonna be what wanna do so and then also worrying about like my friendships and uh you know should don't think have should have more friends than should uh like don't know yeah have the thought that most people here have more friends than me which sucks but guess that probably pretty common thought um so maybe i'll try to branch out little bit more so another pretty uneventful day slept really bad last night um and then woke up and i've been pretty physically active lately um and not eating as much as usually eat i'm trying to lose some weight um and just like be more healthy guess just really tired i'm very tired towards the end of the day um like i've had school off for three day which has been nice but i'm ready to get back into things um i'm just worried about school work and getting on top of things and some mid midterm that has coming up causing me some stress and also has uh feel like the friend group that was in at one point is like falling apart and like uh don't know just the stress of that wish didn't has to deal with but um i'm gonna has to i'm gonna has to make some new friend which is

whatever was wanna eat less just to see if can guess uh it kinda weird don't know so had another uneventful day today um slept for like an adequate amount of time last night but was extremely tired all day long so don't know why like one one and have low cold too so that might be part of it but like one of the most tired i've ever been so don't know what it is maybe don't know just don't know and um haven't been under all that much stress but do have an midterms coming up need to study for um socially today not much happened was kind of reclusive uh just like you know working on stuff and

today slept very poorly last night but i'm up late today so don't know uh just during the day felt very tired but at night i'm fine so maybe i'm becoming no-nocturnal or something um i've been kind of eating less lately and exercising more but kind of stopped that today just eating unhealthy again decided i'd rather like be little bit unhealthy and eat food that is good and that i'm passionate about rather than like nasty like salad or whatever and like be healthy like know would just rather have good food you know what mean and so um there that and uh oh like met with some people for one of my extracurriculars today which was nice um he was nice guy yeah it was it was you know uh it was good day overall and just have lot of stuff to catch up on so i'm worried about that so today was very calm laidback day didn't have class today or anything um so woke up pretty late i've been really tired lately and so slept in quite bit um which is uh what it was good it was what needed um i've been feeling kind of under the weather lately kind of sick which is you know not great but um i'm still [inaudible] procrastinating but should be getting better hopefully um didn't really do much today just cleaned my room little bit and then um went to like meeting for one of my extracurriculars and then hung out with some friends for while um and then like just sat in my room basically talking with my roommate which is nice um yes [sorta] really not much to say about today it was good day and i'm happy and i'm yeah feel kind of uh very positive about this day and you know very overall just very happy [or] you know moderately happy guess so was like today was extremely tired again i've been i've been sleeping like for the normal i've been sleeping for like eight hours eight-plus hours lately like the other day probably slept like 10 hours on friday night um but i've just been so exhausted and don't know why like to the point where i'm almost like thinking need to go and see the doctor because i'm just so tired all the time like could take nap just could literally sleep all day long like i'm just so exhausted when i'm getting more than enough sleep so that big problem that need to figure out um and also i'm just like so stressed because have so much stuff to do academically and then also i'm like worried that my social life is kind of falling apart and i'm just extremely stressed and like [inaudible] just think wanna go home and like just take break from school for just like five day am suc so stressed have so much to do that i'm basically doing nothing can't concentrate just need to get my life together um and was extremely irritable today like towards the end of the day was just in the worst mood was thinking to myself like oh god you know hate this school i'm gonna drop out or whatever i'm gonna transfer was just in such bad mood and was able to like you know realize how ridiculous was being and like you know took some time to like write some stuff down about just like how was feeling and things that i'm i'm lucky to have and like wh reasons to be positive and so need to work on that but it was just the worst mood it was like such bad day it been really bad weekend actually um and i'm going to my classes with very little prep um which is not good things obviously but you know don't know we'll see how how life go so today was would say pretty good day um had class in the morning and then went to teach my kids not my kids but students in an 8th grade classroom in [redacted] which is what do once week and don't enjoy doing it and don't look forward to it but uh th my um partner for it is nice guy um and it it fine and you know it'll be good for you know just it good experience to have and it'll hopefully be good for my resume and and you know it it something to do don't enjoy it but whatever it not really that stressful um and what else did do oh had really cool event tonight at the institute of politics so was able to hear an really important people speak about world security and um international affairs and saw caroline kennedy actually in the audience which was really cool it was kind of cool altered bit um and then oh shouldn't sorry shouldn't say names um saw former first daughter in the audience which was cool um and then found out that with my 'cause also cover also do reporting with the school newspaper so i'm going to uh probably be able to interview really relatively famous actor through that kind of two-on-one with my other guy that i'm writing the article with so this should be cool um so yeah it good day and and have lot of studying to do which is stressful but it coming along so today it was good day um there was some things that happened that was kind of maybe not good but i'm positive um slept well went to class which was good um so some major like social things that happened um found out i'm gonna be don't know if talked about this yesterday but i'm gonna be interviewing like one-on-one or two-on-one uh pretty famous celebrity tomorrow um which i'm nervous about but also excited and kind of looking forward to it and it should be like some amazing experience or not well you know very memorable experience it something i'll think about regardless of how it goes so i'm i'm very intrigued by it and need to prepare but will be looking forward to it so that kind of cool and kind of found out more details about that today um and then also like met with some people on my dorm which was cool and then um just like kind of reconnected with some old friend today which is cool um but also found out that one of the people that had been friend with for while since coming here to college like was kind of not um not very nice people and was kind of saying some stuff about me and some of my other friend behind my back and just was like not cool um and so and then like she came up and and sat with me at the table we was sitting at like while we was talking about her which was weird um and so it was just kind of upsetting but don't know how feel about it yet um you know was nice to her when she came and sat down don't know how feel about it but it was just it was it was upsetting and was very worked up about it in the moment um so yeah that kind of sucks just like learning that someone talking about you behind your back but it was good day overall studied quite bit was fairly productive and i'm determined to uh do good sh overall so that about it so had very eventful good day today um went to class as usual i'm trying to think like didn't really do anything very notable earlier in the day um but was able to sorry i'm tired was able to um later in the day went to uh conversation that very famous celebrity was having at the university and afterward was able to interview him one-on-one in like private room in the back and it was just really cool um just to talk with him and got picture with him which is really cool and so was stressed about that but was more excited than anything and it was like super cool experience it i'm very happy today because of it yeah it was cool um so that was the most exciting thing that happened to me and then went back to the newspaper and brought the article and that all came good it came out good um and now i'm i'm back in my room and was studying for while i'm gonna go to bed so it was an eventful day and and good one so not much to talk about today um was in really bad mood and i'm just worrying lot about uh the midterms have coming up all the the tests the studying have to do too have huge papers and also i'm worried about like social things and like making enough friends and keeping the friends have and you know just typical stuff like that i'm really i'm extremely stressed out have like well don't know if i'm extremely stressed out but i'm very stressed out get like rash on my neck when am stressed um and that rash isn't have made its appearance so that sucks but um yeah its just not been good day i've been in really kind of hateful mood and don't know i'm just kind of in funk and hopefully tomorrow um i'll be productive and you know think was productive today but hopefully tomorrow i'll just have um you know better mindset and ready to be productive and you know problem-solving and just better outlook so um today spent the first few hours of my day cleaning for my on-campus job with friend um and that was it was cool um mean don't know if it cool but it was like it was fine like so that happened um and there really not much to say about that then studied for the rest of the day was pretty productive today think i'm learning how to kinda get in the groove go to the library and um i'm i'm learning how to be more productive and have midterm coming up monday that i'm quite stressed about but am just telling myself that if put in the hours will do better than if did not put in the hours so that my motivation i'm gonna i'm willing to commit over the next few day also i'm worried that my like social life is kind of lacking which is always kind of concern and it just makes me feel uncomfortable wish it was something didn't have to deal with so that also source of stress um and yeah so overall that was basically how my day went so think today was very productive day woke up telling myself that was going to spend most of the day in the library and that is what ended up happening so have midterm on monday that i'm stressed about but i'm really committing myself to studying for it and studied for um uh quite bit today nice amount today and tomorrow i'm really gonna buckle down and do hopefully ton of stuff so that what mostly on my mind um uh as far as social stuff goes today as far as social stuff goes um didn't really you know uh not much to say had lunch and dinner with my friend um you know i'm still kind of worried that i'm falling behind socially yeah so whatever and um yeah so tomorrow have to goes deal with something which is kind of hassle like with my phone um i'll actually be getting new phone tomorrow but that shouldn't affect the survey so have to goes deal with that like figure out way to get there so it gonna take two hours out of my day which i'm like kind of irritated about but 'cause need to study and then i'm gonna um yeah it should be fun should be cool no well not fun don't know why said that but like it should be productive hopefully so um uh today well the major thing that happened was that had midterm exam for one of my classes at 1000 um and was really stressed about what was stressed about it going in but think did good job of managing my anxieties um and think the exam went you know adequately didn't you know it it was it was just fine i'm not that wor-wo-worried about it really um and then had to go all the way into [redacted] to do one of my extracurricular cu programs and then the person told me as got there that didn't have to come today so it was like hassle to go all the way out there and then wait and then come all the way back uh that was kinda frustrating um and then had meeting for one of my extracurricular which feel like i'm kinda falling behind and that that nervous nerve-wracking um socially really not much happened today studied quite bit um it was just kind of dealing with with other stuff so um today was i'm feeling pretty as go to bed tonight i'm feeling pretty happy and good um and yeah feel like it was successful day got lot of work done had dinner with my friends that haven't seen in while which was nice wrote an article for the school newspaper um and um what else did do yeah spent like the first half of the day going to classes and things like that um went to my lecture for one of the classes and that i'm in for the first time for like month so that was good it was like don't know just don't usually go to classes for that classes anymore except for section um so yeah there that and um yeah am feeling happy today and feel like it was it was good day and that about it so um slept okay last night and then went to few classes today um let me think what else did do um oh and then just studied for uh quite while um went to the library and just worked um have big paper due on sunday 10-page paper so kind of started thinking about that and i'll i'll write that over the next few days so i'm worrying about that socially uh not not much happened today was working for most of the days um and uh yeah so am you know and then at night just basically like chilled at right around midnight you know really didn't do much just sit on the computer so it was good days it was it was pretty mellow though um really not that much to to talk about but um yeah and not really any emotional things really else going on today so um today had another where wasn't very social just did lot of work have the big paper coming up that due sunday and so got um good chunk of that done and feel good about the amount of work did today did another short little essay for my my other class um feel like i'm on the right track and just have to keep up um so my parents came in this weekend for parents weekend haven't seen them yet but i'll see them tomorrow and i'm really not looking forward to seeing them um yeah just kind of stressful it like mixing of two worlds that don't really like um don't like the mixing it not that don't like them um and so i'm just stressed 'cause have like lot of stuff to do tomorrow in addition to like seeing them so it just like it become chore and have to uh like go to meeting and then go do some work like actual like paying like job and then have to like type more of this essay which is very long and tedious and requires just lot of energy um and then have to like read bunch of stuff and just have lot to do so it stressful but um oh and cleaned my room today so feel very accomplished with what i've done today so that about it my roommate kind of annoyed me but um nothing new there things is good it it good day so the big thing thing that happened today was my parents came for parents weekend um really was not eager to see them uh uh 'cause they stress me out in big way and had ton of stuff to do and still have ton of stuff to do but eventually like they was fine and had lunch with them and showed them around the campus so that was nice and was gonna get dinner with them and then like kind of figured out how to get an uber because they was like the guy was being an idiot and they wouldn't come to like the right area they was irritating so didn't end up getting dinner with them which was like put me in bad mood and then keep seeing mice and cockroaches that are really all over my room and they pissing they like absolutely disgusting and they unacceptable so they like so that big and then i've 10 pages worth of writing to do by uh sunday at midnight so they just lot of stuff to do and don't really know exactly what i'm writing about so i'm just stressed and i'm like they like kind of nuisance to have them here did enjoy seeing them but they like uh you know they i'm uh you know i'm just now realizing how like irritated i've been over the past day and i'm really not like didn't really see any friends today or anything like not many not much social thing happening was just with my parents um and um yeah and they stress me out so spent most of the day working on the sociology paper that have to write was very productive today quite productive would say um got like four or five pages done uh the quality of it is um you know debatable but um got it done which is what matters and then tomorrow have about like about two and half more pages to write um and then should be good so that basically what going on there um yeah so not too much to do there but just have lot of like editing to do and then saw my parents for dinner which is like nice but stressful and felt like was kind of in funk and don't know i'm just in different mood when i'm around them like in different gear when i'm around my family and it just it stress me out um and then just basically came back to my room and worked for while more and it like there lot of parties going on tonight um so was gonna like go out to one of that with um one of my friends but just have to work like th just have to get stuff done so didn't go out um and just like stayed in the in the basement and typed um which is what needed to do and then came back to my room and talked to my roommates for while which was nice we have like new couch that you can sit on and also like my don't know if talked about this yesterday but my room have like mice problem now that we've just developed which really sucks like in big way and um like it just stressful and don't want to have to deal with it like it creeps me out so um just i'm stressing lot today and like in the last few hours about blocking group stuff um and like who i'll be with next year um which doesn't doesn't have to worry well it doesn't happen formally until like february or march but i'm just worried doesn't i'm not really developing the friend group that would like to be developing and do have friend and lot of you know good relationships with people but just doesn't know maybe and and doesn't wanna have to force anything or really like work to cultivate friendships intentionally because that will just have probably the opposite effect of what want i'm probably just getting in my own head because do have quite few friend here but doesn't know i'm prob i'm know i'm worrying about things that everyone worry about or will worry about at some point um and then uh saw my family today which was good and it left back for where live and i'll see them again in like month um didn't really have i'm you know uh uh doesn't know wish it didn't uh hadn't come but whatever um but it was like fine when it got here and then um just worked lot on my paper again today finished my paper turned it in and so that was mean that was the bulk of the day um yeah and then had dinner with my friend so i'm just worrying lot about social stuff so um today um went to one of my classes at like at the section and then skipped the lecture from my other classes just 'cause knew was like not gonna get much out of it and ho well actually the real rea well should've should've gone but in an ideal world would've gone but didn't go because was so tired was like slept well last night but then woke up and was completely exhausted like and all day long think it was 'cause took like an am cold or allergy pill last night that just like knocked me out and it stayed with me whatever so was just really tired all day long and then did like that teaching thing do once week which don't really enjoy doing but that like fine and whatever yeah so whatever and then um was just kind of down for the rest of the day and worrying lot about like what wanna do with my life what wanna concentrate in um like friend stuff is on my mind ton and blocking group stuff is on my mind ton and just feel like really haven't made as many friend here as had hoped to and the relationships aren't as strong as would've hoped it would've been as it would be so was not happy today and think lot of it is that my life is like disorganized and it was kind of mess today so just need to and also my self-esteem has been like it was really high for while and then like week ago it was just kind of it det-deteriorated so need to just like get my life together and start thinking positively and proactively and pragmatically and should be um on the up and up so this morning um went to class and then just studied for while and had to go interview someone for like two important people for an article i'm writing and really am like kind of dreading writing this article because have to talk to lot of people and like it just kind of awkward and um like talk to peo and just like set up interview and like you know record people and it just it kind of uncomfortable and prefer article where really it it doesn't really require that of me so i'm just like ugh mean ugh just really doesn't like it but gotta get through it because it like um you know just gotta get through it but it was nice conversation um and yeah gotta get through it so that can um and it it good club to be part of and enjoy it overall but and then um like late tonight had was just reading little bit and we had like little study break with my entryway which is nice then me and my roommate and someone on my entryway went to go see like little chris or halloween thing which was cool um and that was basically it um i'm still kind of worrying about social stuff but was and was down for most of the day but am pretty happy now so slept in today until like noon um and um just because was really tired and didn't want to go to lecture even though maybe should have but skipped lecture for one of my classes and then um went to one of my seminars to my only seminars to classes for that um and uh today had to like interview someone or interview two people for an article was writing and always hate doing that when it like not super straightforward interview like when have to like figure out someone that willing to be interviewed and like ask around it just stressful don't like doing it um and so was like just and the guy was kind of terrible not terrible but just had kind of bad attitude and was like over that and then but talked to girl that was really nice so that was fine and and wrote the article i'm just glad it over that whole arti just didn't like writing it but like doing the um like writing for the paper just didn't like that article so i'm glad that it over now um and then dinner with my friends which is nice and um yeah i'm happy today so um uh not like much happened today really went

so think i'll probably have hard time falling asleep so they were like stupid move to do that um but whatever and classify they just like and classified the caffeine pill as um as drink of of caffeine uh like anecdotally so yeah that basically they okay bye don't know why said i'm like okay whatever so today really didn't have any like any classes at all so just studied for while slept in until

difficult time remembering what did today when was like thinking about recording this don't know if that means anything but like for completely forgot which probably means that today was like not notable at all um so yeah and was like pretty mellow today i've been like sad recently but it was not as prevalent today guess so today just um studied for most of the day or like good chunk of the day um and then went to dinner with friend like slept in late so that why this is like half my day missing um because slept until like noon um but um yeah and then went to dinner with friend that

although probably should've um i'm just like prepared to come back and it been nice break but like i'm very very ready to go back to school and i've lot of things to complete didn't do any homework tonight and really should've but just need to like go back to school and finish off the last few day or few weeks um until christmas break and then things will be lot better so had pretty um eventful day today uh got up at like o'clock in the morning 'cause had to get on flight um at 600 am to come back here to college and so ended up getting back here at like thr um like o'clock 800 am um and then settled in and took nap um for few hours 'cause was obviously really tired slept uh only little bit last night and then worked for like two hours and then came back to my dorm and basically just studied and um worked on paper have that due this wednesday um so have like ton ton ton of stuff coming up and just need to like focus on really getting getting it done and being conscientious about it um and th-that the main priority and also like haven't seen my friends in while so it like gonna be weird like getting back into the group socially so lot of stuff to think about so um well first of all wanna say that this survey just took an i'll them the people this um when talk next time but the survey just [took out] questions about how classes were going this last week and didn't go to any classes this last week 'cause were at home uh so just skipped that questions but other than that um today were like my first day like back in the groove of college um so had lunch with my friend and then another friend um mean uh like brunch kind of so two friend had brunch with um and ended up like keep for okay so this is girl that like [don't] really like and me and my one friend really like but the other friend there were like um friend that close friend is like dating and totally forgot about that and so started talking about this girl and then like he started like to backtrack in like what think were the most obvious way possible so it were like super awkward but were like oh my god um so the rest of the day were like thinking about that but hey whatever and then had like ton of stuff to do today for my um uh new like classes newspaper extracurricular um so were like had to go to too like an hour-long meeting today for that where were just like sitting there and then another meeting um and then had to do like an reporting and like reaching out to people i'm dealing with 'cause i'm like working on two stories basically so had to do lot of that and had like uh have nine-page paper due um wednesday and just basically started today but got three paper done three pages done which is good um and tomorrow have to do my stupid um like teaching kids which really don't enjoy but it the last day doing it so i'll be like just focused on the bright side um so i'm gonna yeah so it were like whatever that whole thing at brunch were really weird just hate that um but whatever it were overall it were like productive day and just need to maintain this productivity until december 13th when everything is over for the semester so the day started out with um me going to one of my classes which was fine and then had the last week for the semester of this teacher thing i'm doing where talked about it in the past where like go around here at local school and teach eighth-grade kids about government i'm gonna really really really really hate doing that like just dread it every week and so this was the last week was doing it in that classes so it was like big relief so it like happy day in that sense then i'm like finally done with that 'cause it was just not just it mean it was it was not good kids at all but one like we was saying my goodbyes like some of them like did like come up and like it like shook my hand and they're like really sweet and like uh was quite nice um and the uh so but don't know still it don't make it it don't like indemnify this semester i'm glad to be done with that and then just had like had to do like some article for the crimson so that was kinda new um very traumatic figuring all that stuff out and uh had like lot of work to do for that and it wasn't really coming together so that was kinda stressful and then had just ton ton ton of work to do for this essay i'm writing and it not coming together very well and have to wake up early it and do it tomorrow um so i'm really stressed about that and hopefully get that in and um well hopefully get that you know hopefully it it fine and i'm you know hopefully it it all work out so today was monly mainly voted devoted to um academics have paper due uh today basically 'cause it past midnight um and had lot of work to do on that and so was able to finish that up so spent most of the day working on that was very productive it was like really didn't have choice but to just get it done and the quality of the paper is um uh lower than would hope but it is done and it edited and i'm ready to turn it in so now just have to um get up tomorrow and turn that in um and then worked also had like sociology thing to do that was also kind of substantial and was able to like pull that out really quickly um which was good and i'm going to bed kind of late but [inaudible] [it] could be later and um so was very stressed about that but mean that was like basically the main concern had today and not much else happened i'm trying to think yeah mean really spent most of the day in the library or in my room just working on thing so had just like really difficult day um in terms of like was just really really depressed and um just like really hard on myself and beating myself up about things um definitely probably one of the tougher day i've had at college just was really sad today like don't know feel like i've been kind of drifting apart just kind of falling out of line drifting apart from friends thought had and it just difficult and just really being hard on myself about most of these social things um and then didn't do any homework today because was just like so much in funk and was just uh it was difficult day and i'm you know don't know had lot of issues and like didn't go to the don't know just bad stuff and um i'm hoping that tomorrow will be better and i'm gonna try to make sure it is so today was definitely much better day than yesterday for whatever reason was just really down yesterday um and think something that i've realized is that well first of all like the perspective have on things and if make the choice to be positive and like think positive thoughts i'll have positive outcomes or i'll have like positive you know mindset um basically just like the day ha like the mindset have over the course of the day is very much up to me and also that um the social interactions have is like really is hugely determined of the type of day that have so if like see some friends then i'm like really uh very ha like generally quite happy um but if like you know don't get in touch with my friends for day i'll be like oh gosh like you know things is falling apart and um it not really quite as bad as think it is sometimes usually and i'm anxious and so it just something that struggle with but um didn't do any homework today i'll do it tomorrow so yeah it was it was good day so had i'd say pretty good day today it important that just keep staying positive and remember that you know there are some plenty of good things in my life for as many as there are bad things um uh cleaned for while worked for bit with my friends um with one of my friends and then uh the topic of like blocking groups came up and that something really don't wanna have to worry about but um kind of mentioned it like oh like you know basically the conversation turned to like oh um uh we would be good blocking groups with like few of us and was like oh so it was like guess i've been worrying lot about lately so it good to know that other people are thinking about it and that like there potential that i'm like included in that thoughts but um don't know it just stressful and i'm not looking forward to the blocking season so that something i've been thinking about lot today and then have lot of homework to do and didn't really get to everything needed to get to today so just have to try to like stay on top of things and stay positive and just finish the semester strong so there really not much to talk about what happened today just did lot of studying um and worked have an big essay due and so uh worked uh quite bit on that um and so i'm gonna have like ton of stuff to do um over the next like two weeks so just have to stay on top of all that and um so today was like little bit stress at the beginning because wasn't really sure what was gonna write about and then ended up like kind of figuring out nice thesis and planning things out so that was just matter of doing my research and writing the essay um and really didn't ha like socially nothing really happened today was just working in the library it reading period so the the focus is really on um on the academics and just you know like said helping uh finish strong and um looking forward to going home in about two weeks but there quite bit that needs to happen before then so had quite busy day today slept really not so good last night um and woke up well slept for think it was like three or four hours last night and had to wake up at like 830 to go to class that had from 900 to 1000 and then from 1000 to noon slept so that was nice to get nice nap in and then the rest of the day have big paper due several big paper due so was working on that and um just had few meetings to go to um so it was pretty good day was happy today i've been very stressed lately and so it you know um just really important that learn how to manage my stress and um everything like that um so yeah that basically and you know i'm staying up late but have lot of stuff to do so that basically it so today was pretty busy day um woke up and then spent like an hour or so in bed typing because have big paper due several big paper due and then went from that to like meeting for my for like club so had to spend like an hour and half at that um and then came back to my room and eventually went to dinner at my academic advisor house with two with my um with like few other students that he advises and like felt was like stressed while was there and was like don't really know them and really don't like them like that something noticed like was stressed and was like oh my god i'm so like felt like was being like anxious or whatever and then realized like and normally would like totally be myself self over that but realized that like don't really like these people and don't care like don't want to be like them or like to like fit their standards or whatever so it was that was kind of like freeing moment to be like oh actually don't care and that something that usually don't think about unless it was interesting to put in that perspective and then came back and and studied for while so it been productive day and i'm happy today and think it uh really important lesson learned that like i'm very happy being the people am and you know although may kind of wanna like impr like don't know i'm happy being the people am and should be little bit less critical of myself then try my best in everything so so um not much to talk about today slept in and then had to go to another meeting for club that i'm part of and then worked for little bit and then had to go to anothe-another meeting and then worked some more and then came back to my room and i'm now going to bed so have still ton of work to do and it stressful and have studying to do on top of the work and i'm just worried won't be able to to finish everything in time but um yeah just have to to really try to work hard tomorrow there mean the just have lot of things to do and so i'm very stressed and that is really taking precedent in my mind um was uh pretty happy today not much to say um to guess kinda feel kind of lonely but i'm not really that bothered by it um yeah so pretty good day overall just very stressed about academic things in particular so today woke up pretty late again need to start waking up earlier and um went and had lunch with some of my friends and then went to the library and worked for while um and then came back to my room and eventually had dinner with another just few of my friends um and then went to the library again and worked for while after that um had lot of stuff to do today which was stressful um academically but got most of it done um well got bit of it done eventually uh uh went out again to get some food with my roommates which was nice and then um came back and worked little bit more and finished up one of my papers and just have ton of stuff to do these next few days are gonna be super rough but um need to you know every minute counts and don't really have minute to spare so have to really try to wake up earlier tomorrow so today um just spent lot of time working on my homework and the things need to study for um that was the majority of the day um woke up pretty late i've been going to sleep late and waking up way too early mean way too late um so that should probably be fixed and had to just be spend lot of time typing and then this after like this night there was like school-wide like event in the the yard like that was fun to like go and watch and so that was cool but um other than that really not much happened today um it was pretty good day and wasn't wasn't really upset or irritated by anything all that much it was you know productive day and just need to make sure that i'm that uh continue to stay productive tomorrow it really uh just lot of work to do so today was pretty similar to yesterday um just had ton of stuff to do so worked quite bit um and still have lot of work to do tomorrow an enormous amount an overwhelming amount and it like my the writing have to do is taking precedent over the studying have to do and the really need to start studying and i'm just worried won't have time won't have enough time for everything um so this coming week is going to be uh god extremely stressful and have lot of stuff to do and it gonna suck but just need to like keep breathing power through do what can um you know and realize that all can do is my best and i'm usually pretty good at well i'm usually extremely good with handling like academic type of stress and just knowing that like i'm doing my best and whatever happens it i'm just doing my best um and then also like had little meeting with um for one of my extracurriculars which was like fine and then um what else did do had dinner with uh an of my friends one of whom haven't seen in while so that was nice and um then came back and talked to my my roommates for while so it was good day but just have lot of things to do i'm stressing about like blocking groups yeah guess uh maybe i'm just stressing about blocking groups because um have like one groups of friends and i've thought hopefully i'll block with them and it kind of been brought up and now now like don't know don't know if it'll if it'll come through eventually and one of my friends says he wants to block alone potentially which is like ugh like weird and feel like all my eggs is in that basket and wish was little bit more social for that reason but other than that i'm really kind of fine and then my roommates brought up the idea of blocking together today which was like okay so i'll have you know few options hopefully um so we'll have to see it very stressful so once again pretty typical day just spent quite bit of time working um woke up later than should have i'm gonna try to hopefully wake up uh little bit earlier tomorrow um and just had lot to do and i'm not studying as much as need to be i'm just like writing um so have an exam wednesday that haven't studied for at all um but don't think it'll you know take too much time to study for it and um yeah it was good day had dinner with my friend came back to the dorm and there was like cat then cat like came in my room for while so that was like exciting guess and like literally very little happened today like have nothing to talk about was like stressed but like don't know woke up in kind of bad mood and then because little bit more positive and yeah so not much to talk about and probably having similar day tomorrow but maybe little bit more uh productive so had really difficult day today um just uh have lot of stuff to do and feels like won't be able to get it all done and it like the most overwhelmed i've ever been in my life probably and am being very dramatic right now um i'm just in that kind of mood i'm in the type of mood where wanna feels bad for myself um fuck this honestly have so much stuff to do and it overwhelming and uh so by today it tu so it tuesday morning and by friday have to write 15 pages of paper that do not even know what i'm writing about yet and have done none of the research and need to do an enormous amount of research for it so i've got four day to do that and then complete uh two final exams one of which have not studied for at all so i'm basically completely fucked and it not like i've just been sitting around doing nothing i've been working on other paper it like just don't have free minute just don't for the past two weeks like it not like i'm slacking off at all every second spend working and um ah maybe i'll be able to i'll have to get the paper done and hope will have time to study but i'm just hate this feeling and i'm ready for the weeks to be over i'm ready for saturday to come and be able to be done with this am angry and like under an enormous amount of stress and just fucking hate it and uh that it and i'm need to just find it in me to persevere and do what can and then get to that friday at 1159 pm and then just be like i've done what can 'cause don't wanna just shut down and have breakdown like already am kind of having so today was just extremely stressed out again because have so much stuff to do um and just was trying to get it all done and it was was overwhelmed really is the best word i've never really been overwhelmed academically as much as have these past few days have lot of stuff to do and when think about it it is overwhelming um so tried to get uh made the choice just to try to get one thing done uh did little bit of that have midterm tomorrow that really haven't studied for mean final tomorrow that really haven't studied for um so that gonna uh uh you know that gonna happen and i'm gonna do my best and think do know quite bit and it kind of something i'm i'm gonna be able to kind of bs little bit um yeah but i'm just gonna try my hardest and then need to write quite bit tomorrow and um yeah so when think it like i'm kind of in the final stretch and get that midterm done tomorrow mean that final done tomorrow no matter hows i'm gonna try my best i'm gonna wake up little bit early and study and then i'm going to uh get done with that i'll be out of that by 500 pm i'll be done with my hopefully my take-home final by like 800 and then i'll be writing quite bit tomorrow but when i'm done with that take-home final will feel like i'm in the final stretch i'll be able to take deep breath for minute and then do have 15 pages to write um over the next three days in something that i'm not totally well versed in but i'll be able to get that done and i'll have nothing but time for that over the next on um thursday and friday so after when get that exam done tomorrow and try my best on it two exam um one take-home exam will uh be able to breathe so it exciting that i'll be very close i'm close to the end of that and it stressful but uh i'm gonna wake up early tomorrow and study little bit try my hardest on that exam come back to my dorm do the rest of that exam do the rest of my take-home exam submit that and um take dep breath and begin my final assignment um so just about trying my hardest and breathing and thinking clearly at these point and getting some sleep so that what i'm gonna do now so today um most of or good chunk of my day was spent taking final exam had three-hour final exam which was like you know an exercise in endurance but it was like six essay questions in three hours and it was just really draining and think did like fine really didn't study all that much and you know did as best as could just like said would yesterday and so that all can do really so that happened got my final paper back for that course too which did well on um and what else um after that exam had dinner with friend and then went to the library and finished another exam had so right now i'm done with three of my four classes which is good but still have have pages done of 15-page paper that due friday so have my work cut out for me um and the pages i've done so far is not very good and the tf is very harsh grader so and i'm flying home tomorrow and like i'm not like haven't had chance to really pack or like get excited about it or like think about it at all and part of me just wishes had postponed it or whatever so tomorrow i'm dealing with that and i'll be at the airport and um uh getting hopefully quite lot done so that it so it about 420 right now and i'm just going to bed um and today was very busy very hectic extremely hectic day actually woke up and had to go to pack and go to the airport and then eventually got into plane and flew home and then had to come home and spend the rest of the night working as much as possibly could on my paper um got about four pages done and i'm gonna [inaudible] the six pages tomorrow so i'll be waking up pretty early won't be sleeping too much tonight it just too stressed very stressful and was irritable because of it so i'm just hoping to get that paper done and then hopefully it'll be getting close if i'm gonna work efficiently tomorrow and i'll do what need to do to to make sure it done and um today was really i'll be you know was tired today and irritable and it was not good day but tomorrow gonna be the same way and after that uh looking forward to just taking breath the end is in sight but still have ton to do so that about it so today just most of the day was spent finishing my paper for sociology wrote um wrote 10 11 12 like and half pages today which was quite lot of work but and it like wasn't uh uh very high quality but did it got everything turned in and um yeah so i'm finally done finally on break and able to relax little bit but just really stressful about two weeks now and i'm very glad it over and that basically just how spent my day

and just and it kinda sucks that like things just don't work out but it don't and i'm not really you know that basica that just that and um yeah so i'm trying to like trying to get more in shape and figure out what classes wanna do um next semester so that kinda what i'm focusing on and yeah that about it looking forward to what gonna happen next so um once again not that much happened today my grandpa left town today so just said goodbye to him um and then cleaned up my room little bit later in the day exercised um and yeah just kinda did few few other random things read little bit so yeah not much to speak of really today i'm still trying to to figure out what courses wanna take next semester and um all that stuff but things are going well yeah things things should be good yeah so that are basically it it was good day today i'm feeling good about everything so um not much happened today one thing i'm worried about is that one of my classes like the grades were due today for all classes and for some reason the grades is not out now so i'm like what is like why and know didn't do very well on the course so it like what going on with that um yeah and then i'm i'm not uh so like my sleep schedule like way off uh i'm just hoping that get that figured out and i'm trying to exercise little bit more so did that today and that good and were driving little bit 'cause still don't know how to drive so were like practicing that um and yeah i'm feeling little bit it just kinda weird have like headache after running so and drank water after so don't know why but um yeah we'll have to see so yeah um my sleep schedule gotten to the point where i'm going to bed at like 500 and getting up at like 300 or 400-ish um and really feel fine about it like prefer being up at night have nothing to do during the day typically because like i'm on break and i'm like very much embracing the idea of break and just not not doing anything not fulfilling any responsibilities feel great about it um so yeah like once again not much happened today um am glad to be away from school for another day but like wanna go back guess kind of but i'm like enjoying break uh enjoying having nothing to do and like zero responsibilities it great um [ever been] like at home with so little to do because when was at high school obviously had like million things to do and ton of commitments and so yeah this is great but um got back grade for one of my classes today and did well and was super like uh the final paper turned in was complete garbage it was so bad and wrote it in like three day and it was 15 pages and so was like god i'll be lucky if get in this classes and ended up getting an minus and so was like fine i'll take it like very happy with that um and yeah so that about it so now want just to really talk about today once again um i've been working out lately and didn't do it today 'cause it'd make more sense to start tomorrow like for new year or whatever or today yeah tomorrow actually um so yeah i've just spent the day at home not really doing much go to sleep at like o'clock and get up at like 400 which like feel really good about like sleeping as much want like this is like the best month of my entire life just like doing nothing love it it so great i've never had so little to do feel so good about it and then um know i'm gonna like go back to school and be really busy but it nice just to have this month to like do nothing and like sleep as much as want and like just said sit on my phone all day um and it really nice so yeah that basically it so today woke up earlier than usually do uh you know usually have enough break and just practiced still don't have my driver license so was practicing with that for while and i'm uh gonna hopefully take my test soon and do as well as can on that then came home and ate lot of unhealthy food and watched movie with my family and then exercised little bit which was good guess but um don't know i'm really been hating myself lately for like physical things which you know is not not good but that just been what i'm thinking about lot lately and was already stressed about like going back to school and how things is gonna work there like socially and academically so like just stressed but you know uh very typical so not much to talk about today um scheduled an appointment for friday morning to take my driver test so that should be exciting and hopefully i'll pass that i'm little bit nervous about that um because it so last-minute wasn't planning to take it so early but looking forward to that and i'm gonna practice over the next two days and hopefully will pass that um don't know i've don't know i've kinda been [eating] i've just been like don't know self-confidence has been like not good lately and yeah um but [inaudible] is fine honestly go back and forth i'm doing pretty good and um yeah just looking forward to going back to school [inaudible] stuff like that so today was pretty good day not much to talk about um and so um just kind of just finished exercising little bit um so that was good um and then throughout the day i'd ride little bit um practice driving my driver test is friday morning so i'm little bit nervous about that but i'm feeling little bit confident and i'm just gonna try my best and hope that everything goes well and uh yeah so that basically uh my day um thinking one more about what classes wanna take when get back to school and um just kind of get little bit stressed out every time think about it like the social stuff and the academic stuff you know is kind of stressful but it'll it'll all be good and i'll approach it you know with positive attitude hopefully and and just like to make myself feel stressed out when there really not much to stress out about things is going pretty well so um basically have my driver test tomorrow so i'm trying to get to sleep early and um that at o'clock in the morning and so i'm little bit nervous about that but just hope that get enough sleep to be awake enough for it and hopefully do well but i'm just gonna try my best and if failed wouldn't be all that devastated i'm just gonna try my best and see what happens um and so today just did some practicing for that little bit and then read little book [inaudible] which was good i've been watching on tv and then wrote something um yeah so some okay day having some mood swings lately but it like very um very typical so not really surprising and um yeah just trying to thinking lot about what gonna happens at at the test tomorrow so today was kind of uh nervous and woke up earlier than usually do um for my driver uh like driver license exam which passed so that was good and was happy about that and then went to the um dmv afterward to get my license and that all went well and i'm just glad that it all finally over and i'll have my license don't really need to drive anywhere anytime soon but it just something don't need to worry about anymore which is good and um yeah just really irritated with my family and ready to go back to school so yeah and still like thinking lot about what classes wanna take having lot of issues deciding on that so yeah it don't know it it tricky figuring out what wanna do but whatever so today um didn't sleep too well and then woke up and went to go see some of my family members so spent the day with them um we went to like little arcade which was fun for my younger cousins and then um uh like we went to ikea so like not don't know we just wanted to see them and so we did that that was nice and always like being with them and um then what did do came home and just exercised for while which was good um i'm don't know i've just been really kind of like hating myself lot lately and don't know why but my it like my mind is just try like really like don't know it weird but um i'm just not in the best mood and i'm anxious to get back to school so really not much to talk about today i've i'm trying to like i'm not like overweight now or anything but i'm trying to like get in shape um so i'm gonna like hopefully lose like 10 pounds or whatever and then start like um gaining muscle so i'm gonna try to do that and um so that should be good and so i'm just like on diet right now where try to just eat very little and exercise lot like wanna hopefully lose 10 pounds in like two weeks and then when get back to campus i'll be able to go to the gym regularly so ate like very little today i'm like pretty um one thing will say is have pretty good willpower so i'm hopefully gonna be able to keep up with that um and yeah didn't really see many people today didn't do much family kind of irritated me as usual i'm getting into kind of conflict with them and i'm really like said just hating myself lately which don't think usually do when i'm on campus so looking forward to going back to campus so not really that much happening in today uh drove on my own for the first time which was uh exciting guess so that was something and just went up to like store and like not too far away for me but that was good to just be able to drive alone for the first time and uh and um read little bit today and i'm starting to was trying to like eat little bit healthier so that still happening and going pretty well yeah not much to talk about today um my neighbors are moving so went over and said goodbye to them and um talked with my friend for while which was nice hadn't seen them for bit and uh it was good day not really that much happened as usual um lately i'm uh enjoying not being as busy so not much to talk about again today um exercised and then uh drove little bit because have my license so that good thing now driver license so can drive on my own i'm still not feeling very confident about that but it good and i'll be home for about another 10 days then i'm just um i'm probably gonna be going traveling little bit tomorrow we'll have to see i'm not really sure yet um traveling up up north little bit so that might be good [inaudible] yeah need to get my hair cut tomorrow just lot of stuff to do before go back to school in about 10 days tomorrow yeah so still have bit of time but not much and have to start just getting thing together for the spring semester have to figure out like what classes wanna take and what activities wanna do so um today thought i'd be traveling little bit today but that not uh didn't uh end up doing that i'll be doing it tomorrow maybe uh potentially but um so today just kinda drove the car around to like run errands for the first time um 'cause just got my license so did like um went and got gas and then went to the atm and went and got my hair cut so that was good to like just feel kinda like independent obviously at college i've been like very independent but guess [to do it in] car is um good step forward and just feeling felt like really inadequate today and like kinda depressed um but um then started to pick up and i'm just don't know hopefully just kinda get like this sometimes but hopefully going back to school soon will help change that and make things bit better just gotta be positive so today was another pretty straightforward day had originally planned on going up uh going on little like trip up north but one of my family members was sick so we ended up not doing that which i'm fine with wasn't too upset um so um was just spent the day at home the roads was very icy and it had just snowed so wasn't able to drive anywhere so i'm i'm just getting to point where i'm so ready to go back to school just because i'm really sick of my family and like do nothing all day but just like watch tv and then go on the computer and like like snapchat people and just mindless like stuff and um like there i'm just not doing anything anymore and i'm i'm ready to leave my family and to um go back to school and jump back into things so yeah so didn't really do much today either um i'm trying to think yeah it was the roads was pretty bad um so wasn't able to go driving so just stayed in and exercised um little bit which was good got into that little bit and um tried to you know have week left so when go back to school i'm gonna hopefully be more um like healthy and go to the gym more so um i'm like preparing for that so that the concern now and um getting little bit stressed about going back but don't know have week left so i'm not quite sure how feel about it at the moment but you know i'm always stressed about something always anxious about something which is guess bit frustrating so um today just was thinking on about the classes wanna take next semester and was kinda stressed about that and i'm gonna take one course that counts for two course so i'm debating as whether or not wanna take three course altogether um which would is the equivalent four course with that double course i'm taking or um four course so that something i'm thinking lot about and i'm also kinda stressed more and more about housing day and like getting back into the groove of things but think everything will be good and just have to go into with like positive attitude and um so hopefully everything will be good there and yeah about week left until go back and um yeah so just enjoying my final day at home and hopefully i'll i've been working out little bit which is good as well so once again not much to talk about um today am applying for freshman seminar course to take next semester only did one application and put like not much time into it at all so probably won't end up getting into it but don't know just did it 'cause might as well have something to do and if do get [it] probably won't even take it and so the i'm just spending lot of time thinking about what course wanna take and um worrying about getting all the requirements that need to get in um so that what i'm thinking about lot and i'm stressed about going back to school little bit but looking forward to it just kinda ready to go back but at this point um haven't been doing much lately and it been nice for while but it gonna be good to go back and kind of have responsibilities again and to um get back into the groove of things and yeah continue doing all that stuff so as usual not much to talk about again today um am still sp-spending lot of time thinking about what type of courses wanna take um saw uh friend of mine that haven't seen in while today um who um neighbor actually as well and um was moving away so spent some time with him and just said goodbye and that was like fine and then um have read little bit uh exercised today which is good and i'm just excited to go back to school and thinking lot about whether wanna take the equivalent of four cla of uh yeah four classes or five classes so 16 credits versus 20 um i'm not quite sure what i'm gonna end up doing but thinking lot about it and um yeah so not much to talk about today um i've been trying to exercise more lately and just kinda got sick of it today and tried to do it but it didn't end up happening so like that was don't know just have to try to get back into that um and um yeah i'm thinking lot about classes wanna take talked um talked for bit to friend of mine from from college who obviously like it was just over um over facebook which was nice just like except for like been talking with um people from well not haven't really been talking that much with the people from school as um over break and so it was jut nice to guess touch like touch in um but i've been kind of enjoying the distance from college even though it been what i've been thinking about lot so yeah few more days and then um i'll be back so um didn't sleep too well last night but that was fine and um like i've said if an i've been stressed lately about figuring out what my classes are gonna be next semester um and applied to seminar that didn't think i'd get into and only applied to one seminar like uh the freshmen seminar you have like many options and just applied to one thinking wouldn't get in and then ended up actually getting into it which are good guess but it think wou it was um just like lot of contemplating whether or not wanted to take it and um do think so i've just done lot of [inaudible] today whether wanted to take another seminar um in addition to the uh 16 credits that i'll already be taking um so yes it was just something had to think about but think um you know it all hopefully gonna come together nicely um so today was pretty good day was able to get some chores done around the house i'm leaving um i've leaving soon to go back to college so um just am trying to get them some things done and uh met friend of mine that haven't seen in months at um at restaurant and saw them for while which was nice then came home and and did some more things so i'm just in the process of packing and and i'm getting ready to going back to school which is stressful because have lot of stuff to do and um yeah just kind of stressful but it hopefully will all come together and you know it will and um and just very soon i'll be back in the swing of things and and figuring out what want to do for the semester and uh things like that so i'm looking forward to just kind of getting back in the groove so today was very busy day um in that was uh packing all day 'cause i'm flying back tomorrow um well guess today now and it was just really busy like last-minute stuff um to make sure that i'd gotten everything that needed to get done done on time and all that stuff and so just stressed not that got like everything packed 'cause packed in like three hours and was like 'cause it was the past three hours i've just been packing so just don't know didn't get to it for while um and uh so was stressed about that but i'm excited to go back um going on the plane tomorrow and then getting back with the groove of things being back on campus and just kind of starting the second semester uh um yeah so i'm just always kind of neurotic about packing and hoping get everything and right now i'm thinking about things that might have forgotten so i'm gonna try to go to bed soon but yeah just have lot of lot of stuff to think about so i'm back um at uh on campus after winter break um uh flew back today woke up pretty early and flew back and back on campus so that good and was nervous coming back was very stressed to come back but when got here saw my roommate and that was nice and went to meeting which already had to go to which was annoying and then uh saw some of my friends which was good yeah so good first day back um it gonna be good semester it gonna be great semester i'm looking forward to the [shopping] classes and figuring out what wanna take um and it that gonna start tomorrow so looking forward to that and um yeah just little stressed about housing day was brought up um brought up by someone today to me um [inaudible] just the like the politics of blocking can be stressful but i'm hoping it go smoothly and uh was talking to my roommate about it which was good and then think have couple other friends [inaudible] but we'll have to see so you know whatever had you know it doesn't really matter that much to me but still we'll just see so um today was pretty good day uh it was the first day of the semester so was shopping few classes um and things went pretty well there was um quite nervous today for some of my classes um took language course um and so the first day of that was bit intense and i'm just thinking lot about whether or not wanna take that course um for the semester and then had dinner with some of my friends that haven't seen um in like five weeks since before break um so that was nice and then my roommate came back and we uh kind of switched my rooms around and talked for while which was good and that was about it i'm just it was good day but i'm pretty stressed about um figuring out what classes have to take and and social stuff and and everything like that so um lot to figure out but i'm gonna try to just keep you know keep shopping classes tomorrow and and see what like and see how it all goes um so today was there was lot going on today actually like um well woke up and went to some classes then um shopping and i'm considering taking [inaudible] course and bought the textbook for it and just returned the textbook and now i'm thinking oh maybe should go back and get the textbook and take the course again don't really know i'm i'm just contemplating 'cause um it very nerve racking but like the idea of don't know just have to think about it so maybe i'll go tomorrow or maybe won't and um then was just kinda depressed for some of the day for reasons can't really understand just felt very my mind felt very disorganized and chaotic um and you know didn't go out with didn't go to dinner with any friends just like stayed in and don't know was kinda depressed today and then friends texted me about whether he wanted to whether wanted to block with him and few of my other friends which is what kinda had been hoping would happen and said yes so that might be happening i'm not really sure there but that kinda got me excited um because of course blocking is something stressful so just to kinda be uh done with it or have some idea of what gonna end up happening would be good and uh yeah classes schedule still stressing me out but and i'm gonna try to go exercising uh tomorrow morning so i'm going to sleep early um so that about it so um yeah today was don't know uh kind of an interesting day um uh um uh sorry about the background noise but i'm i'm i'm away from them uh went to class today this morning wasn't totally sure what courses wanted to take um but think i've kind of settled into that and and german is still um but it it an an intensive courses so that kinda stressful and then um met with my academic adviser and that was nice meeting and then went to courses with my friend and had dinner with them then after dinner it was just like don't know tend to kind of hate myself after like one-on-one social interactions and it don't know that can be kind of awkward don't know yeah just like beat myself up over it and it been something that like happening increasingly which don't really understand uh because talk with plenty of people have plenty of friend but that something i've kind of been noticing uh more and more frequently um i'm just kinda making up things in my head so that kinda shitty but whatever so today um woke up as usual at you know 700 uh late late 700 early 800 don't quite remember um to go to my o'clock course which have every day of the week and went to that course and i'm always kind of it language course it german so there lot of like on the spot like you're called on you have to know stuff and how to say things and i'm not quite good at stuff like that um so that stressful and i'm always kinda embarrassed and know it not super justified but just 'cause it it who cares but yeah so have to study lot for that and then came back to my room and just kinda feeling like not even depressed but just like wanted like you know i'm transitioning back to college from being at home for five week and it was like just wanted like day to like kinda be alone and so just like spent the day like in my room um good part of the day in my room uh like watching tv and like um like going on the internet and just kinda like relaxing like talking to my friends back in [redacted] like on the phone and just doing things that like um that kinda made me happy and we're not like connecting with lot of people here um at school where am now um so that was that was good and then was just like yeah really wasn't depressed wasn't sad but just like needed that time alone and so that was good to kinda recharge and um do nothing for while and then ended up going to dinner with one of my friends and then we saw another friends and then it turned into kind of bigger things where we um there this little bonfire outside so we talked for like like probably like three hours or two hours maybe um by the bonfire then played ping pong and then just like walked around bit and we talked little biout about blocking gro-groups um so it was like it was mores mores than expected and saw lot of people um so that was good to kinda like don't know after being kinda couped up inside it was like it good to to do that so yeah it was kind of big day in in the sense that kinda went from being in hall around nobody to being with few people so yeah that about it so um the past day like this day really did um just stayed in my room almost the entire day and studied for my german course it an extremely like i'm starting to realize how intensive of course it is and how much how demanding it is and so basically just kinda studied all day today in what was what was necessary to to even keep up and even now have lot more work to do so it you know stressful but knew i'd just stay in today and that was fine and so just did that and studied all day and then procrastinated bit which is frustrating kind of had like breakdown like oh can't do it can't handle it and then took deep breath and just really like kind of committed to studying for few hours um and made an good progress and i'm feeling bit more positive about things now but it just gonna be difficult semester and i'm trying to take extra additional extracurriculars um on top of that and it like can't even handle the extracurriculars was already doing with this academic load and um so i'm just kinda frustrated about that frustrated about the implications that my academic and extracurriculars have for the future things like that and wasn't worried about anything outside of academic today that was kinda the focus today didn't really talk to any of my friends didn't uh guess left the room like once or twice like ugh was just studying and um yeah so that that and how i'll probably be doing an other things tomorrow so uh yeah i'm we'll see how things go so once again spent good por-portion of my day um studying for german and then studied bit for some of my other courses um and then oh had meeting for one of my extracurriculars and so that like added pressure something just really need to work on um and then um had dinner with some of my friends and one of whom hadn't seen in while so it was cool to catch up with him and then came back to my room and studied little bit more um like said i'm just gonna have to to study lot for this german courses in addition to the three other courses that i'm taking so it gonna be busy semester but think can handle it and made some progress this weekend and um it just about studying and and being confident and that are two things need to work on and should be able to grow lot from from the courses and it it not like anything i've taken before but just gotta like said be confident and study and um hopefully can handle it know can so um not much to talk about today woke up at like the normal time like o'clock about and then um uh went to my german course which is an hour long um and that it went well i'm getting like more confident with it which is good but it still like lot of work and then um what did do came back to my room for bit and then had another course and then another course and um my third course have with my friend [redacted] so like we went uh together and it just guess good to have course um with friend and then have like so that like two hour and then oh had to interview someone for an article was writing and then wrote the article um and it was just lot to do but it was fine and then studied little bit more and uh had dinner with an of my friend who haven't seen in while which is nice and uh yeah it was busy day but it all went well so have quiz tomorrow in my german class so spent most of today studying for that i'm bit nervous about it but i'm hoping it it all goes well and um yeah so that tomorrow morning and um yeah i'm feeling okay about it and so spent just most of the day studying for that and um didn't really see anyone do anything socially really think about anything but the quiz um and had uh german in the morning and then had my expository writing course um and that was good it was my first day of that course and the teacher seems nice and the conversation was like interesting so um i'm looking forward to to being part of that course and um yeah so just focusing lot on that quiz tomorrow and hoping for the best i'm gonna try to study little bit more tonight and then and then goes to bed and um you know hope everything goes well so that about it so um today was overall pretty good day think i'm getting little bit sick um so that guess not great but should just be little bit of cold um had german test this morning and was very nervous about it but it seemed like everyone was nervous about it and don't think did too good um which is guess disappointing but uh sounded like no one else was really confident how it did so we'll just um kind of have to see how it goes and then ran into one of my friends at lunch two of my friends actually one of whom hadn't seen in while so it was nice to talk with him um and then just basically spent the rest of the day in my room and like said feel like i'm getting little bit sick so trying to just relax and studied bit um but not much to say pretty good day got some applications done for some extracurriculars want to do this semester so um not totally unproductive day either so um today was another busy day had my early class that have to go to um five day week at 900 am so had that um and it been good guess to get up early um and i'm worrying that i'm not gonna be able to keep up with it but just have to keep keep committing to studying and and things like that um and then came back to my room for bit had another class that went well and then eventually had to go and had um an article wrote um for the school newspaper that took like an hour and then had another class um and then what did do just came back to my room and um studied for bit and then had nice conversation with my roommates and uh yeah that about it it was um you know an okay day not much to discuss uh so today was pretty good day um had class in the morning for two hours and then went to get lunch and um then went then worked for while have have job cleaning things on campus and so did that with my friend for like two hours which was nice to talk to him for while um and then uh studied more for while and um went back to my room and uh and had dinner with one of my friend and um both of my roommates have their girlfriends over tonight so it kind of awkward just being in the room so i'm i'm sleeping like in the common [inaudible] area and don't know it just kind of irritating but it fine and uh oh and worked little bit more um just on homework and stuff and uh yeah so was good day so today um woke up pretty early and worked for bit and then had meeting and then worked bit more at um at my on-campus job and studied for while and ate meals with my friends and uh told to stay away from my room 'cause both my roommates had their girlfriends over um which which is guess kind of annoying just because have to sleep on the couch but it fine don't mind it too much um yeah so don't know i'm just really tired and thinking lot about what have to do in the morning and it just gonna be busy semester and i'm wondering if should drop one of my courses or just take it pass or fail so that something i'm thinking lot about too and uh yeah so we'll have to see uh so today was pretty pretty good day overall um slept in the bed which is good i've been staying up or i'm kind of getting up pretty early lately so it nice to sleep in this morning and was sleeping on the couch in our room because uh both our roommates had their girlfriends over um or actually no one of our roommates' girlfriends left but um the one that i'm rooming with in the bedroom had their girlfriends over so had to sleep on the couch for two day which was which was fine uh didn't mind it all too much but stayed out of the room for most of the day just so that you know it could have their space so that was guess you know whatever mean it was fine it was fine and um just studied lot today had an issue with kind of procrastinating and and not not getting everything done that needed to get done in the in the time period but ended up getting quite bit done and and so that good and um had meeting today for one of our extracurriculars which was fine and uh one thing i'm kind of stressed about is that tomorrow i'm starting new program where volunteer with kids in like an inner-city area that live in like government housing and um figured out the names of the kids that i'll be working with today and one of our friends who did it last semester told me that they're like is just not not good kids and that they're probably gonna give me lot of trouble so that concerning me and i'm ugh don't know because wanted to do three thing this semester so think what might do is um go tomorrow try to be as positive about it as possible and and hope that they're good um and i'm and i'm sure i'll be able to kind of work with them and i'm sure it'll go fine but if it don't have to debate uh trying to find something else um so that uh stressful thing to have to worry about but i'm i'm gonna try to just make sure that that it all go well so today was very active day probably one of the busiest day had i've had um all year got up early as usual for my german course and then had to run and prepare for meeting had with my teacher from one of my course that completely forgot about and then had another course for an hour and then had um uh an an hour off where had lunch with an friends and then had another course for two hour and then immediately from that went to volunteer program for my first time and actually really enjoyed that but it was just lot of work and then after that came back and had dinner and uh went and just spent the last like four hour at my at another extracurricular doing like night editing shift for the paper so it was stressful day and i'm super tired and kind of worried about how i'm gonna be able to function tomorrow but i'm gonna go to bed so um hi sorry just had to walk into private location but um just let me think what did today um didn't sleep too much last night got into my dorm pretty late and then had to wake up and go to my german course which kind of embarrassed myself at and then had [inaudible] writing course which um really enjoy so that was nice and then um had an interview for an program that might be part of over the summer and that was kind of stressful and don't know don't really know how felt about how did but was stressed out about it bit but think managed the stress quite well um and then studied for bit at the library had dinner with um few of my friends which was nice um blocking things seem to be settling out maybe which which is good hope there no last-minute drama and uh it was good day so um woke up at like 750 today and went to my german ca class which have every day and that went well was like debating not going just because yesterday kind of embarrassed myself and wanted to study more um but went to that today and it went well and then had another course which was just was super tired today because only slept for like six hours for the past two nights um and so actually yeah yeah so need to get to bed but um so that course was like kind of don't know was zoned out and didn't do thing and still haven't done any of the readings in that course so that kind of stressful then blah blah blah studied and then um uh had dinner with uh two of my friends and my roommate who haven't seen in while um and uh and it was good day yeah was kind of stressed as usual um this german course is big commitment but it was good day aft overall and i'm feeling very positive so um today was pretty good day i'm very stressed out right now because we just saw mouse in our room after seeing many mouse in our room and thinking the problem was deal was dealt with so um that horrible and i'm just stressed about it and pissed off at our uh roommates kind of and um but it it just as much our fault honestly so i'm just being weird and um so uh it was busy day and procrastinated lot when shouldn't have um um [contrived] like brilliant study for our german test tomorrow then have another busy day tomorrow so just have lot of of stuff to do and it constant i'm considering dropping one of our courses and it something i'll have to consider little bit more before monday and um [inaudible] just had busy day with lot of stuff academic and uh extracurricular and social and it was busy and things was good but this is bad way to end the day and i'm so just pissed like whatever so today was another pretty busy day had class for two hours in the morning german class and um it was had quiz and that went okay not great maybe even not okay but i'm moving on with my life and then had section and it was for my political science course and realized in that course how little liked political science how little liked social science in general and it was just kind of like an awakening moment like oh my god should not be studying what thought was gonna be studying and then it was like should do premed because like the idea of being doctor know i'd be good doctor and like interacting with people when i'm in position of authority so was like maybe i'll be premed so looked into that and um will not be gov concentrator will not be sociology concentrator or uh an economics or social science concentrator in general social studies either uh so that that was big development for the day it was just like like just realized that the course like fucking hate when i'm learning so that was interesting and uh and then so i'll probably do humanities or uh premed maybe uh but think do still probably i'm going to enjoy law school just don't like don't like uh oh shit is it that don't like science and then probably shouldn't be premed don't know i've still gotta figure an stuff out don't like social science so we'll have to see so today was just busy day really uh every day of the week is really busy day um including weekends this semester and that which is gonna be tough to managing things and don't know that can manage everything i've decided that i'm probably gonna drop one of my courses which should make things tiny bit more manageable which is good just have to spend tomorrow writing about four pages and then have to uh have to go to meeting and write an article and do german homework and learn german and really should be reading from my government courses so tomorrow gonna be hellish day i'm just gonna try to get up early and um power through and today also is very stressful had to uh worked and typed for while and i'm just stressed out about my writing courses and about what wanna do for the summer and then what wanna do with my life so it just it tough but i'll figure it all out so today was just very hectic day for couple of reasons um had lot of writing to do and had very little amount of time to do it so that was stressful figuring out how to fit all that in um and then uh had to do something for an extracurricular i'm gonna be missing class tomorrow just so can get an extra sleep um and need it and i've earned it and uh uh it shouldn't be any major uh big deal so and um was just don't know today it was just completely academic day didn't think think about anything social had lot of homework to do and it was stressful but got through it kind of and um yeah dropped one of my courses just because realized it was gonna be too much work um so uh it was kind of big decision to make but feel like it was definitely the right decision and now i'll have little bit less on my plate and have lot to do tomorrow and just am gonna always have lot to do guess um so today just can just um slept in and missed my 900 am course because have was just up late last night so felt like it was best if went to bed mean if if slept in bit which was nice and then also missed one of my extracurriculars today just because had to study and so felt fine about that wasn't too worried about missing that and um and then just studied lot uh had few meals with my friends which was nice and uh i'm trying to think yeah not much happened today um starting to dropped on of my course so my academics this semester should be bit more manageable and have to um go tomorrow and kind of organize my third extracurriculars which hasn't yet begun um but just um i'm just focusing on kind of managing my academics at this point so today went to my german course and it went okay still have lot of studying to do um and uh and it just difficult to catch up um but that went well and then had uh my [inaudible] my uh writing course which was nice course and uh met someone who kind of had few things in common with which was cool and then um studied for bit and um met with uh co-teacher of mine for that i'll be teaching civics with next or like tomorrow we begin um so that was interesting and then um yeah and then had like study break tonight where we talked about blocking groups which was pretty straightforward not much to say about that um it was yeah it was nice nice day still just am very busy and have lot of stuff to do always which can be stressful so today was pretty busy day um had my german course in the morning as usual and that went well and was feeling confident but wasn't able to study as much as would have liked to today and just need to spend some time thinking about how important it is to study more and then had civ um uh had to started new semester of doing the teaching program do in new school with new person um so that was cool and it was tricky to figure out how to get there but it was he seems like nice guy and it was nice class and um that went well and it should be good semester um on that front and then um uh studied bit had dinner with some of my friends blocking drama is still present and um kind of stressful and i'm just really tired and um like said just need to focus on studying more and hopefully blocking stuff is figured out because it seems like it just stressful situation for for everyone so um today was pretty pretty good day wasn't able to study as much as had originally intended um but went to my german course and then went to my writing course and then went back to my room and studied for while and um eventually had another course uh film screening which was good and then went to dinner with some of my friends and then came back and studied some more um one thing that kind of irritated me was that don't know just feel like come off as bit dumb um kind of intentionally and don't mind that and feel like was just being kind of don't know don't like that but also um just feel like was being kind of judged by some people for some of my interests by like my friends tonight and just kinda pretentious and un and unnecessary feel like um but yeah don't know it was overall uh pretty good day um so today was pretty good day um had my german course in the morning and that went well and feel pretty good about about that course and then um studied for bit and um went to dinner with few of my friends and then my friends did like comedy show like 930 so that was good and then um don't know went back to my room it wasn't very eventful day and was kind of not very interested in um being around people yeah for good part of the day just like wanted to be alone which is good and that important to be that kind of way every every couple of day um so um was able to sleep in bit today which was good um and yeah so slept in studied for bit um had lunch it was pretty good day overall um was fairly proactive studying studied more today than was usually able to do and then don't know i'm still little bit stressed about blocking i'm worried that things are gonna fall apart 'cause that seems like something that might happen and i'm [gonna] you know knock on wood but um really hope that things just go well um and kind of had breakthrough moment today just few minutes ago when was thinking about my german course and how sometimes don't study as much as need to because know that can still get by on the course and do well on the exams without studying all that much um but just kind of at this moment [once] like i'm in the course to learn german um not not just to get good grade and so if commit to learning as much german as can that good grade will come and that kind of think the key so that was good moment so um have german test tomorrow uh uh and that something that i've been studying lot for today and i'm just still would like to study bit more for that so that something might stress me out bit but th think i've learned that you know i've just gotta try my best and then mo-move on with my life and i'm working towards trying my best um and had uh don't know there was not much of um was mostly studying had meeting for one of my extracurriculars that was like fine not much went on there then um yeah just studied and had dinner with my friends and um yeah it was fine day not much to to say really my sleep schedule feel like i'm not tired at all um already tried to go to sleep so that kind of weird but other than that things are good things are yeah going well so um today ended up being not super busy day but quite stressful day um had german class in the morning and took quiz in that class and uh it didn't go well so that was kind of frustrating but hopefully i'll do better in the future and just need to study more to ensure that do better and then had uh meeting with one of my teachers about one of my essays and she basically told me that like all of it was wrong so have to rewrite it which sucks um and i'm ve was just really frustrated with that for while and think it just gonna take bit of time for me to figure out where to go from there um and was just very frustrated with her and like the whole class um and was just irritable today and didn't really wanna be around uh mu many people and don't know not much to discuss today but i'm gonna try to go to sleep and hopefully tomorrow will be productive day so feel like was marginally more productive academically today than am most days i've just been very lazy lately and just kind of focusing on like instant gratification and entertainment as opposed to studying and that like just obviously huge problem that need to mediate and i'm gonna work on that um and so that just like my number one concern at the moment and then um uh kind of good thing about the days was that figured out my essay topic and that like worked good that worked well um and still have to write write it and figure some thing out and then wasn't able to study as much german as wanted to because was just slacking off lot so it just huge huge problem procrastination that need to stop and it just sign of immense weakness yeah and need to stop it everything is gonna happen tomorrow in my head and like tomorrow never comes so i'm just gonna try my best tomorrow have to write bit for my paper write about 650 words which shouldn't be too bad um and then study bit and so should be good days so um today worked lot on my paper and was kind of stressed about having to write that but it seems to be coming together okay and so that good um and also was little bit stressed about blocking today and just but had some good conversations with my but with my hopefully my blocking group and so that seems to be hopefully panning out well um and that will open up um on monday the official blocking uh situation so looking forward to just kind of getting through that um have lot of work to do over the next two days lot of work but i've have had to do more in the past and it always turned out okay so know that i'm capable of doing this now it just matter of doing it and procrastination is still big issue that i'm i'm worrying lot about i'm stressed out lot about but hopefully i'll be able to manage everything and just keep things um under control so um uh spent the first two hours of my day in german course and that been going pretty rough lately and um i've just been having difficulty um staying up today in that course and my teacher kind of pointed it out so that was low point and then studied for bit worked on my paper for bit and then worked for th about three hours on my on-campus job with my friend and then had dinner with him afterwards so that was nice and then came back to my room and worked bit more it was good day was little bit irritated by and then like just disappointed from the from the german interaction that mentioned earlier um and so so i'm just very stressed this weekend as well because have lot of stuff to write and lot of studying to do on top of that so it been kind of difficult day and it gonna be an difficult next couple of day and i'm sort of just worried about [blocking] stuff as the date approaches but hopefully um hopefully everything gonna go [on] when work hard so um today was pretty busy day where had quite bit to do um started the day by going to my friend--my roommate and one of my friends uh was in comedy but not comedy but like dance show type of thing so went to that to support them which was cool um saw that and that went well um and then just have an enormous amount of homework to do and so i'm gonna end up having to write five pages tomorrow which is very stressful and tried to write lot today but wasn't able to get as much done as would have liked um and i'm just gonna probably not sleep for too long tonight so that can get get what need to get done done tomorrow and still know you know i'm gonna try to stay positive and just do everything um so yeah that that the plan i'm i'm stressed so um today was just very busy day from an academic perspective um just had lot of stuff due and so spent the entire day working on that and was pretty productive pretty efficient still wasn't able to study for my german course nearly as much as would want to which was upsetting um but just need to try to get an sleep and i'm gonna wake up bit early and try to study an german and then go to german course and hopefully not make fool of myself because don't know the content so um today was kind of rough day had really difficult time in my german course and realized that i'm falling behind in major way and have fallen behind and so now it just matter of kind of fighting to to get caught back up um and so that been very stressful um and then so just spent good part of my day working on that and then also kind of finalized my blocking plans and went through the process of formally inputting blocking stuff which is big relief to kind of be done with that and um and know that have blocking group to be part of and they're all people rea really like and it it all good it should be it should be good and um i'm sleeping less but like said i'm just uh very very worried about my german course and that kind of the main priority and the main concern at this point it lot of work and i'm just not as don't know i've just gotta tell myself that can do it uh so today good thing that happened was finally used my blocking plans and my german course went bit better than it did yesterday but still i'm just really struggling and i'm starting to panic about how difficult this course has become um and so don't know it just it very stressful and um yeah like said um i'm i'm just worried about being able to catch up and i've never taken course that been this hard for me i've always done well and so this sucks and then i'm also am has quiz tomorrow so just gonna try to get up early tomorrow and study for that um but yeah it should be hopefully i'm just gonna try my best and uh just has lot to do so today um had my german quiz which was just i'm not don't know how it went we'll have to see we'll have to see um and did my civics class which is like uh going to teach these people in [redacted] and these these kids in [redacted] and it went really well and so i'm excited for these semester um for that reason and also just lot of homework that is like impossible for me to keep up with and i'm just trying and kind of failing um but i'm just trying my best and uh so that bit stressful but like said i'm i'm trying my best and uh and hopefully it all will kind of come together and i'll be able to get done everything need to get done i'm just very stressed and i'm very tired and my sleep schedule have been very kind of out of whack lately um but i'm just gonna you know try to keep working and and pull everything together as as soon as possible and just maintain that so today was an interesting day had my german course in the morning and that went well and everything went well today but just had th weird interaction at dinner where guess friend of friend was sitting with us and guess she just like didn't was indicating uh via body language that she was like not fan of my personality and my other friend picked up on it and told us about it and that just kinda bothered us and made us think lot about the way behave um so that was not cool and i'm still like myself i'm still like my own i'm so yeah would rather wouldn't uh rather be anyone else um and uh so just have to work tomorrow i'm gonna sleep in i'm not going to my german course tomorrow just 'cause need to sleep and won't be able to sleep in my bed for the next couple of day because my roommate is having his girlfriend over so whatever i'm just gonna sleep tonight um so that should be good and things is good other than that just bit depressed guess but was bit of funk so today um don't know pretty low-key day uh slept in bit which was nice didn't go to my german course which uh don't feel fine about and then what did do cleaned with um worked with my friend for few hours out in my on-campus job and that was nice he cool kid and then uh what did do just it was nice to talk to him for while afterwards and then came back to my room and uh went to like dinner with my roommate and then like worked for while had some stuff to do like lot of stuff to do and so worked on that then finished that and um it was good day um still have lot to do tomorrow but yeah it was good day not too much to say so today was kind of rough day um just tried to get lot of studying done just don't wanna be here anymore i'm trying to go to sleep out on the couch in my common room because can't sleep in my bed tonight because my roommate has his girlfriend over and there are just mice in this room and just need to sleep but can't and i'm just bit irritated so that basically i'm just frustrated right now and that what i'm feeling i'm thinking that need to fall asleep that won't be able to because we saw mice in here last yesterday yeah so i'm just debating what gonna happen i'm uh i've kind of been in heightened state emotionally i'm just very irritated so today was an extremely difficult day for me um had just rough experience early on and um it was it was tough and usually when would have difficult experience like that would just gonna hate myself after it and then have to do little bit but not as much and i'm proud of myself for that and i'm proud of my original aims throughout the situation it was just difficult day and i'm already at tomorrow and i'm already um i'm glad that tomorrow is new day i'm gonna wake up but i'm gonna try over these next five day i'm gonna commit to giving everything have to to my life to my academics finish strong and then go home for week and um just relax entertain myself constantly and just be relaxed and safe but until then just need to work on my academics and try my best in everything so that can tell myself tried my best and don't know that need to try my best in academics so i'll try just need to try my best in social things and [inaudible] like the issue that had today was kind of an interview-related things and tried my best in that so i'll just try my best and leave the rest so that kinda the the things i'm dealing with now so um today was definitely better day than yesterday but still i'm kind of haunted by the difficult situation had yesterday and

to try to get to bed soon um have 900 am tomorrow but yeah studied bit and had meeting for one of my extracurriculars and then went to dinner with um my block mates which was nice and uh yeah it was it was cool it was an interesting dinner we talked about lot of stuff and just learned an things about them that didn't didn't know and it was kind of weird interesting but also like lot of food for thought came out of it so that was good um my i'm bit worried about getting back into classes but know that i'll do well and that i'm just gotta keep trying and and make it all happen yeah so today was um my first day back in classes since spring break and and they went pretty well had two classes today and i'm always nervous in my german classes but just need to wori work on preparing myself and you know thinking positively about the course and you know they always goes fine like i'm gonna be fine regardless and just need to remember that you know i'm i'm safe they cool then had an uh [inaudible] [pretty] interesting um re-revealing conversations with an of my friends that uh just surprised me and so yeah so just just an dynamics um changing and shifting with that stuff and uh yeah just studied bit and i'm just trying to be more productive for this semester and they was they was good day overall yeah definitely so um today was pretty good day slept really uh not so good last night um so that that wasn't good but um just yeah so came back to my room and took nap after my classes and then um uh just did some some work and then had dinner with my friends uh so that was nice um it was uh don't know i'm just focusing on getting back into the groove of things which can be bit difficult um it was nice to have the spring break but it kind of think threw me off so i'm working on just getting back in and it all going well and just need to wake up um bit early tomorrow to finish up some homework but yeah i'm happy with how things are going and had some good conversations with my friends today and um and i'm happy with life and kinda i'm gonna think go to the gym tomorrow um and get on that regimen again so today was um pretty good day not much to talk about was really debating whether or not wanted to go to my german course this morning and got really nervous um beforehand and when got to class but just have to realize that it always go fine can always get through it just need to you know think positive thoughts to myself and i'm just stressed out by it but think it you know just need to focus on preparing and then you know when get into class kind of doing the best that can uh so that definitely important um and then the rest of the day went and did taught class for one of my extracurricular activities and that always nice um but it bit draining um and yeah it was it was it was good outside of that and um looking forward to the day to come i'm gonna start working more and um yeah so it was good day overall i'm happy with it so today was an interesting day uh decided to skip my german class in the morning which wasn't sure if wanted to do um but just didn't just wanted to sleep in so didn't go to it and um then had class from 1000 to 1100 and that went well and had meeting with one of my professors about something like had uh written for class and that went pretty well and i'm think might be on the right track with that essay and um still have bit of work to do um but we'll see what comes out of that and then uh had another class and then had dinner with two of my friends uh which was fine guess um just bit down think lately um but it was it was good day overall and um yeah so um uh today was um uh an okay day woke up um didn't sleep very well last night my roommate had lot of people over um until late in the or early in the morning and it was just keeping me up and it was bit obnoxious um or very obnoxious so slept poorly and then had two-hour german class um and it was really stressful because like the director of undergraduate studies was there like watching me and like evaluating my performance so think had like mini little panic attack while it was happening um but it was all it was all good and got through it um so just gotta remember like you know convince myself that it'll all go well and then it will um and um then like cleaned for like four and half hou or did my like on-campus stuff which is cleaning stuff for like four and half hours um with my friend [redacted] and uh oh shouldn't mention names but whatever uh so we'll say my friend uh and uh and uh yeah that it okay bye so um today was uh an interesting day uh slept pretty well last night um slept and just because it was really long week was gonna wake up early but decided just to sleep in instead so that was good um and then uh just worked bit on homework was gonna work bit um on my on-campus job but didn't really have time for it so just worked on an homework i'm just stressed out about all the work have to do stressed out that my grades aren't gonna come together stressed out that feel like behind socially and um just like deficient generally is how feel so that really stressing me out and i'm trying to work on that um and just have an issues that is um uh bit stressful and then also summer plans is stressful think have everything decided there but it just don't know thinking [about how] i'm gonna fund everything because i'm gonna be going abroad so uh just feel like i'm lot less uh lot more you know uh just def uh deficient relative to everyone else here so so um today was pretty productive day uh woke up pretty early to start studying had bit of quite bit of work to do um or fair amount at least and so studied bit and uh and i'm gonna wake up early tomorrow and study bit more and just hope hope that this german test goes well um have test tomorrow and um yeah and then just worked on uh had meeting for one of my extracurriculars and went to that it was pretty easy straightforward um and uh just hoping to get you know do well in my stuff tomorrow and i'm stressed about academics but am just working on improving my reactions and stuff like that don't know i've just never been this stressed about academics before so it um something i'm adjusting to and i'm hopefully doing good job of that um yeah and friend stuff have been weird lately as well but that all it all gonna be fine it'll be good so today was pretty interesting day felt bit under the weather uh but i'm you know mostly fine was really nervous to go to german class today for some reason i've just been um don't know it just stresses me out lot and get in my own head about it and was just really stressed about it but um that ended up going okay um so that was good in the end and then had another class and then something really exciting came in the mail for me so it was just exciting to to get that um and then had dinner at my house for next year with went to with my blocking gr with my uh blockmates which was nice um was like fine that was fun [i was struck] with that um then came back to my room and studied for bit and that about it it was good day overall um i'm just stressed about lot and things that need to do that i'm not doing but you know typical stuff so um i'd say today was semi-successful day got quite bit done and made commitment to stop procrastinating and was able to uh stick to it knock on wood um so i'll hopefully try to get uh continue working tomorrow have um big essay due thursday which is really stressing me out and just feel like quite bit is hinging on me doing well in it so i'm just trying to um basically just take what steps can to do well um so that the focus right now yeah just um don't know just uh guess you know my ultimate grade will be out of my control won't determine it but can just take as many steps as can now and put in as much work as can now with the time have left to um hope to you know use the advice i've been given and write as the best essay um possible mean that all can do so that what i'm focusing on now and i'm bit stressed uh but it should be good um so today was an okay day um uh just have big paper to do tomorrow so i've been focusing on writing that lot and was able to concentrate okay better than usually can um but um still just don't know i'm never gonna be able to get done as much done as want to get done so [inaudible] had an extracurricular today where go into [redacted] and teach 5th-graders an stuff so that was fun and it always good it kind of time commitment but it was uh you know always enjoy it enjoy it this semester so that was

very well but i'm just gonna try my best and hope for the best and uh yeah i'm bit nervous about that and um skipped class this morning like do um occasionally um just because don't know didn't really didn't wanna go and and well just ended up staying late and just didn't wanna go to the 900 am [inaudible] be fine um and um i'll be heading to bed now and hopefully just i'm focusing lot on that test and didn't really see any friends today or do too much socially um also had class today at at 100 pm which went to which was fine don't really enjoy that class but just matter of getting through it so yeah things am things am fine and i'll be cool so um today was pretty good day had my uh test early this morning that went really poorly um but what can you do hopefully uh you know don't know hopefully i'll be able to make up for it um later um yeah so that should be fine or that should be uh something focus on studied lot today and um worked bit on my on-campus job and then had meeting to go to for my summer job um which went fine don't really like the people that are there uh but it it just job you know that all it are really and so um i've just gotta get through that and it should be good then came back to my room and studied bit more uh it was good day overall and uh should be good rest of the week for sure that about it so today was an interesting day um studied or um slept like okay last night but was just super tired throughout the day so took like two naps and don't feel any shame about it was like really tired and still am um and then um like had lunch with friend had class early that was like not well and it never is but whatever don't care had an extracurricular where talked with uh where um like teach kids and that was really fun enjoy that but it takes like three hours to do um with transportation and everything so it took while um and studied bit and um uh went out to eat for dinner which was nice um and yeah i'm going to bed now i'm just worried bit about what wanna do for the summer i'm considering maybe should try to graduate early stuff like that um yeah so just lot of lot of stuff on my mind but um everything should come together i'm sure so today was quite busy day um uh um what did do went to my german class in the morning which went well and then um uh had another class which was fine and uh then um ah i'm trying to think of what did slept for while and then um no no didn't sleep for while don't know was in my room for while and then had another class and then got dinner with um what ended up being like quite few of my friends which was nice always like seeing um everyone in my blocking group plus few additional people that was really nice um yeah and then had to studied bit and then had to stay late like until 100 am at my at like 130 am on my on-on-campus like extracurricular activity to edit some stuff so that was stressful but it was good so got very little sleep um last night um which wasn't cool had to stay out late um and so didn't sleep much and so spent good part of today napping and just kind of laying around but also got some meals with my friends which was nice and studied bit and went to german class which went nice i'm lot less stressed about going to german now that the teacher that we have changed just have to focus on studying this weekend have some stuff to do tomorrow uh training have to attend which is gonna suck but don't have choice so yeah and um it should be hopefully good good day i'm bit stressed but and sh probably should be bit more stressed so just need to start working bit harder probably so um today was pretty busy day had the training thing for three hours for the summer activity that i'm doing um which was really nervous about because in the past i've like not done well around these people but it went fine and have more of that tomorrow so that'll hopefully go fine and whatever have lot of work to do tomorrow also like school stuff um which is don't know i'm just i'm i'm just behind academically and need to get caught up and every day it get bit trickier to get caught up but just there not enough hours in the day so it just don't know trying to do it all and not really being able to which is stressful but that pretty normal and i'm just um interested to see how thing is going to pan out ultimately and yeah that that about it i'm bit stressed but i'm trying to stay positive and just figure out what else can do to grow and thing like that so today was once again pretty busy day had training for about three hours um for one of my extracurricular activities here on campus um and um so just did did quite bit of work for that and then um studied little bit [inaudible] something to write from uh my classes i'm just stressed lot but i'm i'm feeling bit more hopeful i've kind of given up on [inaudible] classes and it just about finding motivation to push through mean so yeah just need to realize that um um can't change with the grades i've already gotten in the classes but can do my best to bring up the remaining um quizzes and things like that so it bit stressful but i'll figure it out as it comes so today was pretty good day had german class this morning and it went it went fine got through it um and then had lunch with friend and then um what else did do studied for while um don't know i've uh the test tomorrow that i'm bit nervous about but i've studied for it more than have for the previous test i'm gonna get up early and study for it some more and hopefully i'll do well on it um it just lot of stuff and it kind of overwhelming academically and looking forward to the end of the semester and uh what else there lot of kind of social pressures at the moment uh so i'm not sure what gonna happen with that but um yeah it it was pretty good day hopefully tomorrow the test would go well i'm bit nervous about it and um had lot of caffeine today so hopefully i'll be able to sleep well i'm sure won't be and took some melatonin okay so that about it so today was pretty good day had test in my german class that was worried lot about and um hope it went well don't know if it did but tried my best on it and studied for it and think was more prepared going in or at least felt more prepared than was in the last one so who know guess um what what get at this point is it don't really matter and um then slept [inaudible] and just extremely extremely tired lately and probably haven't been getting enough sleep uh but i've i've just been very tired and just probably not helped by the fact that i'm going to sleep at 200 am to wake up for 900 am class but yeah so that about that about it there i'm just stressed but and bit frustrated with life at the moment but got some good news back today so i'm happy about that for sure yeah i'm very happy somewhat so today was stressful day but um it was fine had my german class in the morning and that went fine that um going better lately knock on wood um but i'm hopefully gonna prepare bit more in the morning um and then had di uh lunch with friend then just studied for while um have uh an assignment an essay assignment to do in my writing class that i'm just having like very hard time coming up um uh topic and everyone else already have their topic and the teacher actually reached out to me to to give me specific help so that stressful but um yeah i'm just bit worried about an social things just have lot on my plate that i'm not really taking care of but um yeah and so that basically it it was fine day overall so today was an interesting day um classes went well and everything and um yeah th so that was all fine um actually uh there was one of my stress one of my classes that stressed me out because can't figure out what want to write about and think kind of figured out something today but still don't really know and i'm just it never good to feel behind um and like you're not on top of things just need to work on getting on top of things and starting to improve my life um have uh my grandpa is not doing well he in the hospital and he may not um uh be around for much longer hope that he is and it seems like he getting better so that good news um it um [inaudible] of course i'm very saddened by it and and well [inaudible] well it seems that it seems that he getting better so guess am optimistic and i'm i'm not thinking the worst right now i'm not expecting the worst um and don't don't know guess i'm not with him so don't know how bad it is but i'm not expecting the worst and i'm not thinking to myself that he going to die i'm not even considering it really but um i'm just hoping that my family keeps me updated so today was oops just dropped my phone um today was pretty good day um had class for two hours which went fine and then saw few friends for lunch which was nice and um spent the rest of the day studying and had few things to do but um yeah good day overall not much to talk about there was big party on campus that didn't end up going to i'm gonna just stay in and then study yeah really have to work on studying but um yeah things things was good today overall pretty good day hmm hopeful and went to the gym as well so um today was just stressful day in uh multiple ways because as the day went by realized that had more academic like assignments to complete that didn't realize so tomorrow should be very busy day and have i'm not don't know oh god yeah so i've kind of painted myself into corner and i'm bit fucked now but we'll just have to see what happens and um yeah so i'm stressed but i'm just gonna try to give it my best tomorrow and see where it gets me um yeah so it it should be you know should be able to gets through it hopefully uh i'll just try my best you know am who am can't go back in time all can do is try my best from here so uh that what i'll do and uh yeah that about it quite bit of work to do lot on my plate for sure yeah so today had just lot of academic stuff to do lot of stuff i'm very very busy almost as busy as i've ever been academically um and tomorrow is going to need to be the most productive day i've had in my life because just realized have five-page paper due that haven't started yet um and it is 10 of my grade plus quiz that need to study for that uh this is on tuesday and don't know anything for it yet or yeah so very little for it yet so tomorrow need to be the most productive day of my life and need to like get in the zone and and just be ready for it i'm gonna work very hard so that um you know ge so that don't know so the things this essay and the quiz contribute to grade so i'm gonna try to do well in them so that can boost my grade up um so i'm gonna yeah by working hard tomorrow i'll be able to kind of kick my grade in the upward direction which is very good in the long run um so yeah that about it and also had this weird things up at friend today we went to like an escape room and uh [inaudible] wasn't very fun wasn't into it and it just kind of reveals the like because was with my blocking group and think it just kind of revealed the um don't know uh think lot of my personalities came up and revealed bit of think confli-conflict within the group and um don't know [inaudible] it don't know it important that we all have friend outside the blocking group which i've known before that but it just verified that they're all cool guys though that about it so today was um pretty busy day um am just very tired had lot of work to do lot of academic stuff to do um so worked on getting that all done and um yeah saw my friends we figured out my housing stuff um and so that was stressful what else is going on have quiz tomorrow that i'm not really prepared for but what can you do um yeah so it was just stressful day and things am getting things am gonna get tough especially as the year comes to close it just stressful i'm looking forward to 24 hours from now i'm just gonna push my problems onto tomorrow so go to sleep for little bit and then study some more and that is about it so today was um pretty busy day um uh just had lot to do had class in the morning and uh took test in it and it went poorly but don't really give shit and then napped for half of it and decided just to skip my writing class to nap and feel fine about that as well and then had lunch um with my friends out at my new house next year and dropped off some housing forms and then um worked uh couple hours got got bit done then had meeting oh then had dinner again with the same people and then had meeting with few other people that was really nervous about and do don't know struggle bit in that types of settings but did better this time than did last time so that good and then uh came back to my room worked bit more and uh it was good day overall um so today was um an okay day had german class in the morning and um and that uh went went fine guess and then um uh had lunch with friend and then um went back to my room and eventually went to the gym and exercised bit which was good step in the right direction and um yeah i'm just stressed lot about academic things stressed about an summer plans and uh just lot on lot on my plate lot wanna do and just don't have time for all of it or the the willpower i'm stressed about grades lot as well and typical things but um yeah i'm just gonna try my best something i'm rarely rarely able to do so today was fine day had my german class in the morning and that went fine and then had lunch and then worked for little bit with friend of mine on my on-campus job and that went fine um and don't know it was good day overall have lot of work to do for my german course and i'm just as usual struggling to find the the motivation to do it uh so that don't know it not great but um yeah i've don't know just have lot of work to do lot of work to do which sucks but um yeah we'll see what happens suppose lot of stuff going on this weekend so today was um pretty good day um had lot of stuff to do um uh hosting someone to visit us from my hometown so spent some time with him showed him around um that was fun and then saw some of my friends for meals it was little event at some upperclassman house that went to which was fun um well actually it wasn't fun like at all but it was like it happened and so it was fine guess and um yeah that about it came back to my apartment and straight to bed i've had issues um with motivation lately so that something i'm focusing on and i'm just kinda pushing forward and finishing up this semester um on as high note as possibly can so that about it yeah so today was another busy day um uh continued hosting this kid from my hometown for visit to us which was nice um and just had lot of work to do lot of studying um things like that and just um towards the end of the day got really stressed out that have so much to do for my midterm and don't even know where to start so i'm very stressed about that and finding finding the time to do everything that need to do and there not enough hours in the day honestly need to stop procrastinating and start getting on it um and thinking about motivation and why i'm doing what i'm doing i'm doing it so that get good grades and that have you know better future ultimately so that what on my mind so um i've just been little bit um think uh in kind of funk lately i've been really down on myself and i've just few minutes ago kind of contextualized put things into perspective and just thought to myself like don't know there like i'm doing very well overall uh and i'm just gonna need to take stock of my life and realize that i'm at really great school um i'm on the right track in life i'm way ahead of most of other 19-year-olds um and have more potential and just am more capable and things like that um but there am some kinks that need to work out some issues that need to be resolved and some am just like normal wear and tear but some am like don't know bigger personality issues that have so i'm thinking about that lot so today was pretty good day overall just um the next two weeks have lot of academic stuff going on and just need to make the commitment to dedicate the next 14 day of my life to improving the rest of my life and um realizing that i'm not gonna get in all my classes but if spend the next 14 day working as hard as possible can get higher grades than would if i'm continue in the same trajectory right now um and so that what need to think about and um had my german classes today it went fine uh uh don't know had lot of questions today and for some reason can't think about what did don't know like studied little bit what did do oh god can't even remember what did today but few things yeah and it was productive day somewhat and um yeah it was good day but just need to find motivation you know within me without doubt so today was long day um had my german class in the morning which would you know don't know it just yeah so that happened and then had meeting with my um professor for one of my writing assignments and um just have lot of work to do um that assignments um is due may 6th so have think about 10 day to work on it um and actu-actually had lot of critique but lot of like really substantive stuff so i'll be able to like go from there and write good essay and and do know the work need to take need to do um so that that good and then um studied for little bit met with someone um and what else did do uh had big test kind of competency test i'm staying after school for few weeks to like work on cleaning team and be captain of team and um had big test for that and then like don't know was nervous beforehand but was able to like [hype] myself up and it was fine going in was really fine going in and then was fine you know throughout and fine leaving but don't know just had lot of critique but think lot of like stuff need to learn yeah so i'm i'm really miffed about part of it but it was good day overall yeah don't know this [bitch] had kind of an attitude which irritated me but whatever ugh whatever okay that all yeah so today was long day hadn't sleep too well last night and uh got up early for my german class which meets at o'clock in the morning uh so don't know decided was planning on going to germany over the summer with the with the program here [inaudible] but decided that i'm not it not worth it to spend the money and really don't wanna go and am not at the level where could go so that was tough choice but i'm making it and um so i'm really home for the summer and uh hopefully spend lot of time alone hmm yeah just uh feel like so much of the choice make now the way that live my life is for other people and compare myself to other constantly so need to just try to get away from that and recharge my batteries and wanna do that over the summer so um today was not as productive of day as would have hoped originally um don't know did some work it was fine talked to my friends it was fine don't know it was fine day whatever not much to talk about i'm feeling fine worried about my finals but just need to think about my competition um and do as well as can yup so that is about it um yeah [inaudible] i'm just like really bad at making decisions like really bad oh my gosh don't know how could be so bad but am [aber ich bin] yeah so that cool dude don't know dude don't fricking know shit

get done big german test coming up on tuesday um uh that need to just study for tomorrow and study for few other things study for the the one day of tuesday and then i'll just do as best can spend an

last day in my dorms and then um moved um or didn't move but um don't know what did do today had meeting for um thing and just got really overwhelmed and almost had kind of panic attack in the middle of the meeting which i'm embarrassed to say but just breathed and was fine and got through it so just need to kind of realize that don't know for whatever reason stuff like that scares me but can get through it if just breathe um yeah so i'm fine just need to realize i'm confident i'm fine can get through anything fake it till you make it yeah so that about it so today was really long day and tomorrow gonna be long day as well um just have lot of work to do and i'm just pretty exhausted um and think i'll be exhausted for while um yeah just need to drink some coffee in the morning had to um just worked all day long 'cause i'm doing staying on campus for most of the summer to clean and today was the first day of that and so i'm bit nervous about directing my creative but just have to like make sure take some time to get in the right mental state beforehand and breathe and i'll i'll be fine [inaudible] [ahead] it should be cool it seem to have [you know] some of them have some attitude so have to deal with that which is exciting um yeah so just gotta smile and breathe um yeah so have lot of work to do tomorrow did lot of work today very tired um should have tried to get to sleep earlier but can't was super busy and um yeah that about it uh so today was really long day um i'm working [inaudible] as captain so have to basically be on my feet all day training crew and then chucking on the crew and helping the crew so spent basically the entire day standing only got five hours sleep was just totally exhausted um but don't know did lot of work and made lot of money so

then it will all start back up tomorrow have to get back up at about get up at about 655 so um 655 yeah so i'll have about seven hours to sleep about yeah so that should be good okay so today um was pretty good there was some hiccups but it was overall pretty good and also today was perfect day so um was working dorm crew uh getting that all set up or getting them all ready um was the captain so was just running around lot looking for my workers checking in with my workers inspect their progress um so that it was stressful was on my feet all day pretty exhausting but i'm making lot of money doing it so just do um not worried about making my deadline but worried that there little things that are gonna fall through the cracks um yeah so don't really stuck to the specifics of the plan that i've made like these like you know hour-to-hour plan but defin-definitely take the order that thought things are going and staggered things like planned on as like the the the big general aspects just didn't really find too much for me to rely on rely on anything more than uh kind of general stuff so today was really stressful day um i'm kind of trying um i'm basically i'm in charge of the evening crew that cleaning two whole buildings and tomorrow our last day of cleaning and i'm just trying to figure out how we're gonna get everything done on time um so that just been pretty stressful um but hopefully it'll all come together hopefully i'm managing um yeah so have some good workers and i'm just stressed about that but think it'll come together and it just about planning and making sure i've planned enough and yeah so just i'm thinking i'm lot about that and trying to make sure that i'm perfect there it nerve-racking and stressing stressful yeah so today was um pretty good day overall just um i'm working dorm crew as captain so have to clean finish cleaning one of my buildings today or get my crew to finish cleaning and make sure they're all on top of it and overall i'm pretty happy with the job that we did um yeah it not perfect but i'm i'm happy with the work that we did and we kind of hit all the bases that we needed to hit um yeah so think it was something to be proud of overall which am um yeah and and have few well i'll be here basically all summer um so but it was good first week um and yeah just really tired and looking forward to being able to sleep bit

lot over the last couple of weeks so it was hmm just nice to be able to sleep in um and so did that and then went out for bit walked around and um yeah and then went grocery shopping for some grocery that need um hmm and that was nice and uh yeah now i'm back in bed going to work tomorrow but um yeah so that should be fun and fine and that it bye-bye so today was pretty good day um was back at work spent almost the entire day on my feet was like ro running around walked like seven miles um just doing stuff so yeah it was really busy day um and then kind of stressful day because found out have an interview again on wednesday with the same people that interviewed really poorly with the last time um but think i'll be lot more comfortable around them this time know them lot more i'll know to kind of take minute to prepare to breathe before the interview just like go to the bathroom look in the mirror and just focus on confidence which is something wasn't able to do in the last time so this is chance to kind of indemnify myself um but i'm still worrying lot about it worrying that history will repeat itself but like said i'm lot more comfortable around this people um and yeah the stakes is higher this time or the stakes well guess the stakes is about the same but um yeah well the stakes is maybe bit higher but i'm still um i'm worried but [inaudible] that i'll do good [inaudible] confident take the time to prepare and and beforehand just that that mental mental preparation and i'm hyping myself up it such an important thing and all this people is is friends they're all good people and um i'll just get through it and realize that um it just little tiny thing so today was really long day um i'm con still working dorm crew um so i'm doing that um so this is training i'm running around all day run around like 10 hours day um as captain um so that lot of work but i'm getting paid lot for it so that makes it all worth it um and then one of my friends came back to the campus and saw him for couple hours which was nice caught up with him um i'm just really stressed about what gonna happen tomorrow and whether or not i'm gonna be able to finish my assignment and was able to plan for couple hours tonight what wanted to do so um that should all go well i'm just you know worried about lot of things as usual but life will go on yeah so things is kind of winding down um 24 hours [inaudible] from today will be very good today was pretty good day um was able to sleep in and then was spent most of the day alone and then went and saw friend for dinner which was nice so today was pretty good day um i'm working dorm crew and this is my last week and think it gone good so far and i've gotten better as time has progressed as captain and this final week is um my last week here so it just kind of the time will show everything that i've learned and i'm stressed but i'm prepared for tomorrow and now the best thing could do is just get some sleep um i'm nervous because kind of my boss will be watching me tomorrow um but it just it is important to remember that all can do is my best and i've prepared and know has the skills to do it um i've done it the past two week so just need to rely on that qualifications and the confidence that the accomplishments of the past two week uh could give me and can do it and i'm going to do it 
3KS75,today felt good when first woke up had pretty normal day had few things wanted to get done um getting closer to this evening felt more stressed out and anxious as my roommate decided to have her boyfriend over without really telling me in advance and then found out that he would be staying over the night as well which didn't really have an advance notice on causing me to be stressed out and feel uncomfortable staying in my room so felt like needed to go somewhere else so isolated myself and tried watching movies but that got my roommate to be frustrated at me because wasn't interacting with everyone else so just removed myself from the room and went off to read and reached out to my family back home for help and my mom was little bit helpful but she also just stressed me out more because she wanted me to reach out to people that i'm not really close with in the end did end up reaching out to another friend and hung out with her which really did make me feel lot better but still feel anxious about going back inside since my roommate and wasn't really getting along earlier and now she thinks that i'm upset with her and i'm not really sure what happened with her boyfriend but i'm gonna go back in and figure it out and in the future thinks i'll reach out to [redacted] and start talking to someone so don't feel stressed out and out of place and can feel more comfortable in my own space in my room today felt pretty lonely my roommate went back home and is staying home overnight so spent the majority of my day in my dorm room and spoke with my mom on the phone for bit but it really just stressed me out 'cause she was just complaining about my family back home and went shopping but the store was closed so couldn't get my school supplies which made me more anxious because have lot of stuff need to do for my [redacted] class coming up and can't do it until buy the supplies that need um and then i'm more stressed out because i'm shopping two new class this week so i'm gonna have to figure out whatever missed from the last week and lot of people in my entryway was hanging out today but didn't go with them and isolated myself which was not the best plan but have hard time interacting with people especially without having friend already there so isolated myself but i'm gonna work on it and made an appointment with huhs to go and talk to someone so hopefully that will help today generally felt little bit better went to new class that was super interesting um went to new club that had good time at spent the majority of my day with my friends and my roommate and we did have little bit of trouble but not too bad and talked um for while with my family back home and it was pretty good overall and friends from back home also called me and it was really nice talking to her for the little bit of time and other than that was little bit stressed about the class and having some stuff to do tomorrow just because of having to buy textbooks and being unsure of like how much wanted to spend but will be going to work later in the week and training for second job which will definitely help out the financial uneasiness and tomorrow i'll try out one more new class and hopefully my schedule will be set and that will help me to have little bit of stress relief because i'll definitely have set routine going into the week next week today was pretty good day overall had bunch of classes so got pretty busy with homework and stuff but managed to get all the assignments done that needed to get done i'm little bit behind on the reading but that just because i'm starting two new classes and still have to wait for my textbooks to come in so hopefully can get caught up tomorrow have pretty busy schedule but talked it out with some friends and it should go all right and i'm training for another job so hopefully that will help me to be less stressed about my financial situation um we had meeting with my entryway today but it was really crowded and hot so didn't stay for long i'm still glad that went because got to talk to few other people in my [inaudible] and got to hang out with my roommate and good friends from upstairs so overall it was pretty good day and may not get too much sleep tonight because still have quite bit of work to do and catch up on but i'm looking forward to the weekend when can have time to go back over everything and really prepare and hopefully get caught up in the classes that just started today was really good day wish i'd gotten little bit more sleep but after woke up super early got ready for class and had little bit of time to relax and put out some things before had to go to class and class was super interesting and i'm really excited because my book arrived so get to pick it up tomorrow and then i'll get to start reading and catch up on some of the work have been behind on and taking notes [inaudible] interesting have quite few assignments going into next week but my saturday and sunday looks pretty clear just have to pick up some shifts at work which i'll probably have time for tomorrow evening and and saturday evening so that should help and also just got trained for my second job today which was really easy and fun and should start that job either this week or next week which will be nice to get paid little bit more than usual by doing [a supplement] job and math is sort of stressing me out but think i'll get assigned to workshop which will definitely help because then i'll have someone that can help me with homework and things and make it go little easier also had my first day of lab today for my science course and it was really fun and just have to do lot for that but have friend that can work on it with which should make it easier so overall it was pretty good day today started out fairly well didn't really get enough sleep last night but still felt okay this morning just little bit sore classes were really fun and interesting and felt like really understood the work and had good time working with some classmates as well that helped make it little bit easier also went and worked with dorm crew for about two and half hours which were fun just having something to do that really felt productive and had time to relax in my room didn't really eat enough in the morning which didn't realize until later but then did eat and felt little bit better and towards the end of the evening started getting upset 'cause were just thinking about my cousin who passed away last year and my roommate really wanted to hang out with people but didn't want to but we did it anyway and just sort of got upset and she sort of made scene in front of other people so felt more awkward and so spent the rest of the evening alone in my room and it could kind of tell that were upset but didn't really feel like talking about it but tomorrow we're supposed to get some stuff in the mail and we're gonna go shopping so hopefully i'll feel little bit better then today was overall pretty good day got to sleep in little bit later and and then got the futon delivered to my dorm and so my roommate and opened it together and sort of spent the whole day relaxing got few of my text books in but decided to focus on homework tomorrow and try and get caught up on the week tomorrow and just spend time today relaxing with my roommate and friend of mine and my friend got into the band which was really awesome and we all went and had lunch together which was nice got to have ice cream and then my family from back home sent me surprise and so got that which was exciting and we basically spent the whole day relaxing in my dorm and sort of planning for the rest of the week we might go shopping for little bit tomorrow but also have to do all of my school work and then later this evening we hung out with people from my entryway and watched movie and made plans for sort of weekly movie night which will be really nice because it really good time to connect with other people and have sort of relaxed atmosphere so overall the week looking like it will go pretty well today overall went fairly well slept in really late which was nice and relaxing but also had lot of homework to get done and so sort of counterproductive ended up staying way too up way too late working on some of my stuff for class because was really stressed out and had hard time focusing on some of the things needed to get done had quite few assignments and projects due this week and definitely feel like i'm little bit behind but feel like it'll get better when actually go to class also have job training tomorrow so i'll be working shift so it looking like busy day and i'll be starting to set up some appointments to talk to counselor which would help and also need to call huhs to see about going to chiropractor because it hard to work on homework for extended periods of time because my back will get sore really easily so think definitely setting that stuff up for this week will help today was an okay day stayed up little bit too late last night trying to get an homework done 'cause ended up overthinking problem and confusing myself and having to spend longer time trying to figure it out because it was due today so still managed to get up on time and managed to get to class on time but think i'm gonna try and have set time to wake up every morning to keep into more of sleep schedule my other class went okay and my other high points of the day i'm probably getting my homework back because did well on it um talking to an new people in chemistry class and um working my first shift on my second job it was lot of hard work but sometimes just being able to do something that like manual labor is very helpful it makes you feel productive and it also sort of wears me out so feel little calmer and more relaxed whenever went back to my dorm room also got to stop by brain break and get an hot chocolate and snack which was really lovely and tomorrow only have one class so should have plenty of time to get my homework done for the next day and to work on an assignments that is due by the end of the week today was feeling pretty under the weather but still managed to get up and go to class felt pretty bad 'cause was kind of falling asleep during class so felt bad for my professor but still en managed to take some good notes and still get bit out of the class so it still good that went and then went back home and worked for few hours which was nice and then managed to get lot of homework done and went to dinner with some friends which was good 'cause haven't been making it to [redacted] on time to eat um and after that we went back to the dorm and took nap 'cause was still feeling pretty under the weather but think i'll feel better tomorrow i've gotten quite few assignments done and should finish up another one tonight so i'll have little bit less to do because picked up quite few shifts at work for thursday so my thursday will be pretty busy other than that i'm just little stressed out because both my class sectioned me for the same time so i'm gonna have to resection but will write them some email and in the end it should work out today was all right stayed up little bit too late with my roommate and friend because they didn't wanna go to bed and really should have gone to sleep because had lot of classes today and lot of homework that due 'cause i'm trying to get stuff done in advance so can work some shifts tomorrow so really stayed up too late and was kind of falling asleep in classes went by to try to get help with my homework but couldn't find my tf so [inaudible] instead and hopefully i'll hear back 'cause that'll make me feel little bit better about some assignment that gonna be due on friday i'm little stressed because i'm gonna have some exam next week that don't really feel like i'm ready for but since they most of the weekend should have plenty of time to do practice problems and think we're gonna get practice test as well in classes to take home so hopefully i'll have time to prepare for the exam my roommate going through really hard time with her boyfriend which is difficult for me as well because they needs some extra support right now but i'm really too busy to be exactly there all the time um they wanted me to stay up again with her tonight so plan on staying little bit later than wanted to because really needs to go to bed 'cause have some early classes and was falling asleep in classes the other day so think i'll just stay up with her for bit work on some more of my stuff while am and then wake up early to get coffee to try to make they through tomorrow and do have some appointment tomorrow with the counselor and meeting with my adviser in the morning so hopefully it'll all go okay because i'll get some support and maybe some other advice on what needs to do today was pretty stressful day woke up sort of late rescheduled meeting with my academic advisor because was too tired to go to it went to class um had few other things had to get done and then had to go to work which was stressful got caught in the rain couldn't finish my shift because it was late and couldn't get into the buildings so ended up getting back late to try and start my homework so i'm still up doing homework and my roommate having really rough time so she left to go to talk to someone and we kind of had little bit of an argument so i'm not really sure what to do and i'm not really sure if i'll get my work done 100 like wanted it to be because have class pretty early and just found out that i'll have another extra class have to go to tomorrow which will be interesting so hopefully can get it all done in time and get it turned in and and over the weekend should be less stressed because won't have work and i'll have time to prepare for next week and maybe get caught up and hopefully things with the roommate will work out better in positive was that went to counselling today so that was nice and really think that it'll start helping after start going regularly today overall was not the best day didn't get any sleep last night had to get up early for classes classes went fine but feel unprepared for my test that next week i'm just actually gonna have some trouble with the homework that was due this evening um went to work had some trouble with that had to work with some delivery guys and they weren't very happy and wanted me to call my boss and stuff so they was pretty stressful but in the end we got everything delivered they just took lot longer than they was supposed to um then went back to my dorm and tried to finish the assignment that had been struggling with and then heard from my mom who told me that my grandmother is in the hospital and they they not really anything her heart rate was just high so they fine but they just made me think of my cousin and the assignment was working on was over someone death which made me think of my cousin more so overall they weren't the best evening but sort of reached out to friend that haven't spoken to in while and they was there for me and my older sisters was which made they better and i'll get to sleep in tomorrow and meet up with some friend and go out to dinner and picked up some extra shift at work so they shouldn't be too bad and then should have plenty of time to study this weekend and get some homework done today did not go very well woke up pretty late and didn't really get much done because i've been pretty upset about my grandmother being in the hospital and my roommate and my friend didn't understand that and stuff that was mad at them and even after explained they was very sympathetic and just sort of wanted to do their own thing um and tried to go out with them tonight after got off from work because really felt better after working for two hours and like sort of exhausting myself and so we went to sort of party but they just didn't wanna keep doing they and sort of forced me along with what they wanted to do um which is fine but also not what had in mind and sort of like talked over me so can't really talk to other people because they manipulated the situation which sounds bad to say but that what they seems like they was doing so overall i'm like pretty upset and i'm pretty stressed out because have [inaudible] exam this week and i'm really not prepared and really didn't get any of my homework done because i've been upset about the stuff going on at home and the stuff with my roommate so ended up leaving [inaudible] ended up going to movie too because they wanted to see some guys they liked so they [inaudible] with them but didn't wanna do they so ended up leaving and talking to my mom and my sister for while and then deciding to go to urgent health services which don't know what exactly i'm gonna tell them but at least something will help just don't wanna keep getting upset and crying and they hard because feel like can't be in my own room since have roommate but i'll talk to people at health services and see how they go so hopefully it'll end up getting better today overall went really well woke up pretty late and [inaudible] 'cause had trouble sleeping last night but was able to spend the day relaxing still got to watch movie with friends and we ordered some pizza and had some other snacks needed to run to the store to get few things needed lot of school supplies and then was able to work on my homework for while 'cause had kind of lot but it fairly easy to understand and was able to get help on the stuff that didn't understand and so hopefully i'll get all that done not too late and still have little bit of time to relax um also felt lot better today because heard that my grandmother was able to go home from the hospital so that was good and talked to lot of my family members back home and my older sisters who are also off at school and we talked about all going home for thanksgiving which would be nice um other than that i'm pretty sore from work um because haven't been able to see chiropractor but hopefully will have time this week some time to schedule to be able to go and then i'll definitely feel better after that and think it could be next weekend uh some of my friends and are gonna go shopping for winter clothes because hopefully it will be getting colder soon and other than that the only things i'm really worried about are the test that have on wednesday but should have enough time to prepare for it between tomorrow and tuesday so we'll see how it go today was really easy didn't get too much sleep last night but still was awake enough to participate in class and do pretty well um so just went to my class and got my work done and had time to start on some homework that due later in the week and had little bit of time to study for my test on wednesday and plan to study for while tomorrow in preparation for that same test um had meeting with my professor about math which felt was really helpful to making sure that i'm preparing well for the upcoming assignments and for the algebra gateway retake so that went really well um finally got around to getting some of my reading done [just] for for my other class and should be getting that back [with] some grades later in the week which should give me better idea about my standing and how well i'm doing in my class so far have few other assignments that are also gonna be due this week but hopefully after the test on wednesday i'll have plenty of time to work on them um do have two work shifts that i'm not too excited about but i'll get them done and they'll probably take like two hours each so won't be too bad and one will be good amount of money and other than that need to set up meeting with my academic advisor and really need to set up meeting with huhs to see about going to chiropractor so we'll see how the week goes today woke up late so thought about skipping class but in the end got ready and went but it was worth it because needed to take notes of the material to be prepared fully during the week um after class had to sneak off to my room and started doing some homework um and was really was really bit worried about test that have tomorrow because haven't really had time to study for it over the weekend sort of lot of drama [inaudible] so really didn't get much studying done and then yesterday had some other stuff that had to do so couldn't study for it then and then today tried to study for it in all of my free time but got lot of information from the people back home which took bigger portion of my day and had to leave to do few other things for some different class and there was also some more drama with my roommate and it was her sort of interrupting while i'm trying to study and things like that that make it more difficult for me to focus and actually get it done so feel pretty unprepared for the exam but i'm just gonna go to bed and try and get good night sleep and do the best that can on the exam tomorrow it is the first exam so should be able to do better later in the semester or try and make up for it if don't do so well tomorrow um and maybe next time i'll take more time [inaudible] the office hours or do do the exam prep sessions so we'll just have to see in the end how it go so the rest of the week is looking pretty busy as well today overall has been all right woke up little bit late so didn't has as much time to get ready for my exam as wanted um the exam overall went okay but do wish had studied little bit more because there was one problem specifically that hadn't had time to look over so i'm pretty sure didn't do it correctly um but guess we'll just see how it goes and it is only the first test so hopefully it will still work out okay um managed to get quite bit of my homework done because has long work shift tomorrow so wanted to make sure finished it [inaudible] so i've spent the majority of my day doing homework and it was pretty nice because now feel lot less stressed about tomorrow um also managed to actually goes to the dining hall for lunch and dinner so made sure to eat good meal and i've had time to hang out with my friends as well um probably gonna stay up little bit later to watch show together but it shouldn't be too bad 'cause can sleep in little bit later 'cause don't has class right away in the morning um so i'll see how it goes i'm also going to see my counsellor tomorrow so that should hopefully help me feel better about some things going into this weekend because still has quite few responsibilities so and heard little bit from people back home today but not as much as would has liked to they're still being really supportive and my sister will be flying up here in like 10 day so i'll get to see her and spend some time with her which should help quite bit so today was definitely busy day um woke up on time to get ready and go to class but was little frustrated um just because of how my roommate woke me up um class went just fine and had section and everything that went well got good grade back so was pretty happy about that um was little bit frustrated um just because won't know about some other grade until tomorrow and i'm really worried about them and then was so stressed out that ended up missing doctor appointment that had so had to reschedule it for next week and had really long work shift that ended up working from 630 to 1130 and coming back finishing my homework then just staying up for bit to shower and unwind so i'm going to be pretty late but don't have too many class tomorrow just have lot of appointment and things that have to get done tomorrow and saturday but i'm planning also for downtime to relax on saturday as well going to game with my friends um and today was good because talked to some new people and went to dinner with new friends so sort of changed my routine which was nice to have some different people to talk to um probably also need to clean bunch this weekend because my room is pretty messy but we'll see how it go today went fairly well was little bit stressed out about test that didn't do as well as i'd like to on but also got another assignment back from another class that scored much better on than thought would which sort of brightened my day and had meeting with my academic adviser and he really helped me to see that the one bad test grade doesn't really matter that much because can make it up and it wasn't even that bad it was just that felt poorly about it um also had meeting to go check in for [inaudible] and that went really well and then had meeting with [inaudible] so not chiropractor so she gave me some tips and then referred me to physical therapy but won't be able to go until like the 16th so might try and get another appointment with some actual chiropractor for sooner than that um i'm pretty sore doesn't feel too well because i've had too many work shifts which i'm gonna have to do two work shifts tomorrow morning um and also wanna go to the game with some friends so we'll see how that go because have to get everything done between 800 and before 1200 since the game at 1200 and so guess if doesn't finish my work in time i'll just have to go to the game late so i'll be getting up pretty early but tonight i'll be relaxing with friends and we got some food to eat so it should be really nice today was okay woke up and had an early shift with work um wasn't feeling too well 'cause fell on an stairs the other day so my other job they let me just take this week off um sent message to my healthcare provider to see about going to see chiropractor so can hopefully get that taken care of so that they will be easier to walk around and make they to classes all week long have quite few assignments over the weekend but really didn't get any of them done today spent part of the day working and spent part of the day at the game and then spent the rest of the day pretty much cleaning my room and then going to the birthday party of friend which was all right but pretty stressful just 'cause they was very social environment and my roommate and aren't exactly getting along um so they does an stuff that make me feel really anxious and out of place which made they worse but for bit was separated and got to talk to few other people in my [entryway] which was nice and then left early to come back to my room and have an alone time to sort of destress tomorrow i'm planning on getting up early and just focusing on homework for while but i'm really looking forward to this weekend 'cause my sister will be coming and so hopefully it'll be better today slept in late and spent most of the day by myself my roommate wanted to go do few things but really just felt like being alone um didn't really feel like doing much work so just worked on art for while to help myself relax [finished] some some assignments um and then toward the end of the evening actually did my work and got quite bit of it done was able to concentrate so well because spent most the day alone didn't have any other distractions in the room with me my week is looking pretty busy um tomorrow in particular my [inaudible] full and have some upcoming exam thursday night but feel like i'm pretty well prepared for it uh i'll but i'll have to drop shift at work in order to be able to take it so hopefully my manager gets back to me about that sometime soon because i'll need to know um other than that i'm really looking forward to this weekend because my sister is coming to visit but i'm not looking forward to friday 'cause have major assignments due and i'm still really not sure how to start it so i'll probably gets that started tuesday evening and just see how it go from there have few other assignments due this week but nothing as major as the one that due friday so we is trying to [inaudible] that one my priority and hopefully the other assignments won't take me too long today woke up on time and made it to all of my classes which were pretty much just what expected um kind of [have] lot of assignments due this week but i've been keeping up with it okay today didn't really get much done because have so many classes that it makes me really not feel like doing any work even had to start another classes today were the first meeting that lasted an hour and it give me two more hour of work outside of classes which means i'll be pretty busy have work friday night and saturday morning and i'm planning on working tomorrow for my other job have test on thursday but feel like i'm pretty ready for it um today were nice 'cause went to lunch with an different people from my entryway that don't normally hang out with um it went fine and then had classes and friend from the that classes that went to and made plans to go and get lunch together on wednesday so it'll be someone else to hang out with as well and went to counseling today which were really nice i'm going back again on thursday so hopefully that'll help and were really glad 'cause got to talk on the phone with someone from back home for while so we'll see how everything go this morning woke up on time to even go get breakfast [before] class so it started out better than it usually does um my day was fairly busy almost forgot had an evening class but then remembered and still managed to make it on time was little bit out of it and i've just sort of been depressed so really wasn't able to does my homework and my roommate kind of made that worse and complained about me not spending time with them so instead of doing my homework decided to spend time with my roommate which resulted in me not finishing my homework until 300 in the morning and going to bed late because have an 800 am class so [inaudible] right now and know that i'm gonna have to work really hard tomorrow to make up for it since i've quite few assignments due this week and still have test um thursday evening that i'm not really ready for but think think it should still be all right even if don't study as much as wanted to managed to work an today which was really nice and thursday have an appointment with my counselor which should be good and my sister coming this weekend so hopefully the week will start looking up just need to actually go to bed on time so we'll see today was difficult ended up waking up almost late for my class um but still managed to get there on time and class went alright thought about skipping one 'cause was really tired but went anyway and then later came back and napped and then managed to get to my other class in time and then spent the after the afternoon by myself which was nice but at the same time feel like i've sorta gotten more down and haven't been focused on [inaudible] really fully doing my homework or pay attention in class which is bad because this week is pretty busy but think [inaudible] helping [inaudible] with my roommate [inaudible] making it worse because when [inaudible] it makes me not wanna do my work and it constantly want to do other things like watch tv when really need to be concentrating it makes it hard for me to focus um i'm going to counseling tomorrow so that should help but i'm just [inaudible] really anxious and depressed so we'll see i'm really hoping that my sister coming this week it'll help and talked to my grandmother on the phone today for bit which was nice but then was super more stressed from home from my mom with some trouble that been going on with my dad and my brother so overall i'm pretty stressed out and i'm thinking about going to bed without finishing my work and was trying to get it done tomorrow before have to go to class so i'm gonna see how it go and hopefully can go to bed sometime soon 'cause my roommate currently in there watching show so we'll see how long it takes before i'm able to go to sleep today was all right um didn't really get enough sleep again so was kinda falling asleep in class but it turned out okay and was happy because got like good grade on paper um got lot of stuff due uh tomorrow which is why stayed up so late tonight and didn't even finish it all and so i'm just gonna email one of my tfs and the other one is not due until 900 pm tomorrow so hopefully i'll find some time to finish it i'm worried about getting up on time for class but know that can probably drag myself there on time so it should be okay overall um [inaudible] this evening which didn't go as well as wanted it to but definitely better than the last one um just have to get through tomorrow and then i'll have the weekend so should be able to relax little bit and have doctor appointment about going to see chiropractor so [inaudible] definitely help me with my overall stress and should [hem] me help me start feeling lot better uh physically as well as mentally so we'll see how it go this morning woke up and didn't feel too well so went back to sleep and ended up sleeping through all of my classes um which was unfortunate but went to the doctor and got note so it should work out just fine where can get grades and things missed excused and also have friends in all of the classes that can give me the note that missed and things like that um did spend the day doing some homework and then had actual work later in the evening so still felt pretty productive after went to the doctor and got referral to some actual chiropractor so hopefully can go sometime next week because called this evening but it didn't call me back um we'll see and have pre-midterm next week which i'm little bit worried for but there study session that can go to with some friends so should just be able to do that to prepare for it and other than that don't really have any major assignments that are due so should turn out just fine today had shift of work so woke up pretty early um it was kinda difficult because it was raining and there was quite few people out in the yard still um but managed to make it through uh after that basically spent the day cleaning up my room and trying to get some stuff organized and taking shower um and then later my sister came in and we went to concert together which was really nice but i'm still having some issues with my roommate don't know she just been acting weird and i'm really stressed about school stuff so don't wanna deal with [personal] issues but still managed to relax at the concert 'cause had really awesome time it really made me feel great and tomorrow i'm gonna get up early know have lot of work to do so already have plans to work with some entryway mates and to go shopping with another friend so hopefully can get quite few things done and then be ready for the week which is gonna be pretty busy have quiz on monday and test on tuesday so we'll see how everything go today overall didn't go too well um woke up pretty late and spent the whole day trying to do homework but really couldn't focus and get any of it done and ended up getting some news from home that made me pretty upset so was just trying to avoid being upset um cleaned few things up tried to relax little bit but i'm really behind on my school work so had to email some of my tfs and try to [inaudible] few friends and in the end went to go and talk to my proctor about some stuff that been going on lately and it said that it was gonna forward the information to [inaudible] and that she could contact my teachers and everything and sort of let them know what going on also really need to go to the chiropractor but haven't heard back from them um so i'll be calling again tomorrow to try and set up some appointment for some time this week and hopefully they're resolved and also have two work shifts this week which shouldn't be too bad overall and have quiz tomorrow that i'm pretty worried about i'm not really sure how it gonna go and then have test on tuesday that i'm also really worried about so i'll just have to see how

overall was pretty good woke up on time made it to all of my classes had [inaudible] so it went lot better than expected it to [firstly] because part of it was group portion and got to collab with other people in the classes that have similar ideas to me which was really nice um was little unprepared for my lab but think went through fine and managed to get some help on the [inaudible] which

which was sad but can do corrections and make better grade and now i'll be working with the tutor so hopefully i'll do better in the future and tomorrow i'm planning on getting up pretty early and going shopping with friend so that should be pretty nice other than that um talked to some of my family back home because i've been pretty upset about my cousin and few other things and it helped especially since won't be able to go to my counselor for two weeks so talking to people at home really helps um but also got to talk to my friend that haven't spoken to since basically since left home and moved here so that was really fun and we made plans to hang out over christmas break when we're both home um and talked about some of my other friend so hopefully we'll all get together think really can't wait for break to be able to see everyone again back home and take some time with the friend that i'm i'm used to and i'm close with so today was fine um slept way too late last night so woke up kind of late this morning and spent basically the entire day out shopping with friend of mine um spent little bit more money than wanted to it was all basically essential stuff so feel okay about it still um was pretty tired from all of that so came back slept for bit then did laundry which was frustrating because the dryer broke so my clothes didn't get dry so had to hang them all over my room um then spent the rest of the evening with my friend and we watched some scary movies which kind of freaked me out and then my roommate got back home way later and was sort of weird about it but didn't really [inaudible] and then um another friend was nice enough to come over and hang out with me so we ended up staying up too late again and have quite bit of homework need to get done and i'm pretty upset about the grade on my um pre-midterm but my teacher emailed me about meeting and trying to go over the problems so i'll do that and then we're gonna try and arrange to meet with my um

bit which was nice and my [inaudible] just checked in to see how was doing talked to some friends from back home and some family members from back home which was pretty nice um other than that am little worried about the week it pretty busy have lot of appointments and just realized double-booked some time next week so have to try and get that sorted i'm only working two shifts for one of my jobs which isn't too bad so i'm [inaudible] don't have to cover anything and other than that i'd really like to have monday off because it like don't know more time to relax and should have focused on homework little more but it won't be too hard to catch up during the week uh i'll just be pretty busy so i'll see how it goes i'm planning on getting up pretty early tomorrow um so can turn in my homework before going to class [hopefully] i'll make it on time to turn in my homework after class so it not too big deal so it should turn out all right today went really well was on time to class was able to talk to one of the guys from my class about my presentation so felt pretty good about that thought it was gonna be really bad but hope not so just have to wait on that one longer went to the chiropractor and the doctor see is really awesome we talked for while and she gave me some tips on how to stay in better shape um and my back and everything feels lot better today um got to talk to my grandmother on the phone for while which was really nice and did stay up little bit too late doing homework but it just because i'm worried about presentation have on thursday i'm meeting with the tutor for the class tomorrow though so it should turn out all right um class today was really interesting and tomorrow have some early class that i'm not too excited about but it shouldn't be too bad also got to work with my math tutor today which helped lot and got set up with my science tutor which i'm excited about because feels like i'll start doing lot better in both of that class once begin meeting with the tutor so overall it been going pretty well and actually went out to dinner um for the first time in while to [inaudible] normally just stay in my room and eat so that was nice as well today went fairly well was few minutes late to class but it wasn't too bad and understood everything that it talked about during lecture which was really nice um also got back really good grade today which made me happy have presentation tomorrow that i'm little bit worried about but also met with the tf to go over it which made me feel little bit more confident about it and made some plans to study because have three tests next week with some other people who are in similar class to me um also have plans to hang out with friend on friday which should be nice and we should be having some people over um to our room tomorrow night and friday night and maybe on saturday and sunday so it looks like it will be pretty busy but it will be nice to relax and hang out with people while also still getting work done since midterms are next week um i'm pretty confident about one of our midterms the other two i'm kind of worried about but started going to tutor so that should help um also have counseling on monday which i'm looking forward to and have work shift tomorrow evening that i'm not super excited about but hopefully it won't be too bad and can get it done fairly quickly and still have time to do homework and hang out with some friend so and i'm not i'm pretty busy but i'm still finding time to relax because know otherwise i'll just get way too stressed out and not get anything done today was pretty good woke up on time for class um and got dressed up since had presentation today which also went really well um my tf really liked it hope get good grade um and started preparing for my midterms so feel little more confident in those um 'cause have three next week it will definitely be busy weekend i'm working two shifts so those should be fun but i'm going to get coffee with friend tomorrow which will be really nice so overall everything going pretty well i'm definitely gonna study lot in preparation for my midterms so hopefully they'll end up being just fine but we'll see other than those um have an appointment next week to meet with my advisor which will be really nice which just scheduled and then i'm also gonna make an appointment to get an points back on my math pre-midterms since didn't do super well on it but i'm doing better than expected in science stayed up way too lat-late tonight so debating skipping my 900 am tomorrow but if wake up on time i'll probably be going or just going to it little bit late i'll just have to get ready really quickly so hopefully i'll still make it because really need to stop missing those class i've already missed twice today was all right slept through my morning class 'cause slept too late last night but went to all of my other class which was really good and started preparing more for my midterms um spent some time shopping with my friends um we had little get-together tonight and got to hang out with one of my friends from my hometown we went out for coffee and then he came over later to hang out and it was really nice because haven't seen him in while and he just really good person to talk to and to be friends with um other than that we really didn't see anyone and probably stayed up way too late again 'cause have shift in the morning and then have [inaudible] [dorm crew] but should be able to get all of it done and then i'm really gonna focus on studying for midterms and my homework then i'm meeting with tutor on sunday and i'm meeting with the my advisor and probably the dean next week and have counseling session on monday that i'm looking forward to so just after after next week hopefully everything will calm down little bit because won't be as busy once finish all my midterms so then this week it will definitely be really stressful but then after that hopefully i'll get little break today was fine spent most of the day hanging out with friends um didn't really spend lot time doing homework and spent lot of time doing work work which still haven't even been paid for which is kind of frustrating 'cause could really use the money especially 'cause my friends wanna go shopping and don't really have the means to right now and still need to get winter coat and boots think i'm gonna have to quit one of my two jobs because it totally been too much lately um we went to party tonight which was fun but also just like still didn't really talk to anyone because it was like smaller get-together so hopefully in the future i'll go to bigger one um but it was still pretty enjoyable thing and have lot of midterms comings up so uh tomorrow i'm definitely gonna spend my day studying um hopefully don't sleep in too la-late i'm gonna set some alarms so that get up and have meeting with my proctor still meeting with my tutor and uh going to [inaudible] together so hopefully we'll do all of that and can get like caught up with my work and be little prepared because thought was prepared for some of midterms but then when looked up at the study guides realized that there some stuff that i'm really not ready for um feel like i'm falling behind in my classes little bit but like hopefully i'll catch up and just wanna get through these midterms and then it'll hopefully get better for while so hoping my roommate okay and i'm meeting with my counselor monday so can like talk thing through with her but really just think need to expand my circle of friends so we'll see how it go but tomorrow hopefully i'll i'll actually do like lot of work and everything today was fine uh some people to go [inaudible] one of the problems that for class which was really nice kinda struggled with another problems set for different class but in the the end figured it out pretty much uh with help from the friends studied little bit for my midterms should study more but spent more time catching up with friends that hadn't seen in while which was really nice because feel like that help me to be in better place mentally when hang out with some other friends um so it was really fun we got to bake and haven't been able to cook anything for at least like [half] year so it was pretty relaxing um other than that really slept in too today because was up really late last night so it makes sense and hopefully after get through this week everything will calm down because midterms will be over have [allowed] for around [inaudible] too and then the week is pretty busy overall with appointments and other things um suppose just need to power through it and then hopefully everything will calm down go back to more regular schedule where won't be as stressed today was my busy day um had lot of classes [since i'm in] lab which was fine but it was also [quite bad] because needed time to study and slept too late last night which do lot lately other than that getting ready for my test this week but have little bit of time tomorrow to prepare and even if we go [inaudible] have options to like make it better and find other ways to deal with stuff um so hopefully overall it won't be like too hard or anything um the rest of the week is still pretty busy but i'll just be relieved to be over with all my midterms by thursday and after that think i'll take few day to relax and then go back to studying so can be prepared for future assignments and the final which is like project coming up uh two mondays from now so i'll probably start working on that um during next week and my sister will be coming for parents weekend so definitely wanna finish early today was fine made it to all of my classes um was definitely pretty stressed out because have midterm tomorrow that i'm really not ready for but did well on my other test and i've been doing well [on other] [inaudible] even if do poorly on this midterm should still be fine for the semester overall especially if do better on the last two test we have and have two more midterm thursday also have work shift because couldn't get it covered and have two meetings thursday so thursday so thursday is definitely looking pretty busy and then friday is little bit calmer so i'll probably do work shift friday and then two work shift on saturday and then relax this weekend before diving back in and doing more work but it will have come down because i'll be finished with all my test after this week so hopefully everything will get better and got to talk to my counselor yesterday and made another appointment and i'm going to physical therapy next week so it should probably help me get better and think i'm gonna quit one of my jobs so have more time to focus on school and and allow me to work my other jobs because just got raise so if do like four hours there week i'll be making pretty good money and it won't stress me out as much as my second jobs do so hopefully that'll help and my meetings with my academic advisor should definitely help as well because he always very straightforward and gives really good advice so hopefully everything will get better just once i'm passed all this testing today was fine woke up on time and got to study little bit before my midterm um it went better than expected it to but not still too well had to [twist up] clues which went okay i'm just little tired and [not too focused] so um yesterday made it to classes and got quite bit of studying done so hopefully i'm fairly prepared for my midterm tomorrow um tomorrow going to be quite

730 every day and we'll see how that go so in the morning i'll have some time to prepare and get some breakfast and coffee maybe before finding my way to my first midterm of the day and then have some meetings and then i'll have my second midterm then work so it definitely busy day but it just today and then mean tomorrow that i'm probably gonna have to get through and then the week will be over so hopefully everything ends up just all right today had two midterms the one in the morning went fine the one in the uh evening didn't go so well and got got bit upset but quit my second job so i'll have less stress so can focus on school and be more prepared for the rest of the semester my sister coming next weekend don't know if [i'm looking forward to it] and she probably gonna bring me some winter clothes which will be really nice because thought was gonna have buy some new stuff but now won't have to um other than that also met with my academic advisor today and he made me really

gonna end up staying here for thanksgiving break but that okay 'cause can just go to new york for thanksgiving to meet up with my sister and it'll be nice and then i'll be going back home for christmas we're [talking] about booking flight um so hopefully can get around to that sometime soon um i'm gonna try to go to bed early even though my [inaudible] probably [inaudible] but want to get up early in the morning 'cause i'm trying to stick to new schedule that getting up at 730 and going to bed at midnight so hopefully i'll do that and i'll be fine and then this weekend i'll have some time to relax and party and also get caught up on some school work going into the week um shouldn't have too much homework so it should all end up being okay today wasn't feeling too well but still made it to all my classes and did everything important that needed to do and was gonna go to work but since wasn't feeling well decided to sleep for while um feel little better but not much and have two shifts of work tomorrow so i'm going to bed finally but still have to get up early and do the shifts and may end up just sleeping more also need to try and get some homework done but guess wanna see how feel how sick am or not and decide whether or not to get my homework done from that my sister coming next week which is exciting also have to try and um ship package for my other sister because her birthday is coming up next weekend talked to my best friend tonight and haven't heard from him in probably like two months so that was really nice and hope that we can talk again and i'm supposed to call my sister tomorrow morning while i'm at work hopefully my work shifts is easy 'cause probably still won't be feeling well and i'm gonna have to get up really early because have to get it done before 1100 so i'll need to get up at like 730 and go to work by 800 but should still be able to finish it so i'll see how it go today was pretty good but um woke on time because had two work shifts did both of those um spent quite bit of the day relaxing i've got all the homework done and spent time with cleaning and reorganizing my room which really made me feel better so it was nice um spent the evening out partying with friends it was pretty fun but have to wake up early tomorrow to [help me] with tutor that'll be good 'cause it'll help me get all my homework done and to make sure it right um hopefully i'll spend the rest of the day prepping for my other classes those don't have tutor for uh uh and we'll see how it goes i'm glad those don't have any work tomorrow 'cause i'm really tired did something to hurt my foot so it kinda hurt to walk on and i'm not really sure why but don't know mean it not too bad so um feel okay and i'm just waiting to get my paycheck because haven't been paid yet and i'm running little bit low on cash so hopefully my manager pays me sometime soon today was fine work up little late so was few minutes late to my meeting this morning but it wasn't bad um had quite bit of my homework done pretty early on but then kinda lost motivation throughout the day and was really being little lazy but still finished everything by reasonable time and i'm having some problems with my bank so was having to deal with that and try and plan for the week 'cause my sister is gonna be coming so have to get assignments and work done earlier so that have time to hang out with her and everything um actually made it to annenberg today for lunch and dinner um which was nice and also went to brain break and got little snack and ran into friend which was cool but sometimes just wish that spent little less time with my roommate and my one constant friend because [inaudible] kinda frustrating um struggled little bit on the math homework and in the end figured it out but my roommate didn't and she [inaudible] [bad mood] and her and my friend is both sick and so really hope that my roommate sick because don't really have time for that since have to stay on top of everything and when my sister comes she supposed to be bringing me some winter coats and things like that which will be really nice 'cause then don't have to buy her all and hopefully get paid some time soon for my other job because i've worked there for two months now and still haven't been paid and that actually the job quit so have one last shift on thursday night which is poor timing 'cause that when my sister will be here but she said she'll do it with me so we'll see how that work out but hopefully it pay me soon because really need to put the money in the bank especially since i'm having some issues with the storage [inaudible] in my car and [inaudible] so today was long day have bunch of classes uh was almost late to my first 'cause didn't know there was construction in the yard managed to turn my set on time and to classes on time um second classes went by just fine was just little bit sleepy then got to grab some lunch before going to third classes which was nice and then had lot of time to relax and get some work done and talk to my family before went to my next classes and it was pretty stressful because [inaudible] is lab so it takes really long time um my group kept having things happen made us takes even longer and then my tf even messed up the end of my experiment so we might not even be able to use the results and was pretty exhausted after that so got dinner and took nap but my alarm didn't go off so ended up sleeping for like five hours which means that have to stay up later preparing for my classes tomorrow tomorrow is gonna be pretty busy day so i'm gonna try and get up early do some homework maybe get breakfast and go to classes and i've gotta run by the mail center get few things off work shift at my job and then um have some appointment before my evening classes so it will be pretty busy and then i've got pretty long math assignment but can get some help on it with my roommate and my other friend so it should be okay today was okay really didn't sleep well last night 'cause was not feeling well and was just too [keyed] up to sleep but still went to class on time and everything and it was really interesting um went to work for bit that went really poorly just had lot of complications so i'm going to work again tomorrow for another hour to fill my two hour for this week uh hurt my foot so it really hard to walk right now but hopefully it will get better before thursday because have the um my last shift for the hsa and my sister coming in talked to my counselor today it was just really nice it little frustrating because won't be able to see her for until november um it would be really really good to see her sooner than that 'cause i've definitely been pretty stressed out so [oh well] ts it definitely busy week with lost of homework but we'll just see how it goes in the end hopefully my sister coming here will help to calm me down little bit wasn't feeling too well today woke up late and got ready quickly went to class my foot was still hurting quite bit and had headache but still went to all my class and had little lunch and went to work and then um had an appointment with physical therapy which went okay but think if i've set up three more appointment but think cutting back at everything will definitely help quite bit um and now have this an exercising to do at home and was really relieved because got winter coat fund and my sister also bringing an winter coat so then should be able to save an money by not having to buy as much um other than that talked to my family about maybe changing my plane ticket so can drive back with my siblings instead but i'm not really sure um and my sister coming tomorrow tomorrow pretty busy day 'cause have quite bit of homework and uh wanna spend time with her and also have to work shift but it should be all right 'cause [can get] help on the homework and plan to do an of it during the day at least and got midterm back tonight that didn't do so great on but sort of expected that and it just i'm just gonna have to work hard to make up for it in the future and hopefully i'll get midterm back tomorrow that will be much better grade so we'll see today went well made it to my classes on time had pretty busy day doing homework [inaudible] classes and my sister came unprepared so again [inaudible] um that i'll be getting back my last midterm grade next week and then have another exam next week [inaudible] so i'll be doing quite few events um think i'm going to like five different things on saturday and sunday i've already got two things scheduled and on friday have few things scheduled um and it also going to be more tough weekend 'cause my foot been hurting so [went to] huhs and it said that probably sprained it so it gave me some crutches which am definitely having some trouble walking on but hopefully i'll get used to them pretty soon um feel like i'm gonna have to get up little earlier tomorrow in order to make it to classes on time getting ready and walking on crutches but with my sister being here it'll be super helpful um so hopefully it won't be too bad and mean should get used to it pretty quickly and am little worried about getting all my work done this weekend because know my sister being here will also be distraction but [inaudible] sunday to be able to finish up on [inaudible] if don't finish earlier than that 'cause have like guess four or five assignments to do over the weekend today was fine made it to all my classes although it was little bit difficult 'cause uh injured my ankle and had to get around on crutches it definitely harder was almost late to few classes but my teachers [everyone] was very understanding have quite bit of work to do [inaudible] next weeks [inaudible] pretty busy to with major assignment due on monday i'm getting [inaudible] wednesday and have an exam on tuesday uh so have lab report due monday on top of my normal homework and test corrections but i'm meeting with my tutors this weekend which will definitely help out with all the homework aspect and i'm just hoping that my it get better quickly since it so hard to get around i'm um i'm probably not gonna go to [inaudible] tomorrow night 'cause i've already got quite few things planned since my sister in town [inaudible] [game] and an capella show and the orchestra so don't think i'm gonna make to dance as well because it'll hurt my ankle too much but today was really nice because got to relax after my classes and stay off it for while and then went shopping with my sister and we went out to eat so tried few new places and had an really delicious food which was really lovely [inaudible] been eating well since [inaudible] i'm really glad that she is here and that she'll be here until sunday morning so i'll probably get all my homework done on sunday but it'll be worth it to take break and to spend time with her while she here today was all right went to quite few events like the football game the fellowship was really awesome the orchestra was pretty good too little bit longer than wanted then went to party with my friends but they didn't wanna stay as late as did which kinda sucked but don't know maybe next weekend we can stay out little bit later 'cause was having pretty good time um other than that know have lot of homework to do tomorrow so might go to bed and i'm probably gonna get up around 1000 1030 'cause have an appointment at 1100 with my tutor to go over an [inaudible] stuff know i've definitely stayed on my ankle little bit too much this evening but hopefully it'll get better pretty quickly and i'm gonna ice they when go to bed which should help little bit at least um other than that think i'm gonna try and make an more friends 'cause really want people than can like trust to go out with and have quite few assignments due on monday so i'll be doing quite bit of homework tomorrow but past that need to plan for thanksgiving 'cause i'll be going to stay with my sister and her boyfriend instead of going home 'cause they too expensive to go home but just kinda regret they because wish could just be here having good time with good friends that trust so really need to find an people that actually trust but don't know how that'll happen 'cause i'm too anxious but hopefully my counselor will help me with they so we'll see how they go today wasn't feeling too well so spent most of the day relaxing woke up pretty early showered met with my tutor to go over some stuff which was nice but then after that kind of just laid around for while and ended up taking nap because i'm not feeling well um my foot is really hurting so tomorrow think i'm gonna try [inaudible] so that it'll be little bit easier to get around [inaudible] won't be as difficult [inaudible] to so hopefully it'll just be fine like that hopefully my [foot] will get better pretty soon because i'm mean i'm taking medicine which helps and if it doesn't get better then [inaudible] um other than that do have quite bit of homework to do tomorrow um as had lot tonight that didn't really finish [inaudible] since spent most of the day laying around but [inaudible] 'cause have some assignment due by 900 pm i'm thinking about skipping one of my classes to work on it but think i'll probably still go to classes and then just try and get it done 'cause should still have about five hours [and it only like] two pages so it shouldn't be too difficult to finish um other than that i'm kinda busy this week but it shouldn't be too bad hopefully [inaudible] [will be] easier before it get harder today it went all right woke up on time with everything but wasn't feeling well 'cause my foot is still pretty sore and think i'm fighting with my roommate right now 'cause she been gone all day and hasn't come back um other than that uh today hasn't [inaudible] 'cause it been long day so did them all and other than that had an assignment that was due at 900 pm but still managed to finish it just on time it just little under the word limit but it was flexible so it should be all right have an exam later this week that don't really feel ready for but i'm meeting with my tf tomorrow so that should help um other than that just hope get feeling better um maybe i'll go to the show [inaudible] in performance it friday but don't have anyone to go with so let me see i'll see what happens today was fine um only had two classes which was nice um [inaudible] was kinda falling asleep in the first classes 'cause stayed up little too late last night probably stayed up too late tonight as well but have time for little nap tomorrow um do have [inaudible] 'cause have 900 am and it might be kinda busy after that hope if get my homework done early that should go to bed early which would definitely help um and other than that i'm getting mid-term back tomorrow and think did really well on it so i'm sort of excited for that and ch it was little bit difficult 'cause had talk with my [inaudible] 'cause i've been having some problems her and my other friend am [inaudible] probably all of it will just blow over went to haunted house which was fun but it was pretty scary and tried to make thanksgiving plans and christmas plans with my family which am slowly being worked out but just so stressful [as is] and don't know where i'll go to [inaudible] this week probably on friday or saturday since my foot is still really hurting from spraining my ankle but don't think can get any more time off 'cause already missed shift few week ago so see i'll probably just [inaudible] and taking some advil so my [foot don't hurt] too badly today was fine got back midterm that did really well on so was super happy about that and have kind of lot of homework but managed to get it done and got started on few other things do have test tomorrow that i'm little bit worried about but should have time to study before it um 'cause only have two other classes to go to um and in my other classes i'm gonna try and get up early in the morning so can finish some extra readings for that but it my favorite classes so it won't be too bad today was pretty tired so did end up sleeping through one of my other classes but hopefully can make up the work for it tomorrow night and my ankle is still hurting pretty bad so i'll probably try and do my shift with my work on either friday the day after my last classes or saturday um friday night i'm also going to friend concert which is gonna be really fun and had dinner with her this evening so i'm super excited about being able to go i'm gonna see her again on friday 'cause dinner tonight was really nice um and talked while with my family back home and tried to make some concrete plans for thanksgiving so hopefully get paid for my other job soon so can buy train ticket to go see my sister today had my favorite class which was really nice um and also made an appointment with huhs tomorrow to go get my foot looked at since it still been hurting other than that um had test this evening and think it went fine probably could have done better if looked over an more stuff but don't think that it [inaudible] test so hopefully still did okay though um got my homework done pretty quickly and stayed up watching an tv when really should have been working on an other stuff other than that found out that might actually be going home for thanksgiving which i'm pretty excited about um but still have to work out few of the details with my family and i'm also super happy 'cause i'm going to the [inaudible] with friend tomorrow so that'll be lots of fun today woke up late and ended up sleeping through my first class but it shouldn't be too bad because can definitely make it up pretty easily since the lecture is recorded online um went to all of my class did quite bit of my reading and started some of my homework for this weekend so i'd say my day was really productive and also [inaudible] [to address] something in my special shoe where sprained my foot don't know how much i'm really going to wear it though because it not super comfortable and have work tomorrow so i'm definitely not going to wear it during work but i'll probably only do about two hours since my foot hurting so i'll just have to fulfill the requirement and then i'll probably spend the rest of the day trying to do homework and then have plans to go to some acapella show tomorrow evening and some of the people in my [inaudible] is going to be in it tonight or tomorrow is the performance but girl from my [dorm crew] was in it and it was super good and it was [inaudible] because went with my friend from back home and haven't seen him in few weeks so that was definitely fun and we made sort of made plans to go to the december one together as well so i'll be looking forward to that and i'm excited because think i'm going to get to go home for thanksgiving now and didn't think was going to so hopefully everything will work out and i'll figure out all my thanksgiving plans soon and i'm going to try and go winter clothes shopping sometime soon as well maybe this weekend today woke up late and my foot was really hurting so ended up not going to work and texted my manager but she didn't answer which was little bit frustrating um really wasn't feeling good so kind of just relaxed at home did leave to go to [redacted] and to go pick up some bagged food from the dining hall um which was nice because their bagged lunches are really great and even ordered one for tomorrow morning so hopefully can [just] pick it up on time um i'm also hosting someone but it interesting 'cause she stays out late and doesn't respond which means that have to stays up later than want to as well but she leaving tomorrow so it shouldn't be too bad um tomorrow i'm gonna start tutoring which will definitely help with some of my homework um then the week gonna be super busy but i'm super excited 'cause i'll be getting to go home for thanksgiving now which will be really nice was hoping to get in today but woke up and wasn't feeling too well my throat really sore so think might be getting sick now and i'm gonna try and go to bed early 'cause finished all my homework pretty early which will be nice 'cause i'm i'm probably gonna have trouble waking up tomorrow so just haven't been feeling well um tomorrow also my really busy day so it kind of sucks that i'm gonna be sick when have the most classes and the most stuff to do also have meeting tomorrow at the [bsc] and i'm still waiting to get back some news of the test which hopefully went well um think it went okay think it could've gone better but still think i'm okay um some of the homework had little bit of trouble with but still finished all of it so i'm still feeling pretty proud of myself for finishing um and other than that i'm looking forward to my on tuesday there are some classes and i'm happy because started doing packed lunches with [hohs] and with um [heds] so i've been able to actually eat food quite bit more like got the hummus and beef and it wasn't as good as back home but it was still pretty good and um ordered lunches for tomorrow as well so can make sure that continue eating when don't have time to actually sit down and have lunches in the dining hall so i'll probably continue to use them because it really great service and hopefully my foot get better and my throat will get better soon because i'm really tired of being sick today was my busy day um finished with [inaudible] sort of on time read it pretty quickly and was almost late to turn it in because [inaudible] but still managed to make it which was good um perhaps it fine went to bed early last night 'cause wasn't feeling well but was definitely feeling better today i'm still not 100 i'm definitely better than was yesterday um [inaudible] so life is getting better and my manager replied so went to see [inaudible] work which was nice um was little stressed out because found out that have two tests next week and thought only had one and [inaudible] just gonna to try [inaudible] also have lot of papers coming up that we should be getting an assignment for either tomorrow or thursday um i'm supposed to have meeting today but it canceled in the last minute so had to reschedule that for wednesday and have two more meeting tomorrow um one with physical therapy which will be interesting because it will be my first time working with them and the other with my counselor which was really nice since i've begun to see them [inaudible] um hopefully we can be productive 'cause normally we run out of time to talk about things um other than that talked to my mom today which was really nice 'cause she looking forward to coming home for thanksgiving um so just my grandmother [inaudible] [out] and surprised them but [inaudible] tell them checking the news definitely made them happier and [inaudible] can [inaudible] something to look forward to 'cause really need break from the atmosphere and the people here but uh i'm trying to [inaudible] tomorrow when we get breakfast but don't have time but depending on how feel in morning might just decide need the extra sleep so we'll see today didn't wake up as early as wanted but still woke up in plenty of time to get to class and class was super interesting so was really glad um after that had little bit of time to do my reading and eat pretty good lunch um because still have food from the packed lunch i've been getting ordered two for tomorrow but won't be able to pick them up until one o'clock because of my busy schedule which is little annoying but it fine um whatever um other than that had meeting with my therapist which was really awesome really enjoy talking to them and she always understands me um and had meeting with pt for the first time which was definitely bit of struggle but think it'll be really nice to start building up more strength and feel more comfortable and confident with myself um especially because it going to help my back and think overall i'm going to be lot happier and it'll make it lot easier to function in everyday life um what else have two tests next week which am not too thrilled because don't feel like i'm ready for either of them got tests back today um but didn't do too great on it so we'll just see how it goes mean should have time to study over the weekend and can meet with my two groups of friends to help so that will be nice today was fine and i'm definitely getting sick so ended up sleeping through my first period class um but it-it definitely not gonna be like too hard to make up because they have the lectures online and everything um so they okay that um stay and still went to all my other class was at meeting with the [redacted] state council which was pretty nice and they had some good tips on how to prepare because have two exams next week that am totally gonna need lot of time to study for um stayed up little too late trying to work on [inaudible] assignment that i'm not exactly fond of but definitely have time to finish they tomorrow um just have to focus and get they done and tomorrow only have uh two no three class um so they won't be too bad to go to all of them even though i'm not feeling well probably just won't be able to talk as much which won't be too bad but do have some questions for my tf so hopefully can still talk enough to ask them questions i've just been drinking lot of tea and doing lot of cough drops to try to make they better but think also need to get some medicine so might try and run by the store tomorrow if have time to get some honey and some medicine and maybe some more cough drops and maybe some soup um 'cause being sick definitely they not but luckily have off work this week because sprained my ankle um so hopefully i'll be better before have to go back to work next week and before have all of my exams next week and i'm gonna try and sleep they off little more this weekend today was not the best i've gotten really sick and basically lost my voice uh had trouble in classes and i'm just not feeling well so was having trouble doing [inaudible] 'cause really just wanted to lay around and not do anything but [inaudible] tomorrow um so hopefully can get that taken care of and and sleep i'm gonna sleep in tomorrow and not go to my first classes 'cause keep waking up from coughing and i've had like three nose bleeds now so don't don't wanna like go to classes and then get nose bleeds in the middle of classes um so i'm probably have to go to [inaudible] to make up but feel like that the better option it not [inaudible] trying to go to classes while feel horrible um so i'll probably email my professor tomorrow evening there one classes that have to go [inaudible] section but it only an hour um really don't have to talk that much so that should be okay uh other than that talked to my tutor today about getting one of my assignments rescheduled um and he said he'll try work on it which will be nice 'cause was pretty worried about it and then i'm just really glad that it getting closer to me being able to go home for little bit which i'm really looking forward to feel like definitely i'm gonna need the break and the separation from people here um but to get to that point do have to get through two more exams next week and lots and lots of homework this weekend but hopefully it'll be okay and i've got long paper that [inaudible] working on so it definitely getting getting busy this morning wasn't feeling well so so ended up sleeping in and missing all three of my classes and then went to [inaudible] and they said that have bronchitis so i'm taking me some prescription medicine which will hopefully help but now have even more work to make up this weekend which sucks because also wanted to like have fun do some stuff but guess i'll really have to focus on my homework i'm definitely looking forward to thanksgiving break so think just need to power through next week and get all my shit done so over thanksgiving break can relax for bit and take some time off 'cause will still probably be sick for while and hopefully my teachers will be understanding 'cause was up coughing most of the night which was why slept in and missed my classes i'm probably gonna try and schedule meetings with my tutors uh gonna try and actually get up on time tomorrow 'cause i'm probably gonna be tired but i've got to [inaudible] so definitely got to drag myself out of bed feel like i'll definitely feel better since spent today resting mostly so hopefully tomorrow won't be too bad maybe i'll start to get my voice back which will be really nice was still sick today so woke up early from nosebleed kept feeling pretty bad on and off all day long um um called [redacted] again but they really didn't tell me anything different so i'm just gonna have to [wait] till they gets better if they doesn't go can um find bit of work to do tomorrow since haven't done anything since haven't been feeling well um 'cause have all of sudden [inaudible] things like that but hopefully i'll be able to figure they out and gets they done even though am basically pretty sick um [inaudible] run to the stores but other than that didn't really [inaudible] my bed for that matter 'cause resting and gets over they [the best] so suppose my [inaudible] is resting today was my pretty busy day um 'cause have lot of homework that needed to get done and lot of stuff to prepare for during the week but it was definitely really difficult since hadn't been feeling well and i'm still not up to 100 um [inaudible] back to being able to talk [inaudible] normal voice compared to earlier in the week but i'm still having pretty bad cough and stuffiness and it definitely [inaudible] my homework tackled as i'm having lot of trouble being able to focus and think things through and don't think [inaudible] because feel too [inaudible] to like [inaudible] and probably should have been definitely had difficulty completing and understanding my work um i'm definitely behind but hopefully as get to feeling better can get [back] caught up 'cause have two tests [inaudible] this week so i'm definitely really busy this week [inaudible] myself to get through and [inaudible] go home and take break during thanksgiving so just gotta get through this week today was great i'm still feeling pretty terrible did get back [inaudible] slightly better but have two tests coming up [inaudible] quite bit of homework and two more major assignments due next week so i'm stressed out and i'm still sick and today it kinda got worse and still went to all my classes anyway but right after that came home slept for long time which definitely put me behind my work so ended up staying up later to make up for it and know tomorrow gonna be really busy because my first exam of the week is gonna be on wednesday and have few practice [exams] need to take on top of the homework for other classes things like that um but hopefully tomorrow i'll be back on time because this morning woke up late and was supposed like [to do] my homework but have later classes tomorrow morning so guess can still sleep in little bit and be on time and ordered food so that will actually eat tomorrow um [would like] to go so that can go back to my room and try to focus and work on quite few things 'cause need to do homework during the day and then at night can study for my exam that on wednesday so just need to stick to that plan but have it gonna be hard 'cause also have an appointment with physical therapy tomorrow and haven't been able to do my exercises since i've been sick but um it should still be okay today was all right um was almost late to class but managed to make it on time um throat still [hurting] don't have time to go to huhs like i'm starting to lose my voice again which sucks um did have to go [go through] some therapy today which was tiring but pretty good [inaudible] which is nice 'cause [inaudible] and my [back] isn't doing as bad [inaudible] some exercises today um have test tomorrow and then test on thursday and bunch of assignments due [inaudible] overall [inaudible] gonna have to shop for my sister birthday 'cause i'm home for thanksgiving have to give her present and have to go to the grocery store as well so we'll see if can get everything done on time hopefully will be able to today was all right um had to wake up early because had test um but think it went slightly better than thought it was gonna go feel pretty confident that at least passed so that good um was annoyed because [i've had] emailed extra work for class tomorrow like tonight that i'm not ready to do um which definitely sucks because sort of had busy night with lots of work and i'm just extra stressed um so i'm gonna try and get that done tomorrow between class have test tomorrow night but think i'm gonna have to focus on other things which isn't necessarily the best idea however did prepare so that if did poorly again can do retest 'cause did extra work to ensure that so even if do poorly on the test tomorrow i'll have an opportunity to make it up which can definitely be nice think i'm getting slightly better [from being sick] but can't really tell um at least have [inaudible] back but kinda sucks 'cause was feeling good today so napped through one of my class that will be easy to make up for but still should've probably gone to lecture um but it okay i'm really happy 'cause have few days before [inaudible] [break] [inaudible] get to go home and see my family and take break so that'll be really nice just have to get quite few things done before can leave like shopping and packing and an assignments so we'll see how it go today went pretty well was busy but was also super grateful and had test this evening think it went better than thought that it would um talked to few of my family members today which was super nice because i'll be going home in five days and i'm really excited um made plans with friend to hang out tomorrow which should be lot of fun and then i'll still be getting errands done which is nice because have so many things to do before next week because have to prepare to go home and see everyone and take presents for some birthdays that have passed so i'll shop tomorrow have work tomorrow have class tomorrow and then have some major assignments due next monday but on saturday i'm going to the game so um probably won't do anything with that saturday but it okay because started some of my homework in advance tonight and and will probably start packing and some other stuff tomorrow night just to be extra prepared and ready to leave so i'm super excited for thanksgiving break it definitely time today was fine um woke up on time went to all my classes on time did really well in all three of them um and then went to work for two hours and had nice night with friend before came home and relaxed bit and did some homework because i'm going to the game tomorrow which will be basically all day long but then on sunday can work on some of my other homework 'cause i've got major assignments due monday and tuesday and just realized have test monday night um so quite bit of work done but after that i'll be able to relax and go home for while which will be super nice can't believe how close it is to the semester being over kind of insane but it should be all right still um hopefully mean and think i'm gonna pass all of my classes maybe not with as high grades as originally hoped but mean it period of adjustment so can always do better next semester and it only one semester of not so good grades so it doesn't matter too much and now i'll be better prepared for the future today started out well and ended up horribly um went to the game with good friend that don't get to spend lot of time with but my roommate was also there and some drama happened where we ended up getting separated and strayed with my other friend and we couldn't find my roommate so we headed back together and spent basically the whole day together and the evening and we did invite my roommate but she didn't wanna come so just hung out with my other friend and she super nice so we get along really well so we had really great time you know [inaudible] we watched [a few] movies and listened to music and she played guitar and then when came home ended up getting into some argument with my roommate over the cleanliness of the room and so the stuff that happened today has definitely really stressed me out especially because did come home with the intention of doing homework because i've got two major assignments due monday and tuesday and also has to prepare to leave for thanksgiving break on tuesday right after class so i'm not gonna has lot of time to work on that assignments otherwise um but just ended up spending most of the time arguing with my roommate so all got done was one of my science psets and still has my two major assignments due at least my little psets are done so we will try and still might get up kinda early tomorrow and finish up my two major assignments or 'cause one of them are due monday so can finish it tomorrow and get started on the second and then use some of monday to also work on the second but also need to pack and run few errands tomorrow so it'll definitely be busy day tried going to the proctors about the whole thing with my roommate but think i'm just gonna let it rest until after thanksgiving break and then see how it goes um especially since i'm going to see my therapist on monday as well so that'll probably help because she always has good suggestions on thing to do um so i'll talk to them about it bit and i'm thinking about asking them if can start taking anti-anxiety medication 'cause feel like that might help me um with lot of thing overall so we'll see how that goes and i'm also are are gonna has to set up meeting with my academic advisor which might try and schedule for monday but i'm not sure if need to work on monday so don't know yet if it'll work out the thing are i'll just figure everything out as it come up just really ready to be home and take break and see my family today was all right slept in um [inaudible] nice 'cause got some rest went shopping so got some more birthday gifts for family members back home and finished my assignment um that was due tomorrow night so can focus on my paper tomorrow 'cause only have three classes and meeting but the rest of the time i'll work on my paper 'cause finished the majority of my packing so i'll be ready to leave on tuesday but i'm kinda taking lot of stuff home so think that i'll probably just end up taking some uber to the airport other than that i'm [still fighting with my] roommate ['cause] she only came home for little bit today and haven't seen her since um but honestly don't have time to deal with it so i'm just gonna let her rest till after the spring break and [see how it goes] but can talk to my counselor about it tomorrow which will be nice other than that i'm just trying to focus on my school work today was good woke up on time although did have little bit of troubs trouble sleeping last night then made it to all my classes turned in my homework on time and felt like really understood what was going on um which was nice then had an appointment and did little bit of shopping guess the only trouble really had today was not being able to focus on this essay just 'cause it over lot and also had to pack and prepare to go home tomorrow but but stayed up little bit later to continue working on the essay and try to go to bed by 100 and then still have my whole um flight and time in the airport tomorrow to work on the essay as well which will be good like three or four hours and even if don't finish it can still work on it at home since it due at midnight and it is only eight pages double spaced um so should be able to finish it all um might just not be able to cover everything that initially wanted to cover but still think that it'll be fine that i'll make good grade on it so i'm not super worried about it i'm just really excited to be going home and see my family today was good day only had one class that had to go to before being able to leave and head back home which was super nice but did have to focus on my essay because didn't finish it before left but it was okay because took some time at the airport and on the plane to write it so it wasn't too bad did start to write little bit after got home but got it in on time and i'm feeling pretty confident about how it turned out um so that really good other than that i'm just really happy to be home with the fam again um went to see everyone had to go and see surprise my family members and stop by and even see my grandmother so i'm really excited and definitely have at least few day to not do or worry about anything and just get back into the routine of being at home um so i'm now really looking forward to relaxing today was my first full day of being at home and honestly it just so nice feels like such relief not to be at school dealing with drama and actually being able to take break for once um really enjoyed it and kinda felt like spent the day doing nothing but it was nice to just relax and not do anything and even in doing that still went to work with my family and helped out at the restaurant so didn't feels particularly productive but still managed to be little bit productive um and just made me look forward to christmas even more and having longer break and [they're] really helping me um with my [inaudible] school because i've been struggling little bit especially [inaudible] don't want to go back which is [inaudible] because of my roommate but can definitely talk to shawn and rachel was little bit disappointed with my friends here but [inaudible] my school friends was really great people so guess shouldn't let it bother me that much that i'm not really hearing from them because have all my family and i'll see even more family tomorrow and it'll kinda be hard because already know what type of questions they're gonna ask me about school and relationships but at the same time i'll be really grateful to see them because they're all super supportive and you can really just tell how much everyone cares about each other so looking forward to thanksgiving today was thanksgiving and it was all right got to see my family but some family members are not exactly pleasant to be around [at least] grandma bread still okay mean had all of the good food and got to spend time together um just feel sort of distanced from the rest of my family especially 'cause i'm not feeling well which my family members think probably have strep which are great because have lot of stuff need to do and i'm stressing about money 'cause need to get good winter coat and boots but really don't have the money for it and especially with the holidays coming up have so many family members that i'm gonna have to buy them all presents and it still makes me angry to think about how much spend on textbooks that i'm not even using now but um guess there not much can do about it so i'll just have to try and pick up few more hours when go back to school so hopefully won't be feeling sick for too much longer tomorrow think i'm gonna stay home and rest up for bit which mean anyway will suck but anyway will also be good because can hopefully get some stuff done that need to get done and even if can't get winter boots should be able to go for the winter coat so mean hopefully everything will work out in the end today spent the day doing basically absolutely nothing at home which was kind of nice to be honest um kept thinking about school work thought about doing some of it but never got around to it guess just didn't have the energy um but am feeling lot better than was so hopefully i'm finally over whatever was sick with this time 'cause i'm really tired of being sick and hopefully will stay feeling better my throat will be stop being sore by sunday when it time for me to head back to school um my family have been good but also little bit frustrating but that to be expected and tomorrow think i'm actually gonna have to get up and go into work um but i'm okay with that because should also be able to spend the day getting some stuff done mean today at least did order my winter coat so that should be arriving and hopefully it'll fit and it was pretty expensive um i'm definitely gonna need to work some extra hours at my job whenever get back to campus but that shouldn't be too bad 'cause classes am just about wrapping up so hopefully everything will be fine today was good just went to work and spent the day with my family because tomorrow am headed back to school um [inaudible] packing and doing the laundry getting ready for the day which means i'll probably be pretty tired tomorrow but should be able to sleep on the flight and still have time to work on my homework so it should turn out to be just fine and i'm looking forward to going back to school but we do only have little bit of time left which will be nice 'cause i'm ready for long break in comparison to the short thanksgiving break which was nice but long break will definitely be more fun am little bit stressed about finals 'cause have to try and take one early so that can catch my plane back home but i'm gonna try and talk to my tf about it this week hopefully it'll be okay i'm little worried because have tests monday and tuesday that i'm not necessarily ready for but hopefully it'll still go fine went back to campus today so [inaudible] and my dad traveling really didn't get much sleep last night 'cause my little sister was here [inaudible] so stayed up with her but didn't sleep [inaudible] then after we cleaned for little bit which was nice i'm [inaudible] okay but [inaudible] was not super productive um and when got back did get few things done [inaudible] 'cause wanted to seeing as have really busy day tomorrow and an early class and [inaudible] last night but hopefully will still be fine in getting everything done 'cause have test tomorrow and test the next day that i'm not necessarily prepared for but should have little bit of time throughout the day to study um between class and made sure to order foods that will actually eat and then just be able to go [inaudible] come back to my room to get an work done without worrying that i'm still definitely eating instead of not eating which will be good and i'm grateful for the packed lunch guess [inaudible] my life so today was all right woke up little bit late and was pretty exhausted all day long but still made it to class basically on time realized that this is actually our last week of class which was definitely surprised about because thought that we still had two week um have like [grade that was] not quite as good as was hoping but honestly better than expected it to be had really busy day tomorrow today and have pretty busy day tomorrow too kinda sucked 'cause like didn't really have the motivation to do our reading and know that should've but really have to have it done till thursday which isn't much of an excuse but should be able to do an of it tomorrow so that wednesday have another test tomorrow night um that don't feel prepared for can study for it tomorrow but just feel like i'm not gonna be ready i'd rather write um 'cause haven't really had lot of time to go over the material it still basically new um just go ahead [inaudible] one of our other friends that don't hear from anymore so that was cool [inaudible] really just can't wait to get this over with and go home for break for month off [inaudible] that will just be really nice and really need that time to recover man prepare for another semester which hopefully next semester i'll be doing better so today went really well got to class on time and it was really fun did okay on my test this evening got quite bit of homework done because worked on all the stuff that due tomorrow and some stuff that was due friday so that i'll have less to do on tomorrow and scheduled some appointment with the resident dean to make sure that i'll be able to take my final early um other than that i'm just really glad that this is the last week of class and i'm gonna start making plan on how to study during reading week um to try and make solid day-to-day of what plan on doing to prepare for all of my final and then it won't be too long i'll be back home again so i'm really happy and looking forward to it other than that actually had to go to [inaudible] today and to eat which was really nice because normally don't get to do that but that was little sad because missed the classroom to [inaudible] with my basically my favorite professor but i'm thinking might go to his office hours just to tell him how much enjoy being in his class because it was probably my favorite course this semester i'm also really looking forward to thursday 'cause that'll be my last day with having that specific course and i'm waiting on quite few grades one grades the especially for that class um 'cause it major assignment that we turned in right before thanksgiving break so hopefully it'll be getting back to us pretty soon 'cause other than my final and my mentoring that still great weekend class and then for my with my other class only have one more creative writing assignment to do which should be pretty good and especially because i've got um three out of the five back already and i'm making high in the class so so hopefully i'll get the fourth back this week and then i'll be able to tell with what need to do on the fifth to keep my grades some hopefully um so that was going really well and i'm pretty sure have really good feeling about my other class because could definitely pass everything maybe not with but all this passed which earlier in the semester wasn't so sure about today didn't exactly go well woke up late and missed my first class my second class was still pretty good though do have lot of work that need to get done before reading period starts which will be little bit rough um later in the day [i'm still] [inaudible] class that was also really nice 'cause it the last time had to meet for that class um but then had an important meeting about an financial stuff and an grade stuff that really stressed me out and ended up missing my section 'cause forgot what hour it normally occurs in just guess since was so stressed around about the other stuff that was going on at that time but [i didn't] think about which means i'm really behind in that class which isn't good because my finals are coming up and we're not gonna meet again so i'll have to try make up the work with someone that know um [inaudible] little better 'cause got an good news later in the day um but [inaudible] still in weird mood and had lot of trouble concentrating on homework that need to get done for tomorrow so feel like was super productive yesterday and not pretty productive at all today um especially as just like have not been feeling well so it been hard guess but hopefully will get over that 'cause still have to work shift this week so have quite few more class and doctor appointment before this week are over so hopefully everything will get better and surely i'll be able to wake up on time tomorrow to prepare little bit before class before have to go and prepare little bit for section before have to get to that today was fine woke up later than wanted to but still got to class on time it was my last lecture for my favorite class um and really enjoyed it then went to [section] was little bit disappointed because didn't really talk and wanted to but did talk to one of my classmates after we got out which was pretty nice and got back grade that i'm super proud of and started thinking about how to better prepare for the final um also got quite bit of money and scheduled some time for work um and prepared for my appointment tomorrow so have my last four class three class guess of the semester tomorrow and doctor appointment [inaudible] [relaxing] and even made plans this we for this weekend with friend of mine which should be fun so looking forward to that and hopefully i'll just wake up on time tomorrow [inaudible] to bed little later than wanted since spent some of the day doing some unplanned things like [going to dinner] with friend and going shopping and running to the bank um so taking me little bit longer to finish my homework than thought but but it should still be all right and i'm glad because got done [inaudible] really so that can just turn it in tomorrow and not think about it and just have few more assignments and makeup stuff to do and then can start focusing on finance and hopefully working few extra hours at my job today was the last day of classes so was pretty excited about that and then finished everything it was okay was late to my physical therapy appointment but it still went really well and really need to start doing the exercises but for the rest of the day just kinda felt [really] depressed and pretty much just laid around [inaudible] switch my work shift to tomorrow 'cause didn't have the motivation to get it done and i'm really worried that i'm gonna keep feeling like this 'cause really need to get motivated so that can do my finals and complete the year in positive manner but just don't really see that happening mean have few things set up for next week and i'm meeting with my therapist so hopefully that'll help and don't know how to tell her that think might be depressed and honestly just look at it as an inconvenience because don't have the time to spend on something like this but it is making me lay around and and do my work for hours which really interferes with my life as whole because could have accomplished lot today or even gone out with friends but just didn't do it and made myself feel like more isolated than usually am [inaudible] plans with friends on sunday so hopefully that'll help but i've just been really unsatisfied with everything lately which sucks because was having really good day yesterday and today is definitely low today just basically slept in relaxed for while and went to work did spend little bit of time working on through my pt exercises which was nice and did leave to go get some food so treated myself but think the food turned into not so good idea because ended up pretty sick so don't know if it just because of the fever or just because haven't been feeling well in general lately but that definitely was not fun and was gonna go hang out with friend but he lives pretty far away so decided not to 'cause the [t] wouldn't be running so i'd have to get lift back to campus which is expensive so decided not to do that also found out that might have some homework to do on monday that definitely did not know about um so i'm little bit worried about that but don't think it'll be too difficult to do just have to figure out how it get turned in so we'll see hopefully it won't be too hard other than that might start either one of my review guides or um my final [pre] for some exam tomorrow and hopefully my tf will email me back today slept in but slept little too late 'cause missed meeting with friend uh which was really upset about 'cause haven't seen him in bit and don't know if we're gonna get chance to hang out because we'll both be having fun also leaving for christmas break hopefully i'll get to see him sometime um other than that cleaned up the room bit and stuff but still didn't feel super productive 'cause didn't do any of my homework but don't really have anything to do until tuesday and wednesday so guess it won't be that bad but really need to get out of this little rut i'm in and start getting back to business because need to be prepared for finals um so hopefully i'll get over it sometime soon not really positive though um do have meeting tomorrow so i'll have to be see tomorrow when get up 'cause i've been staying up late and just sleeping in and then have meeting tuesday and wednesday so we'll see how everything goes today went pretty well woke up early and had an appointment [inaudible] and got an other stuff done and went shopping to get an healthy food in in preparation for final exams because there are few things that like to do to study certain way that works for me so bought all the stuff to prepare for that and then came back spent an time relaxing decorated my room little bit cleaned stuff up little bit to help me feel more relaxed and in control was planning on going to bed early but stayed up late because was hanging out with friend it was super nice so i'm still glad that did it and can sleep in little bit tomorrow as long as focus on my works after that because have an event want to go to an assignment due and another appointment and then have an appointment on wednesday that i'll spend tomorrow preparing for and other than that pretty much have an easy week um have to get started on my writing assignment it'll be due later but have plenty of time to works on it and i've already started thinking about it so i'm not super worried today was fine went to bed pretty late but still woke up on basically the time wanted to wake up got some work done and got it turned in and then even went to fair to go get some opportunities for next summer started planning for the future which is really nice 'cause ran into some people that knew um got to see them had appointment with my therapist that was really awesome it actually the last time went to see them before leave um and ran into friend today 'cause went out to dinner but also haven't seen them while so that was super cool and spent the rest of the afternoon getting little bit of work done and chilling um it been pretty relaxing have few things to do tomorrow that forgot about um which should still go okay um and then planned to start on some of my [inaudible] and major project that due monday so hopefully i'll be prepared for the finals 'cause i'm feeling okay about them right now today went by pretty quickly slept in little later than meant to but it was just good to take rest um had actually [inaudible] today so need to get [inaudible] and have to have enough for breakfast and lunch tomorrow saved in the fridge um also had meeting with my tf which was nice to prepare for one of my final exams that are coming up and i've started review sheet for one of my other classes so that should help to feel little bit more prepared i'm going to meet up with professor tomorrow even went to study break tonight with my entryway which don't normally do and it was fewer people than usual but i'm still pretty glad that went 'cause got to see my paf which was nice and got little bit [inaudible] [to apply] for [inaudible] i'll probably [inaudible] in my next semester and think it'll probably [inaudible] apply to few other things as well so i'll definitely [inaudible] so i'm getting out little bit more um tomorrow might also try and go to work um 'cause need to do my hours for this week [inaudible] weekend i'll probably try and go shopping for christmas stuff but have to [inaudible] [for food] today woke up and went to meet with the professor at about noon and we had short discussion which was truly lovely [inaudible] excited [inaudible] talked to him before uh so got back an assignment today that made really good grade on so was really pleased about that and went and did my work um so that been [inaudible] the week so can go do more hours if want but don't have to tomorrow i'll probably wanna try and get an christmas shopping done with my mom hmm and feel like an shopping [inaudible] true to myself and it will be nice 'cause [inaudible] come into little bit of unexpected money and also need to go and return the textbook and saturday will be devoted to starting nicely and maybe even to party with friend um [inaudible] another friend who [inaudible] sort of asking me about it i'm not sure it'll happen i'll be pretty pissed if he do though um [inaudible] i'm gonna try to sleep in little late tomorrow since stayed up late tonight though i'm going to try to set up an alarm so still have time to go shopping do everything wanted to do before it get dark outside and before the stores close so hopefully will wake up with plenty of time today woke up not feeling too well and pretty cold so showered and spent little time to calm down and eat um and spent the majority of the day shopping for christmas which was really helpful because got basically everything needed to get done and there are few things that need to go and do tomorrow um also got to see friend this evening which was nice 'cause we watched one of my well my favorite film and then tomorrow night might be going out with another friend just have to hear back from them and then made plans with friend for tuesday night so think it'll be nice to do some social things however i'm also little bit worried about my finals um definitely need to start some assignment tomorrow and then need to start studying [inaudible] focus next week [inaudible] and make sure that i'm prepared for all of my finals because really wanna do well so i'll just end up seeing how it go guess but [inaudible] think i'll make study guides for every single individual class um probably early next week have few more meetings with teachers as well which will help and then the night before each test can go over the study guides for quick review so hopefully that should help to prepare me well for the exams and i'm pretty confident about two of my courses the third i'm like fairly confident about and it really the fourth one that i'm super worried about but do have all the materials to study for it so it should end up being okay at least mean as long as pass and i've passed all the other exams so i'm not sure if don't pass the finals if i'll still fail the class or not woke up pretty late this morning um it was snowing for the first time which was really exciting so went outside [inaudible] and got to talk to lot of my family members went to see the snow and got lot of pictures for back home [inaudible] know where i'm from um finished up the rest of my christmas shopping um and even got stuff for people that didn't expect to find anything for so it was pretty exciting and had to get back to the [inaudible] so obviously [inaudible] prepared 'cause i'll be leaving guess week from monday i'm really looking forward to it [inaudible] that [inaudible] finals [from] this assignment that have due for class and it [inaudible] about some pretty tough stuff so keep trying to start it but haven't been able to yet 'cause really have to think about what i'm gonna write about 'cause it have lot to do with um death and things um but i'm gonna have to finish it tomorrow 'cause it due monday night and then have finals friday saturday and monday um i'm little bit worried about my friday finals lot worried about my saturday finals and not really stressed about my monday finals um but [inaudible] looking to [inaudible] skills and that should hopefully [inaudible] make me feel better not worse about my finals um and few others [inaudible] this week so uh still have little bit of time to relax and even though as do begin to study and prepare for finals kinda regret not starting earlier but at the same time feel like [inaudible] i've just been too stressed out if started earlier kinda get work better when it get down to crunch time so hopefully everything will be okay i'm not gonna focus on getting some i'm just gonna focus on passing the class so that should relieve some of the stress today woke up pretty late 'cause had pretty rough night sleeping last night um and really don't feel too well so pretty much stayed um in my room all day long and didn't eat food that was super healthy or anything which probably wasn't good but did leave for little bit of time to go to holiday party i'm excited that got to talk to few people that don't normally see and it was pretty nice [inaudible] made some soup really wish [inaudible] started all of my assignments but no motivation to do it um tomorrow think [inaudible] try and get up on time and get few things done so hopefully [inaudible] the assignments is due tomorrow at 900 so mean have fairly good idea what i'm gonna do but it still gonna be little bit difficult and might call my family for some help but i'm not positive yet so [inaudible] because even if don't do quite as well it should be all right since i've done really well on the other assignments for this class this semester and then need to start studying for my other finals that begin on friday today woke up [moments] again later than wanted to that probably 'cause stayed up really late last night which is why i'm going to bed earlier tonight and my roommate and is gonna set plan for tomorrow morning which will be really good um also even though woke up late still got few things done started some studying and finished my assignment that was due tonight little bit early was at meeting to sort of talk about how felt like my classes was going and how feel that things was going which was nice and then went to did some more shopping that didn't think about until the other day so that all set and i'm little bit stressed 'cause ordered package i'm not sure that it'll arrive before have to go home um but if it doesn't it not necessarily the end of the world i'll just be little bit annoyed um but am really looking forward to going home because it just gonna be week now and then i'll have the entire month off to relax and start making summer plan [inaudible] and tomorrow i'm definitely gonna be studying quite bit for my finals that is coming up i'm only really worried about one of them but will start studying for all of them um and also have [inaudible] little [inaudible] [date] tomorrow night so we'll see how that go and still need to make some appointment with this physical therapy and with um my teacher to go over few more things before my finals on friday so hopefully i'll get some stuff planned and everything set up tomorrow and also definitely really need to focus on studying so that can feel confident about [inaudible] exams today was pretty good um woke up pretty late 'cause i've been tired and i'm feeling super well today but still managed to get some studying done probably should have been little more focused than was but do still have tomorrow and thursday and half of friday to prepare for my first exam so it shouldn't be that bad um and then when wasn't studying ended up going out on date and it actually went super well and was really glad to have relaxing evening and probably spent little too much time out seeing as really needed to be studying but feel like it was kind of worth it because had really good time um and came back and kinda need to study but have little bit too much energy so hung out with friends for little bit and now i'm planning on studying and going to bed and hopefully i'll wake up little earlier tomorrow because do have some 900 am exam coming up so need to fix my sleep schedule for that um and also my food schedule need to actually start eating well which did tonight 'cause went out for my date um anyway have been eating lot of fruits and like yogurt and protein for breakfast so feel like that going pretty well um and just need to like keep it up now and probably order lunch from the dining hall tomorrow um which should be nice because their lunch is normally pretty good and can be like pretty healthy for you as well depending on what you get and i've still been eating lot of humus now might go work out tomorrow and also need to try and schedule some appointment with pt because tried to do that today but only got to on hold and it never answered the phone which was definitely little frustrating 'cause need to meet with my uh physical therapist before leave for break so that need to happen sooner rather than later since have all my finals friday saturday and monday and then probably won't have time to see their then um and mean basically now what have planned is studying i'm really glad that got my shopping done earlier so don't have to worry about that and can really just focus on preparing for my finals and getting into the right mindset to do that today slept in way too late and didn't get much work done just really didn't have the motivation and it weird 'cause feel worried about my finals but at the same time don't [inaudible] but that that not really good because know that definitely need to study for them so hopefully get my motivation back tomorrow and my roommate and are gonna actually try and wake up early tomorrow 'cause we've been saying that but we haven't actually done it and did order food so that will make sure to eat healthy food rather than like junk food that i've sort of been eating and just have to work tomorrow so that should help me get some of my motivation back um and then need to make some appointment with pd which are gonna be little bit difficult 'cause forgot to call them today and have barely any time before i'll have to leave on monday um but hopefully all my finals go well and then over break have few things need to get done but i've also already started making plans to hang out with friends and stuff so will spend some time relaxing some time doing schoolwork and then working for my family um i'm [already less] stressed because have started packing so that will be helpful 'cause then once get really busy with finals won't have to worry about it as much and [i was able to do the] shopping need to do hmm really need to work more but can do that next semester probably 'cause plans on being way more on top of things next semester think kinda got into little funk this semester but hopefully i'll get it worked out over break come back more motivated for the [inaudible] today was all right woke up on time and [made little] breakfast which was really nice and got food for my lunch hmm had shift at work which was tiring but wasn't too bad um other than that talked to lot of friends back home which made me little bit more excited about break um and made plans with another friends to go to the movies before leave to go back home which should be really nice um but overall still got very little motivation to prepare for my finals which is really bad because my first one is tomorrow and then have another one on saturday and then on monday um i'm not too worried about my finals tomorrow feel like it'll go okay and that i'll pass the class i'm really worried about my [friday] finals so i'm gonna try and wake up early tomorrow so that have plenty of time to prepare for it and to do little bit preparation for my finals tomorrow evening but um still like i'll be ultimately unprepared just hope still pass the class which the grading scale is different so feel like have pretty fair chance of passing [inaudible] with great grade but feel like that'll be okay because did really well in two of my class not so well in the other two which is definitely new for me but [it was] little more challenging [inaudible] definitely had stressful semester so i'll be happy if just pass also forgot to call pt again today so gotta try and do that tomorrow 'cause don't know if i'll have time to set an appointment before leave to go back home now today didn't go super well woke up on time and spent the morning studying but my roommate came back pretty early and sort of distracted me and interrupted my study other stuff um she doesn't really understand that need to focus which is frustrating and we both had an exam in the evening feel like it went okay and then she kinda did more stuff that was really frustrating while was trying to focus 'cause have an exam tomorrow morning so didn't get nearly as much studying done as wanted to and i'm really not feeling super confident about the exam tomorrow but i'm just gonna have to do my best and hopefully i'll pass i'm gonna go to bed because doesn't wanna get no sleep but i'm gonna try and wake up fairly early to look over stuff before have to go to the exam just 'cause i'm not feeling very confident about it at all it is gonna be long [inaudible] which will hopefully help me make enough points on it to pass which as long as do that should be fine in the class which is little bit reassuring um i'm just ready for it to be over with so i'll take this exam tomorrow and then just have one on monday and then get to go home i'm happy because this weekend i'm hanging out with friend that doesn't normally get to see um so that really nice and might confide in him little bit with the the struggles i've been going through this semester so hopefully that will be okay and hopefully i'll just pass 'cause that all wanna have happen really today woke up really early and had final to take so started little bit before it and then um went and took it and it honestly didn't go super well um don't know feel like was just not feeling too well and didn't do as well as could've but mean it too late to fix it and really just hope that still finished enough stuff to pass which mean don't know surely did so hopefully it'll be okay and other than that um all my friends have left except for one that i'm seeing tomorrow and then i've got one more final before head back home so mostly packed i'm little worried because feel like i'm packing um not enough stuff 'cause all my presents take up lot of room um but should be okay in the end and definitely have time on monday to pack before have to get to the airport so it should all work out today went all right woke up later than wanted to because wasn't feeling super well um but still managed to um get some of my work done did have time [inaudible] to set up meetings and had talked to some people on the phone so didn't get quite as much studying done as want to do then had friend plans with friend for the evening but it was still really nice and i'm little worried about my final tomorrow but also know that i've been working pretty hard in this class all semester so should still do well on the final um as long just look over general information little bit more know the passage identification is gonna be little more difficult than the rest of it overall three canticles but hopefully they'll choose pretty easy passage considering it over the entire work um so feel like some of them will at least be recognizable might not get all the points but still have pretty good feeling probably mean i've 20 to do so should do at least 15 um and my essay writing have always been pretty strong so i'm not fully expecting to get some but definitely feel really confident about passing and i'm ready to go home i'm mostly packed there is few more things that i'm just mainly throwing into my suitcase and i'm thinking about ordering lunch so that can eat before have to leave 'cause can run and get it after my final hopefully but i'm also gonna have to try and get pt tomorrow so have to call them as soon as get out of my final um and see if it have anything which it probably won't so mean maybe won't end up having to do that but kind of really need to go to the chiropractor when get home and need to make sure get everything packed that i'm gonna need 'cause don't wanna forget anything here but should have plenty of time mean hopefully the final won't take th-three hours i'm just glad that the semester is over today went really well woke up on time had my last final which actually did really well on um get grades back in few days so i'm pretty confident about two classes the other two i'm not so much but hopefully still passed um and then uh after finished my final had time to grab lunch which was really good and cleaned up my dorm room before moving to go to the airport to head home for the holidays um it was kind of frustrating 'cause the airport ride took longer than expected cost lot more than wanted it to but managed to my get to my flight on time and then my flight actually turned out to be delayed so spent majority of the days on an airplane and got home super late um lot later than expected but mean i'm just really glad to be here and to have an entire month at home which do need to get an stuff done but also can just spend time relaxing and getting to see family and i'm pretty excited for christmas need to start um wrapping my gifts but i'm pretty pumped about it today got to sleep in really late which was super nice um and spent the day at home with my little sister and spent lot of time cleaning um and worked on some course evals so have one less actual work thing to do over break which is super nice now only have to focus on applying for seminars and um applying for summer programs that might wanna be part of and yeah overall it was just super [pretty] relaxing day um and made plans with friend to hang out which was really cool um because wasn't sure if he would want to over break but he do so hopefully i'll get to do that sometime soon and i'll get to see my extended family and my cousins too and plans to spend whole day with them um and so yeah [honestly] i'm just really glad to be home tomorrow i'm planning on going into work um but it should be really nice and also have few shopping thing that wanna get done and people that want to see so i'm just so glad that it winter break and i'm still little anxious about getting my grades back but honestly i'm just trying to relax today was fine woke up little bit later than wanted to but it was still pretty early considering um then went to work first thing and stayed there for while which was mean nice um so it was just like my old routine getting back into it um then worked out with my brother which was little bit difficult because don't normally work out back at college but wanted to do it so was really glad and he was really helpful um which mean expected him to be so that was super nice and had really good time and i'm planning on making it daily habit so hopefully it'll be something that i'll continue doing once go back to college um i'm not super excited about tomorrow 'cause have to go and see some of my old friends who aren't all the nicest people in the world um so that should be interesting hope it'll be okay don't think anyone gonna do anything in particular it'll probably just be little bit annoying to be around him but shouldn't have to stay too long and there is one friends that am excited to see 'cause we're really close so at least i'll get to spend some time with him and then have plans with that same friends the next day as well um and need to make plans with some other friends and then have plans with my cousins the day before christmas and the day after christmas so i'm getting pretty busy but it really nice i'm little worried because get grades back tomorrow but it'll be nice to get it over with and stop worrying about that during break today went well slept in again later than wanted to but it wasn't too bad still got up and went to work and had good morning shift with some people that haven't seen in while so that was nice and then this evening saw some friends from back home which wasn't mean it was just about what expected it wasn't too horrible it also wasn't great but am just glad to see one of them that i'm actually really good friends with and super happy to see and tomorrow we'll hang out one-on-one which will be really nice and was also really relieved because well didn't get back all of my grades but did get back two grades that was the most worried about today and it looks like i've passed all of my classes i'm super glad about that and tomorrow i'll wake up kind of early have some chores to do and then i'm gonna shower and then i'll go to work again and hang out with some friends and tonight otherwise plan to spend time watching film with some family members which is really nice because it film that i've wanted to watch for really long time so it been nice break so far today was okay went into work again but got to spend some time in the morning relaxing before had to um and then spent the day at the restaurant mainly but it was really nice to be working um got to spend some time with with friend that didn't think i'd get to see today so that was pretty cool and hang out with her way better than expected to which was nice and then spent the evening with another friend and don't think i'll get to see him again before he leaves and we didn't get to spend as much time together as we wanted to but i'm still glad that got to see him overall um and should have plenty of time to see other friend from home and hopefully when my friend [back] from school that [i went to] my hometown as well so made plans with her but these next few day i'll probably just stay with my family um that should be nice 'cause we've got quite bit of stuff to prepare and to get ready for christmas but then after christmas we should have little bit more time to relax and just all be together today has been long day um woke up pretty late this morning and was really not feeling well um and continued to not feel good throughout the whole day basically went to work and [do have] few things that hope to clean up when get home need to clean lot i'm having really bad allergies think from being around all that animal stuff so spend more time dusting and sweeping and spent um my evening with my last my oldest sister who finally got home and it was great to see her and her boyfriend and then um we all ate little bit and has stayed up to wrap presents so that tomorrow evening we're not all as stressed about christmas um so stayed up pretty late doing that and just really started feeling horrible so i'm heading to bed and hopefully that will help so that won't feel as bad tomorrow but it kinda frustrating because my sheets are being washed now so now to put her on my bed before can actually go to bed and then it put all this stuff on the bed i'm supposed to be sleeping in so has to move it all off it little frustrating but it shouldn't take too long to do i'm just really not feeling well and we're supposed to go see lot of people tomorrow so really hope that start to feel better after wake up tomorrow morning i'm not even gonna set an alarm so that can probably sleep in little bit today was okay wasn't feeling super well so slept in quite bit um and then woke up and took shower and brushed my teeth to feel better and then ended up going back to sleep for while then spent the majority of the day relaxing with my family watched some shows played some games with them and also got some email about this [cancer] program applied to be part of next semester which was really happy about because it looks like i'll get to participate in the one that wanted to do um other than that was happy because was talking to friend from school and we're just trying little bit probably gonna make plans to hang out over break and talked to few of my other friend that haven't heard from in while and heard from another friend at school that it got the christmas present from me that it really liked it so was pretty happy about that because was little worried because um don't do christmas present with my friend so i'm super happy that she enjoyed what got them um and i'm on the lookout for package from them not quite sure when i'll get it though but pretty excited for christmas ended up staying up little bit too late just we had lot going on um which will make setting everything up slightly harder but did lot of it last night so that should definitely help out so hopefully won't have to stay up too late tonight because know that my little sisters will wanna get up early in the morning to see if santa come and everything today was fun woke up pretty early um 'cause it was christmas um and spent the holiday with family my parents was happy about the gifts got them which made me happy and my aunt [inaudible] was also happy about the gifts got for them so was really pleased because like getting gifts for people even though it said not to get them gifts figured that the stuff got it wouldn't like [and buy me] so in the end it looks like it did so i've been really happy [even] because got quite de few things asked for as well um especially book that i've been wanting to read um so that super cool because i'm getting to read that and tomorrow have pretty long day planned just waking up early to get home to play game with my cousins and my siblings which should last the majority of the day and then can see if earlier in the week might try to make plans with some friends or [whoever] we've gotten some of the allocations that are gonna be due coming up in january and need something [inaudible] so have few things to work on but also still have plenty of time to relax today was fine um we was supposed to meet woke up late um but we still went and met them anyway it was just later then intended and we spent the entire day playing dungeons and dragons campaign um which it was our first time ever playing except four of our cousins who had played before and it was pretty fun and it took literally the entire day um there was little bit of conflict just because some people didn't get along super well and other people was just causing controversy and not really focusing on the game so it took even longer um i'm sure we would all play again in the future and it will be fine but i'm also not super pumped about it because there too like overall there was too many people and it was too chaotic for me and there this [inaudible] really start feeling left out and when there that many people involved um so kinda had hard time and had [inaudible] but destressed by doing our laundry doing some art and watching our favorite films um and was little pissed off about our laundry because nail polish got on some of our clothes and haven't been able to get it out but can keep on trying so hopefully i'll figure out some solution so that don't have to get rid of that clothes and then tomorrow i'm supposed to get up very early to go to the dentist which i'm not thrilled about but it should be okay today was fine had to go to the dentist which went about just as well as expected it to which was not so great 'cause just have really bad teeth um i'm trying though to take care of them brush [inaudible] lot and [inaudible] flossing though [inaudible] it have to do with having small mouth according to my dentist um so i'm gonna have to go back tomorrow and get some more work done and prescribing me special toothpaste stuff like that which is not gonna be fun 'cause it basically gonna take up my entire day and the parts that i'm not actually at the dentist am gonna feel pretty miserable because it'll be rather sore probably swollen mouth and then i'm gonna have to make plans with friend who actually saw tonight but what them plans for sometime later in the week [inaudible] is one of them on friday but honestly don't wanna hang out with any of them but guess might as well just do it and get it over with and hopefully can find some time to myself [inaudible] because [inaudible] big family so it hard to get any alone time ever especially since my sister birthday coming up and trying to see all my cousins before it leave town again today had to wake up to go to dentist and woke up feeling pretty exhausted um but still needed to go to dentist was little bit late but not anything too bad hmm did some work done but it was actually lot less than it first said um so wasn't there for too long but my mouth did swell up whole bunch 'cause just have really sensitive mouth and it super small um so have to go back tomorrow just to get the last few things done hopefully it won't be too bad because after that have to meet with my friends so i'm [preparing to go] to bed and the dentist [inaudible] want to meet with my friends really trying to just [inaudible] of the way [but it] is little bit annoying because [inaudible] my end-of-term group begins today and there still one class that have not put my grade in yet but it is class am pretty confident about so i'm not too worried about it it just would be nice to know my finalized grade so hopefully that will get posted sometime soon today was okay had to go to the dentist and was there for the majority of my day and my mouth really hurt afterwards um 'cause they did some work but then they messed up so they had to redo some of they so was there for longer than expected basically they was just mess and had took lot of medicine to try and make my mouth feel better but basically didn't feel good for the rest of the day and still don't feel well so i'm trying to go to bed little bit earlier um did also meet up with my friends which went just about as expected to which wasn't great because generally they just try and talk [in one of each other] and pretty much sat there in silence um so hopefully won't have to see them again before go back i'll just hang out with some of my other friends like my friends from school who actually like and hopefully that will go better and then went back to work and hoped to close down um um still really didn't feel well and got home pretty late had dinner pretty late and tomorrow is my little sister birthday so i'm having to prepare for that which is generally just lot of stress um 'cause they was not going to [redacted] we have to drop all them presents and do all that and also have to be ready to go to work in the morning again so i'm hoping that i'll wake up and my mouth won't hurt as much anymore today did not go super well the morning started off fine and i've [inaudible] and was happy to be at work doing something that i'm used to and something that is fun um so it it started out just perfectly fine and was pretty happy and was on top of it didn't really eat much though which was probably part of the reason wasn't started not feeling well later in the day and on top of that my mouth was still sore it didn't feel any better since yesterday and that [inaudible] worse so felt really disconnected from all of my family members [inaudible] that so it was nice to [inaudible] with people but was really interested in getting some sleep which is really difficult for me and really makes me feel bad um so ended my day pretty upset which is why [inaudible] just got home planning to go straight to bed instead of staying up um and maybe just taking some time with myself tomorrow because am still pretty upset about it but also don't really feel like discussing it but just whenever try to it don't understand so it not really worth it to keep bringing it up just to be misunderstood and feel like no one cares even don't know more so i'll just try to [inaudible] myself do art or some writing to relax today was fine slept in pretty late woke up not feeling super well because had migraine but also not too bad hmm just took some medicine and it went away and then spent the rest of the day with family which was okay um it turned out better than expected it would be after uh yesterday and the day before um other than that had pretty nice [new year's] party um did talk to quite few of my friends um which was fun and i'm gonna make plans to hang out with some of them pretty soon which should be nice and i'm happy 'cause still have basically month till go back to school um so should have plenty of time to relax and fill out of some of my um study abroad applications and things like that to prepare for next semester um somewhere around spring break so everything going pretty well today slept in really late and then spent part of the day going into town with my sisters and getting some shopping done um which was fun because didn't spend too much and even got some cute stuff and also got to treat my sisters to little snack on the way back home and then and spent the rest of the evening pretty much relaxing [inaudible] my sis my sisters and her boyfriend are heading back home tomorrow um it was really nice for me to get my mood back and [my sleep] which i've been trying to work on [inaudible] vacation and my art that wanted to do um so it was all pretty nice on the downside there lot of tension between my mom and dad right now which makes everything really rough uh tomorrow have to get up very early to [do my studying] and [inaudible] but i'm trying to [inaudible] super great [inaudible] makes me [inaudible] and gives me headache so that not gonna be very much fun and hopefully i'll be able to get up on time since didn't really go to bed as early as should have today was fine and did begin pretty early um but today it was because had to go to the dentist again it did lot of work and [inaudible] mouth it even scratched my face at one point but um in the end it wasn't too too bad it was okay and on the plus side hopefully won't have to go back for bit although it did tell me that have to get my wisdom teeth out which is also not gonna be very much fun and also have to make doctor appointment because have to do everything that can um while i'm home since don't have dental and stuff back at campus although do have medical but still i'm gonna try and get as much done as possible um it gonna be fun um kind of on the plus side my sister and her boyfriend left today so get my room back i'm also sad that my sister leaving but also the combination of her and her boyfriend is pretty obnoxious and have been wishing that next christmas she would just come back by herself but really doubt that it gonna happen uh because it looks like they're gonna give me read and all so we'll just have to see um but mean can put up with him because he make her happy other than that i'm little getting slightly worried just because it so close to school starting back up and hadn't realized um that have so few days left here at home um and still have quite few things to do but it shouldn't be too bad mean have time to get her done really just have to finish my study abroad applications my freshman summer applications need to respond to few other things and um then the rest of it is really just self improvement that want to [inaudible] going to the gym more which my brother is helping me with and eating healthier which i'm trying to do on my own and practicing violin working on my art things like that um so will have plenty of time in this last few days at home to work on some of that stuff today was fine woke up little bit too late but um so was supposed to go to work this morning but it still wasn't bad um but did get to work and stayed there for basically the whole day spent some of the evening hanging out with friend that haven't seen since got home and spent the rest of the evening at home with my family um watching film which is why probably stayed up later than should have 'cause have to get up and go back to work tomorrow morning um but mean i'm sure that i'll get up [inaudible] and it will be fine my other thing is um my tooth have been hurting so had to go to the dentist the other day and also have to [go to] chiropractor 'cause i'm very sore but [hopefully] get to do that as well tomorrow um my sister is leaving on saturday so i'm probably pretty busy until then but do have sundays and mondays off so that'll help little bit today was fine basically once again all did was wake up and go to work um which however i'm pleased [inaudible] which is little bit stressful but could [inaudible] and everything okay but wasn't feeling super well 'cause still have to go to the chiropractor and it been like months now um so hopefully might go tomorrow mean hopefully at least if not tomorrow it will be sometime this week because desperately need to go i'm starting to get headaches and double vision since haven't been so long um so know that once am able to go and do that i'll start feeling lot better and um other than that have few errands need to run that haven't been able to do since i've been at work every day basically um and don't know when i'll get that done if wake up on time tomorrow can go in even earlier for work and maybe get some shopping done so i'm gonna try and do that but i've been really tired i'm staying up too late um my my [little] sister wanted to spend time um but hopefully i'll be able to take it up in the morning on time and go in today it was all right spent the day at work um and woke up this morning really not feeling well so drank lot of tea and took some medicine to try and make myself feel better um but one of our workers um ended up not being able to come in so we had to call on her [inaudible] and the [police] isn't exactly hopeful so that was pretty stressful because we had to do more work to make up for it and the other people that was on the shift weren't exactly weren't oriented either and so [redacted] he really [toughed] the shift because we did get quite busy um but we was able to handle it was little bit annoyed then went to the chiropractor today so i'll probably be sore um tomorrow but after that should feel lot better 'cause i'm always bit sore right after some adjustment before the soreness goes away um and hopefully drinking this herbal tea stuff that our cousin recommended will stop our sore throat um 'cause really don't want to have to goes to the doctor while i'm here and tomorrow our older our other older sister is going back to school um so will be the only one left now since get to stay so late which is nice but also means i'll have more stuff to do on top of the schoolwork that already need to be doing and haven't really started but now [inaudible] sundays and mondays should be freed up little bit more so that can hopefully get stuff done then today was fine it was basically the same as every other day um got up and went to work which did wake up little bit earlier today um again work was super duper busy so that was what spent my whole day doing um but it was good mean we handled it was also excited because we got to make some really good cheese um that love and that also super fun to make and got to do it so was excited about that um had quite few customers and after work got to um see my grandmother which was also really nice since haven't seen her in while um only the only real downside of the day was that my other older sister left um because she had to go back to school already and i'm kinda sad 'cause we didn't get to spend too much time with her um since her break was lot shorter than mine but um i'm so glad that did get to see her and hopefully i'll get to see her again in april if not in april then most likely at least get to see her for little bit over the summertime so we'll just see what happens today had lazy day at home um so got to sleep in really late and spent most of the day just relaxing with my family which is really lovely we're doing harry potter marathon um so we can [inaudible] that that was fun and um should've worked on some things but didn't really get anything done and was planning on working on stuff tomorrow but it turns out i'll actually have to be in town all day with my mom might try and take my laptop though so can still do few things in the car 'cause we'll be going out of town to do some shopping for the restaurant um but hopefully that should be fun mean i'm not really sure but should be okay i'm just kind of upset 'cause that mean have to get up pretty early and hadn't planned on it especially since i'm going to bed so late since didn't find find out until just minute ago but it should still be fine so we'll just see how it goes today woke up early which was on time because had plans with my mom this morning um but we didn't end up getting to them until way later than expected so spent the majority of the day with my grandmother and one of my cousins um but it turned out to be lot better than expected um really 'cause don't get to talk to my cousins recently she much younger than am and whenever we get together she don't talk to me 'cause i'm bit older and she hangs out with the kids um so it was really interesting today 'cause went to speak to them lot and my uncle stopped by them dad so went to see them as well and he my godfather so it was really nice and he wanted to make plans to meet up before go back to school um 'cause he has some stuff he wants to discuss with me and book that he got me for christmas was waiting uh for it to come into the bookstore so i'm gonna make plans with them soon hopefully um other than that spent the rest of the day with my mom we had to go to town to get some shopping done um which turned out fine we was kind of quite while but it wasn't too bad traffic was just little bit heavy um but was pretty happy because made plans with well somewhat planned with someone for when get back to school and made plans with friend for tomorrow morning to get breakfast um who also from out of state um so it would be nice to hangs out with them again 'cause haven't seen them in like few weeks um and then after that i'll just spend the day at work and i'm planning on taking my sketchbook and some other stuff and book to read um so that hopefully the time will speed up when don't has any customers can keep busy and actually feel productive instead of just sitting down like has been doing for the last few day today was okay um woke up later than wanted to and was pretty exhausted had plans with friend to go to breakfast so definitely had to get up um but they ended up canceling the last minute but they was already too late 'cause had already gone into town um so in struggling to get with them just went into work to try and come home early um and then got lot of stuff done there still felt like wasn't really getting enough stuff uh prepared to go back to school feel like i'm not ready to start again large part of they is going back and seeing some of my friend 'cause they're not exactly the best um but there is few people i'm excited to see and i'm trying to give myself more scet set plans and schedule next semester so that make sure to do things like work out and um work for my job little bit more than had last semester um and go to the dining hall more and things like that and stay on top of my homework um so hopefully it'll be okay i'm glad that still have uh quite bit of break left because definitely need the time off um to try and get my head on straight and i'm planning on talking to my counselor again once start going back to school today was all right um woke up too late to go in early with my mom because wasn't feeling well and then there was lot to be done [inaudible] um so did all of that worked all day and got into fight with my with my sister um over financial stuff and other things and almost ended up changing my ticket back to early but knew my mom and my other little sister would be really upset if did that so didn't um [inaudible] just stayed at the restaurant all day long and worked and didn't even have time to work on stuff for school but um should be able to stay home at least friday or saturday mainly and then also have sunday and monday to work on it um because tomorrow i'm gonna get up in time to go into town with my mom and then have plans with friend later on that haven't seen since got home so hopefully that will be fun today woke up on time um it took me longer than wanted it to to get ready um but was still on time so that was good went to town early so got to get some shopping done that really wanted to do which was really nice um and then at work the morning shift turned out pretty busy but it was okay 'cause we basically had enough help and then got to leave work early to go hang out with um some high school friends one of them hadn't seen and was leaving [redacted] tomorrow um and had some okay time with them it wasn't quite everything wanted it to be but it was still pretty good was glad got to see them before it left before left and i'm really considering um making plans with one of my other friends that had seen once since got back home um to try and see them again before have to go back to school but i'm trying to decide because sometimes hanging out with them can be more frustrating than it is fun um but i'm also don't have too much time left so have to make plans with people pretty soon before head back to school today woke up little bit later but still got to work as usual um and work was super busy um it got busier than expected so had to get some extra help um and that was basically had been there all day and the rush we got was at the nighttime so was basically on my feet for good three hours without being able to take break so i'm definitely sore i'm having some back issues but not anything too super bad so hopefully by tomorrow i'll feel little bit better because we have catering job that have to prepare for um also [inaudible] just one of the other employees [inaudible] early now [inaudible] calling to [let me know] am such hard worker um which made me feel good and [so] definitely talk to them more [inaudible] usual and it kind of nice to talk to some regular customers um my uncle stopped by [just tried] to see them for bit um so overall it was productive day even got some of the schoolwork done had been meaning to work on should book another [inaudible] tomorrow and have i'm staying home for the [friday] and sunday so it should be nice work was super busy again today um so ended up being super tired 'cause we stayed later than we had been um and we just had more customers and more rushes than normal um which wouldn't have been bad except for the fact that really needed to get some of my writing done for some applications so i'll have to try and work on that tomorrow and the next day [inaudible] since didn't have time to do it at work um and didn't really get to take break so i'm currently sore and not feeling well and was super sleepy basically day long um and when got home should've just gone to bed but my little sister wanted to stay up so ended up staying up way too late watching show um which really just made me feel worse so i'm gonna sleep in tomorrow and hopefully that will make me feel better today was having lazy day at home intended to get some of my stuff done but didn't the only thing did accomplish was laundry um which did still make me feel pretty good other than that didn't do anything all day long really um [inaudible] 'cause tomorrow i'm gonna have to go to dallas i'm just gonna [inaudible] i'll try and to write my um some more applications 'cause the-they're due in just about two day believe um so really really have to get them done really just have not been in the right mindset to do any work was supposed to go [inaudible] today which hoped woulda helped but they cancelled on me last minute um which kinda just made me feel worse um hopefully tomorrow will be better and guess even if do end up going to dallas on the way can still work on my some of my applications um and hopefully get some [inaudible] um there are lot want to apply to but definitely need to cut they down anyway and only apply to couple and then have few other school thing need to do 'cause go back in week which i'm excited about and stressed about today was basically just another lazy day at home um slept in 'cause didn't feel too great so took some medicine for migraine and [inaudible] rest of my day is just [inaudible] relaxing um accepted my place in the kangaroo dance thing um which should be lot of fun for when go back to school but it'll also be really big time commitment and also looked into doing sorority type thing as well and some of the classes i'm gonna be taking but couldn't really find the motivation to write my freshman summer applications which is due tomorrow by noon um have worked on few though so should just submit those which won't be as many as wanted to submit but even if don't get into one can just take another classes shouldn't be some issue um and tomorrow we will probably have work unless the weather is too bad so guess we'll see 'cause if we don't have work then will definitely have more time to do some of my seminars in the morning as long as actually wake up which is debatable as to whether or not will just stayed at home all day today um instead of going into work because slept in late because my [inaudible] kept me up for good portion of the evening um and then kept waking up in the middle of the night because i'm not feeling too well so did just end up staying home and it was pretty nice to have day off but my [sooners] was due at 1200 and woke up because didn't do them because forgot that the time zone over there is an hour ahead of here um so should've turned them in an hour before had planned to um which was completely my fault so had an of them written and ready but it should be fine can just take normal class or if there is spots left for an [sooners] you can email professors sometimes to get in so might be able to try that as well and my [inaudible] advisor emailed me today so i'll have to try and get back to them tomorrow and also need to start um financial aid stuff and um summer and spring break programs [start] tomorrow um which hopefully i'll be able to do even though i'll be going into work in the morning and also hope that can get little bit of shopping done but don't know that my mom necessarily wants me to so i'll just have to see because i'll ha am going back to school in just few day feel like am ready for it but not really ready for it today slept in little bit later than intended so went in-into town later as well which was due to me just not feeling super well um and then spent the day at work which weren't super busy so when weren't working did few things for school and also played some games um and then after work had to go to the dentist which was fine um it was actually quick this time and this is the last time i'll have to go before i'm back campus in just few day um my roommate was [inaudible] along today which is cool because it kind of made me more excited to go back um and was super happy because got some email from the departments about how well did in class um basically asking if was further interested in studying that subject so i'm super pumped about that because it is something i'm interested in so i'll probably meet with them when get back to campus as well today woke up on time which was pretty early this morning went and got to do some shopping um got to choose my own [inaudible] which was really cool because got to get lot of stuff that wanted and needed um to go back um to school this semester i'm also pretty excited 'cause think finally decided um which study abroad programs i'm going to apply to and know there so much stuff need to get done and have some solid plans for going back um just can't believe that only have few days left in my hometown [inaudible] sort of [inaudible] wanna come back here for spring break but also worry that if come back here too much that i'm just gonna wanna stay so think i'm gonna try and [inaudible] spring break [inaudible] somewhere else and then kinda just come back here for summer and i'll have whole another month or so off depending on whether or not can [inaudible] study abroad programs i'm definitely gonna miss my family lot and i'm hoping that the stress of this semester doesn't get as bad as it did the last semester because should be little bit more prepared and [inaudible] this whole idea of how to handle it but things [inaudible] frustrating like it did the last semester um so hopefully [they] will get better today was another normal day um went to work but before that went to um to have facial done as birthday present um which was really nice it was super relaxing um and was glad that started monday out on positive note like that um after that did come in to work and we was fairly busy but the employees mostly handled it so was able to get some schoolwork done which was awesome because have quite few things that have due dates that are coming up um and tomorrow i'm hoping to get more time to finish them because know that when get back to campus it'll be really busy but i'm not sure if it'll happen because have to do lot of shopping tomorrow um also in preparation of going back to school so i'm going to have to see mean we do have quite few employees coming in so might be able to do that other than that um my family all came by to see me before um [heading] out of state and [inaudible] me like happy birthday wishes so got some gifts and got to see everyone which was pretty nice little bit stressful 'cause it came at time when we was busy at work um but it turned out all right and some of the books got was really awesome and i'm super excited about being able to read them and i'm pretty ready for school to start again now 'cause feel like i've mostly got my classes and my schedule figured out for when get back to campus so it should be okay today was my last day at home um tomorrow i'm heading back to school it was definitely pretty stressful day lot of stuff happened um that wasn't exactly great and [inaudible] to be back at school i'm definitely stressed because didn't really get the chance to prepare and to do everything wanted to do um before heading back so i'm gonna have lot more work tomorrow and definitely lot more luggage than expected which is little bit frustrating um but i'm probably just gonna have to get some friends to help get it back to the dorm which hopefully it will be available and it gonna definitely take while to unpack stayed up later than intended to packing in the first place um but don't know as far as classes and everything feel like it should be all right didn't really get the summer wanted but that okay today got back to school spent basically the entire day traveling which was not fun was really stressed almost missed my flight um luckily they still let me on which was super nice um and other than that had to say goodbye to my family which was really difficult um i'm definitely going to miss them all uh i'm not going to get to see them for while hopefully i'll get to see them in march for spring break and my sister in april if we're [ever at] them school we'll just have to see um quite few things are starting this week have my first class tomorrow at 830 in the morning which are definitely gonna be little difficult 'cause really stayed up too late tonight packing and getting getting some other stuff done um and there are stuff programs that need to apply to so i'm [definitely] gonna have to work on that tomorrow 'cause the deadline coming up since should've finished that at home didn't have time to was gonna work on some stuff on the plane but then some thoughts have happened wasn't able to um basically they was really stressful day and just really hope that my class go well i'm meeting my academic adviser later in the week so hopefully they can help me out um with everything and hope that can also get [inaudible] into more set routine going to bed on time getting up on time doing my homework quickly starting yoga and seeing some friends and joining [clubs] that i'm interested in because feel like doing that things and being more social will make me have much better semester overall today had my first real day of classes so had to get up little bit early but that really wasn't too bad um managed to do it and made it to classes on time and that classes should go about how expected it to um which is not gonna be super well unless put in quite bit of work which i'm definitely gonna try to do i'm gonna try and time-manage my semester found really great spot to study um that think i'm gonna start taking advantage of because think it will definitely help me focus and will help me to get out of the room more um also signed up for sorority-type event um that had to pretty much force myself to do 'cause it will make me socialize lot more but i'm really looking forward to it and i'm still debating doing the other sororities as well um because do wanna get lot more involved um i'm pretty excited because i'm shopping two classes although think i'm pretty set on which one i'm planning on taking although will figure it out with my academic advisor on wednesday um and also on wednesday have pta meeting which will be nice although i'm probably not prepared but am planning on starting to work it out and get set schedule down which should help with that and also have my first um dance practice which is super exciting 'cause believe that will give me nice community of people to work with um since we'll all be dancing together and being in show together so hopefully everything gonna look up today got to couple of other classes went shopping and it looks like it'll be um fun but also lot of hard work and had to get quite few textbooks for it uh so had to enter lottery for it so hopefully will in fact get in um because i've already gotten the books and i'm really looking forward to taking it so if don't i'm gonna have to try and find different classes to be in um and am going to meet with an academic advisor tomorrow so that should help little bit um basically my schedule is super busy because have an applications due in two days tomorrow i've got four different appointments and an event to go to all evening so i'll definitely have to try and finish my homework for thursday sooner um and then need to do my homework for friday because on thursday will be super busy once again and thursday is when my applications am due um so i'm gonna have to get all of that done [over] short time period um where don't have lot of time to myself so may have to try and find an alternative study space to work on essays and things but i'm looking forward to doing these event because feel like it'll make me more social and i'll just have to plan my time accordingly so it'll be okay today was really fun got to um not have any classes so instead just had bunch of meetings with um professors um to talk about my future in both classics in neuroscience which was interesting um because i'm still not really sure what wanna do but think that it at least helped little bit um and then also [inaudible] and we discussed um plans for the summer which didn't really have um the applications done for and they're due tomorrow so that not exactly great but i'm planning on getting up early tomorrow morning and just focusing and really working on them because have events um tomorrow evening and then i'll be fairly busy on friday as well um have homework that need to get completed for friday so i'm gonna have to try and do all of that thursday morning um but hopefully it won't be too bad and then [inaudible] going into this weekend it looks like i'll be pretty busy with um some extracurricular activities tonight had my first dance group appointment um and it was lot of fun but also still [inaudible] is pretty big time commitment which is gonna make my classes little bit more difficult but think if just focus on finding good support systems both with friends and with professors then the next semester will turn out okay um was disappointed because didn't get into my classes really wanted to get into but you know it might be okay because i'm taking another really fun classes with good friends um so hopefully that will be awesome today was pretty busy um had friend in class and it was fun um especially 'cause have the class with my friend so we all got to be there together um ran into someone haven't seen in while that i've [inaudible] but didn't actually talk to him so maybe i'll try and get that next time because didn't get my confidence up little bit today um because managed to make myself go to an event um and plan on continuing to do that have another event tomorrow night and feel like it definitely helping me become little bit more social and outgoing it'll help me make an new friend and it just helping my overall happiness overall to be doing things instead of staying in the room the whole time especially 'cause i'm still able to stay on top of my schoolwork while doing it finished an applications tonight and i've got two more that will get start go through other opportunities that i'm looking forward to so it should be really good i'm gonna meet with my counselor next week and think that she will definitely be proud of me for the work that i've been doing um so hopefully this semester is already going better than last semester would just have to take that class [inaudible] 'cause am gonna struggle in two of him today was fine only had one class and met someone really nice in it so was pretty happy about that because used to work with him which was fine um other than that had to go to work today but it was okay plus got to talk to my sister on the phone for like two hours and hadn't talked to her for like weeks um so that was really nice as well and then [inaudible] spent some time [relaxing] in my room i'm super happy 'cause got um new computer in the mail that had been looking forward to and i'm still trying to set it up so hopefully i'll have little more luck tomorrow or something but it seems super nice so it should be fine i'm probably gonna call him and see how to set up [inaudible] with some actual professionals um and then this evening we had some friends over for little pizza party which was lot of fun 'cause they're both super nice and had another sorority event to go to but that was also all right because had really good time um at it and ran into someone that knew um which was super cool because didn't realize that she was also doing the sorority stuff um so hopefully that will help have another big sorority event tomorrow that will basically last the majority of my morning so i'm gonna take some homework to work on so hopefully can still get stuff done while also figuring out if want to join that sorority and the weekend think it'll be super busy and have quite bit of work to do as well so yeah i'm just trying to balance everything out today was fun um recently had social event on morning [inaudible] so got up pretty early to get ready for that um and still had time to breakfast and everything get prepared and went met lot of really cool people that was really glad got the chance to talk to and got to so see some other people that um know from other event which was awesome 'cause didn't know that they was also involved um so that took the majority of my morning um also got very last-minute email for one of my classes about some of my work requirements for monday which was definitely stressful 'cause already have busy weekend and have to add some extra work on top of that um so had to go running around looking for book at the very last minute um and luckily they had one left in stock so managed to get that for my classes hmm and then other than that um spent the day trying to set up my new computer and get they fully working which am super pumped about so hopefully it'll be more operational tomorrow and i'm gonna get up bit early again because have gotta get bunch of homework done and then have my social event in the evening to go to um that will take uh quite bit of time but should still have time to do little bit more homework after this so gotta get ready for the week today was not exactly great um had fun going to the event that had today but i'm already struggling with my schoolwork and it barely the first week of classes um so went ahead and signed up for tutor and have meeting with my therapist on tuesday so think i'm just gonna have to be really straightforward don't know if i'm depressed or just have really bad anxiety about my work but it not going well and feel like i'm falling behind in my last semester my grades weren't great and mean to me i'm just at the point of considering taking year off which definitely don't want to do but feel like might have to do because don't really know what other options have um and even thinking about it just is upsetting me 'cause feel like i'm behind everyone else here um [inaudible] lot of people feel like that but i'm feeling for me it true in the stem department know in humanities i'm generally okay but think my prior stem education was lacking um but think talking to my therapist will help and she'll probably provide me with other resources so it hard for me to really talk to people because i'm embarrassed about what don't know but feel like just have to bite the bullet if want the semester to go any better than last semester and do 'cause wanna be less stressed yeah and on top of everything so need to get to point where can do that and function today was okay um woke up on time and managed to get little bit of my homework done that didn't [done] last night then had all my classes um but had to go to one for the first time that was actually super interesting and i'm really glad i'm taking it i'm little frustrated 'cause think it will change for another one of my classes that make my schedule little bit more messed up than it was previously um we should be [inaudible] to get worked out and then had pretty busy evening as well um and finished my essay that was due by midnight and did um go to two different meetings and had to miss rehearsal to go to the second meetings um it wasn't the best but [inaudible] anything that can't make up uh so it should be okay and i'm really excited because have my [inaudible] sorority stuff and now just have to wait for bit which will be wednesday morning really hope we can get one 'cause i'm super pumped about it and i've met so many nice people um but i'm just really looking forward to doing it uh tomorrow is gonna be definitely busy should have done little bit more reading but [inaudible] already few time so hopefully [inaudible] enough um and on top of that i'm meetings with my counselor tomorrow and already have quite few things that wanna talk to her about uh so hopefully that meetings will be productive today was pretty good um had uh quite few classes but they was pretty interesting was little sleepy 'cause ended up not being able to fall asleep for while last night even after tried to go to bed um they okay 'cause still managed to stay awake during my classes and then after classes was over went to have [inaudible] with my counselor um which was really nice um because haven't seen her since i've been back so talking to her was great and then um really was able to focus and got my homework done and felt okay about they not great but have applied for tutor and plan to go to office hours once they start up um so that should definitely help and um since finished my homework pretty early also got to finish an application that wanted to do and still had time to watch show um so they was nice way to end the evening do have to get up super early tomorrow but they for an exciting reason 'cause they bid day um they the reason go to bed so i'll [inaudible] go join one which am super pumped about can't wait to see lot of people know so they exciting today was exciting because i've had to get up early um to go out and find out which sorority was gonna be part of um so joined and got the [approved] list with um all the other girls that joined in the [inaudible] which is super cool especially because already knew few of the other members and [inaudible] some of the other girls who got into to the same sorority um so that was exciting because i'll have friend in that and i'm really looking forward to doing all the events that is fun and hopefully really good way for me to get more involved um [totally fun way] to have some other friend um going down [inaudible] with one of my other extra good friend from [inaudible] but i'm gonna try and get it worked out so hopefully it will be okay um only had one class today which was nice because had to get up super early um so was really tired so had originally planned [to work] but being extremely tired paired with not feeling well resulted in me taking nap instead so i'll just go and do the work on saturday which won't be nearly as fun but i've got to do it because i'm trying to be captain um and i'm little bit stressed because have test keep forgetting about tomorrow night that i'm not prepared for and stayed up way too late just had um something extracurricular tonight that took up all the time and i'm [inaudible] homework and had stress with my blocking group stuff that resulted in me also being distracted from my homework to try and deal with that for while so hopefully tomorrow will be better even though it pretty busy day today went really well um had my one of my classes for the second time today um think it was nice because we had we have group assignment for the weekend and um i'm fairly excited about [inaudible] [about] to work with so also sort of made another friend in the classes um this other guy that was in one of my classes last semester um it just really cool to have have person know um other than that only had one other classes it was super fun and had to meet professor which was little late too um because [messed up] my [inaudible] [falling out] um so ended up meeting with her pretty late but it was okay 'cause ran into another girl that knew um and then when was done still had time to study for my exam tonight which went ok probably could have studied for little bit more but don't think did too badly um and then even got to get dinner with friend um before the exam someone i'm blocking with so it was really good to hang out with him other than that tomorrow shouldn't be too busy but do have lab which is quite long and i'm debating whether or not to try and um take some time to go to work tomorrow because do have little gap of time in the middle of the day but could also use it to do some homework um because might be going out tomorrow night i'm not really sure yet um and on saturday have plans with another guy but also have to do my group project saturday and go to work on saturday so we'll see how it all work out today was pretty good only had two classes but one of them was lab so it took quite bit of time um and made plans to hang out with someone tomorrow which was nice but at the same time also have to do group project which i'm not as excited about um but i'll get it all done also have to go to work tomorrow but it should be ok because have it all planned out so that can do everything wanna do so guess i'll get up on time in the morning probably gonna have to get coffee or something 'cause i'm going to bed so late but it was worth it 'cause tonight went out to party and had really good time with the the girls from [redacted] think made really good friend or two um and i'm really looking forward to future events with all of them hanging out partying doing stuff so i'm just really grateful that get to be part of such wonderful community and mean wasn't sure that i'd get in and did so i'm really excited about it today was pretty good had to wake up pretty early to group project and that was just on time for that um which was nice and i'm glad about the group that i'm working with because everyone sweet and everyone on top of it so we can get work done um it also more than expected so was gonna have [inaudible] and then went to my job for few hours which was nice 'cause [inaudible] extra so [inaudible] extra next week um and then other than that had date this evening which was all right [inaudible] think have feelings for him like that and he obviously have feelings for me um so i'm not exactly sure how i'm gonna handle it but as for the evening hanging out with few more of my friends [inaudible] which made me feel lot better about it um [inaudible] if [inaudible] getting home [inaudible] you know um and join my friends but should be able to get some time tomorrow and try and get up um fairly early um 'cause [inaudible] five and like three assignments to monday and two assignments to tuesday or three assignments to tuesday so have quite bit to do uh but it shouldn't be too bad as long as get up and actually focus and get it done um so hopefully will stick to that today was all right um was little bit um frustrated about this guy i've been talking to but hopefully i'll be able to handle it 'cause um over the next few days 'cause don't really wanna spend too much time worrying about it um i've got lot of homework to do today and got [errands] to be done and still need to catch up on some readings um may have some time today or tomorrow but also have to be home to do group project tomorrow because my group couldn't meet up today um but was also glad because got to spend some time with friends we actually went out to dinner which was nice um it really was kind of worth it and this week is looking like it'll be pretty busy i've got quiz tomorrow not tomorrow tuesday and class i'm gonna have to get ready for so hopefully i'll get everything done in timely fashion so have time to study and go to bed at reasonable hour instead of super late like have been doing i'm going to dance practice tomorrow night which i'm not necessarily looking forward to maybe because i'm pretty tired and sore and haven't had time to practice i'm pretty sure it'll still be okay [inaudible] because we only have four more practice until my show but i'll just have to try and find some free time to work on the dance on my own today was all right i'm not feeling too well and i'm full of worry and getting sick so i'm getting sore throat which isn't gonna be good because have my dance performance coming up and quite few events um to my other extracurriculars and i'm also super busy with schoolwork have possibly two courses tomorrow and lot of reading that i'm behind on um but we-wednesday at least is my slow day so hopefully can just go to class and work and take some time to relax since i'm not feeling super well but will also have to go to work um i'm really hoping that don't have strep or the flu 'cause that what it feeling like but hopefully um will just take some emergency and start feeling better and trying to sleep lot we'll see today went pretty well um was pretty prepared for class in section which had been worried about but it turned out all right it was really nice to see my crew members in class and just [inaudible] having [inaudible] always makes it easier um [inaudible] do an assignment that i'm super excited about that i'm gonna have to finish tomorrow 'cause was planning on starting today but never did which is definitely not gonna be fun 'cause it an assignment that [inaudible] come easily to me hopefully it won't take too long 'cause only have one class tomorrow but really need to go to work and need to practice for dance and go to actual dance practice um and then on tuesday have few things to do on friday have an things to do have quite few things leading into this weekend i'm prepared for having uh stress because [inaudible] dance performance it also coming up and definitely haven't practiced enough so really need to be on [inaudible] and have three practice left um and [inaudible] all right had to [clear] the [inaudible] super prepared for but think [this] will turn out okayish um and [inaudible] my section today actually am waiting for [inaudible] so [inaudible] my therapist is going to be pleased and [inaudible] generally don't speak um and got lot of time to talk to my mom and it felt like [inaudible] things sometimes which was really nice and relaxing and also managed to do my laundry and clean up little bit which always makes me feel better today was all right woke up earlier than needed to and was exhausted since went to bed so late so got to go back to sleep which was really nice and class went fairly well did get grade back that wasn't too great but should be able to make it up no problem which will be really nice um other than that was really busy went to work um which was good [so that's] out of the way so don't have to worry about it on saturday and have dance practice tonight which took up quite bit of time which was difficult 'cause had an assignment up that i'd been working on that i'm [inaudible] due tomorrow morning so i'm having to stay up late again to work on that but hopefully all my assignment i'll be doing friday won't be too difficult so can actually get them done and go to bed early 'cause am exhausted and might be going out with friends uh friday night and saturday which will be really nice but i'm still debating whether or not should stay and do an homework rather than that um but could [inaudible] trying to do homework saturday morning and then have [inaudible] sunday so might stay [inaudible] but will see do have shopping to get few things so we'll see today went fairly well and was exhausted 'cause stayed up way too late last night um 'cause was busy and on top of that just wasn't feeling well in general which sucks um but class was really nice at least and got lunch and dinner with the same friend and made some plans for this weekend and for next week so i'll be pretty busy but am also looking forward to it i'm debating going out with friend tomorrow night might just stay in since haven't been feeling well and need to do quite bit of homework so guess we'll just have to see whatever happens um and other than that um everything been going okay i'm just considering going to the doctor and i'm little stressed because of some stuff going on with my family back home but there not too much can do about it other than offer support and talk to them um so hopefully they'll all work it out um so today was okay had sort of rough night last night um so today wasn't feeling super great and sort of spent the day not doing anything um which really wasn't good because i've i'm planning on going out with friend tomorrow to get some errands done and also have quite bit of homework um and just have one class that watching lot of films and really reading heavy um but if really focused more should be able to get everything done no problem um 'cause it not too difficult just time-consuming um and um it should be okay if just get up early and get little bit done before leave with my friend to go shopping and then whenever come back then can finish the rest and i'm meeting with someone to go over uh one of my psats so that'll definitely help as well um 'cause that'll ensure that it get done on time and everything um so that'll be nice today was all right um got all my work done although i'm just little bit behind on things because didn't really do anything yesterday and should have especially 'cause tomorrow have an extremely busy day so don't know if i'll have any time um to really do homework which is bad 'cause have pretty big assignment due tuesday and lot of reading have to do for another class on on tuesday um so overall i've been pretty busy plus i'm not feeling super well um which isn't good because have so many things to get done and do hope that start feeling better before thursday because have um big party to just to go to with all my friends to one of my friends birthdays um so really want to be in good place to have good time so would have to try and get all of my other stuff done ahead of time hopefully can do it but on wednesday [inaudible] only have one class and work that [inaudible] doing an work until friday or saturday so that have little extra time it disappointing because needed to go shopping today so [inaudible] plans um so probably won't go shopping [inaudible] this party and if do it'll have to be briefly [inaudible] [21] store in the area which [sucks] and not too much [inaudible] on it because have quite few [inaudible] so hopefully i'll still be able to find something and hopefully everything will turn out all right in the end especially with the party today has not been going well stayed up way too late last night because of my roommate um and had really busy day today so didn't get done lot of the things that wanted to get done um which resulted in me staying [up lot] later because also had extracurriculars had to go to um and even when came back my roommate was distracting me and [inaudible] so was basically unable to finish my homework so i'm still awake trying to finish an assignment that due at 1000 am tomorrow do has busy day tomorrow as well um basically i'll be busy until after o'clock so hopefully an time after that can just finish my last bit of homework as did most of it in advance for wednesday and go to bed really early 'cause i'm already feeling sick and i've gotten no sleep for the past three night uh which isn't good today didn't go too well just really felt sick and tired so ended up sleeping again past two of my classes did go to the afternoon one still feel bad for missing the other two um other than that did have meeting with my therapist and that went really nicely um it was really helpful and we scheduled another one in the future which will be nice um and then had dinner with my um working group tonight which was fun it go like really long most of the time uh then got back and managed to get all of my work done and [inaudible] to bed early to make up for all the sleep that i've been missing these past few days uh so hopefully tomorrow can either get up early if feel up to it or just on time [inaudible] [constructive] 'cause need to go to work and get few things done and then have dance practice in the evening on thursday if not um plan [inaudible] as well so need to try and finish all my homework for friday early so plan to get everything done tomorrow between like 500 and 800 when have time because have to go to work or i'll just work an hour and then pick up an hour on saturday to make it up so we'll see but hopefully it will be good today was all right i'm still feeling really sick so had to skip dance practice but hopefully i'll be able to make that up have practicing only [inaudible] going to practice on saturday um because my performance is next weekend so have to really kinda be on top of it do kinda regret missing it but feel like if had gone would most likely thrown up so it better overall that didn't go um and hopefully i'll be feeling lot better at the night of the performance also really need to try and [inaudible] in preparation for my [inaudible] um but keep forgetting to make an appointment am not sure when would have the free time to do that so [inaudible] can do little bit more i'm excited for tomorrow uh 'cause i'm going to um an friend party and celebrate my friend birthday so it should be lot of fun got to do lot of shopping today [inaudible] dress but [inaudible] stuff [inaudible] so it pretty flattering and something style don't know really well [inaudible] feeling little bit more confident about it and um i've already got an of my homework done for friday so i'll just have to finish it little bit [inaudible] tomorrow and i'll be all set and not have to stress the only thing is that do have to get up early on friday for class and will have to [inaudible] party more so than usual but that will be really awesome and i'm also really happy today 'cause got box in the mail from my mom on tuesday and got to talk to her on the phone for little bit which was really nice 'cause know she been having hard time and i've kind of been having hard time which was [inaudible] to speak with her it was super refreshing and um then friend even came over to my room later which was also really nice um it someone that i'm gonna be blocking with so like hanging out spending time with him tonight was pretty nice went to party with some of my really close friends and had pretty good time although was kind of sad because someone invited didn't end up showing up and really wish that they had but on the plus side um one of the guys in my [art] class um talked to me and i'm pretty sure they super into me which is really nice to know um because haven't had someone that had crush on me in while and so they exciting and hopefully i'll get to have lunch with him or something like that some time 'cause [inaudible] before but i'm busy so hopefully he'll ask me again 'cause otherwise i'll have to [ring] him and don't really want to hmm but other than that i'm little stressed because have some homework due tomorrow that haven't quite finished don't really know if i'm gonna finish they but they shouldn't be too bad 'cause they only one assignment and i've gotten all of the other work for that class done so they should be okay and hopefully i'll get up when need to get up at o'clock which is what i'm setting my alarm for um so that should be all right at least but we'll just have to see how they goes in the morning 'cause hopefully i'll get all my lab work done and um goes to math which even if just goes to turn in my homework they should be okay because pretty much know what we're doing in math but we'll see today was all right um got really sick so didn't go to any of my classes um so just spent the day doing homework and he relaxing in my dorm and then the night time spent with friends partying um and wasn't planning on drinking but did end up drinking so now feel more sick than did but hopefully tomorrow it will be okay 'cause need to go to work and also have dance practice and quite bit of homework that need to get done um so hopefully can do it all by the deadline 'cause have something due at noon and on at 500 on sunday and then everything else is due on tuesday um so i'm really glad that we have monday off even though have some extra dance practice to get to but hopefully tomorrow i'll have all the [inaudible] time to rehearse on my own perform on practice we'll just have to see how the day uh work out especially 'cause i've gotta go to work and don't really want to 'cause i'm not really feeling well but hopefully it will be okay 'cause only have to work for like two hours and can get back to whatever else today was all right still haven't been feeling well [i took] my medicine but it didn't really help um had to go to work um uh which really made me just feel lot worse than had before and other than that had um dance practice which was okay um i'm just yeah looking forward to the show but i'm also nervous about it because need to practice and i'm also super busy um which makes it more difficult um and just my homework is really getting the best of me because haven't been feeling well which makes it hard to focus have so many assignments coming up but hopefully we can get on top of them tomorrow tried to stay up tonight to do them but it just seems like really can't focus or get anything done [inaudible] so think i'll i'll just go to bed and i'll [inaudible] try [inaudible] reasonable time um but i'm not sure that i'll even be able to focus then and may not get all of my assignments turned in which sucks [inaudible] today wasn't super great um didn't get to bed until late last night um so woke up late and didn't completely finish all my homework but did get it done it all done um but felt really sick worse than have been feeling so ended up taking quite long nap um and didn't feel much better when woke up which definitely sucked but um i'll just yeah how it happens sometimes i've got super busy day tomorrow as well have quite bit of homework that i'm gonna have to catch up on so hopefully won't be feeling as bad and if do still not feel super great i'll probably try and um go to [hohs] some time but don't know fully that i'll have time to tomorrow 'cause i've i've gotta get up and do homework in the morning then i've got meetings dance practice and other extracurricular event so it definitely gonna be super busy and dance practice in particular is gonna be hard um since i've been feeling sick but have got to go [over it] so i've got because we have my shows coming up this weekend and can't not be there for that so hopefully will get better if not don't know what i'm gonna do today went perfectly well got up on time got some work done that had to do and met with my professor [inaudible] which went better than thought it was going to um and then had little bit more free time to do some homework that didn't initially think that would be uh able to do and so got that done but [inaudible] costume so [inaudible] that and then [inaudible] the downside is that am not doing super [inaudible] dance need to practice little more and my [inaudible] is on thursday so that little stressful and since i've been sick it definitely made it lot more difficult um to practice and to be on top of it in rehearsal also we was having some extra rehearsal um so that actually definitely helped 'cause there was only few things that need to work out to be prepared and other than that just need to send my homework so that can um not be stressed out when have to dance today was all right was pretty tired but made it to class on time got all my assignments in um and had fairly good day got some stuff in the mail which was super awesome 'cause had been expecting it um didn't have time however to finish my homework before had to go to dance practice but that should still be all right because um have more free time tomorrow 'cause only have one class so even though i'm getting to bed late hopefully my day will be little bit more relaxed and can get to bed early 'cause don't actually have anything to do on thursday for once which is blessing um and am super excited because had dance practice tonight dress rehearsal and it went really well so had been super nervous the night before but am slightly less nervous because actually semi-know what i'm doing which is really awesome feeling um to have just because i've been working for this for so long and now it finally actually happening my show is in two day and i'm [inaudible] because we're also having some extra practice tomorrow which will help me to go over dance one especially which am still struggling with little bit so hopefully i'll get it all down and then just have to prepare for busy week next week today went pretty well only had one class um so made it on time and had fairly good time 'cause got to work with someone that like um so that was fun and then after that had to meet up with someone from my sorority uh uh which was pretty good [inaudible] to meet her you know and she friends with someone else know which was super [valuable] to find help um and then [inaudible] had to [inaudible] and oh got job offer which was also awesome but it all makes it really hard for me to decide what want to do with my [family and everybody else waiting] back home but feel i'm not sure if should stay um and work but am worried feel like i've [inaudible] things to [inaudible] but feel like it also worth it to stay here and do this for the summer but i've got little bit of time to decide um 'cause have other things to worry about 'cause i've got dance performances starting tomorrow [inaudible] saturday and have paper due next tuesday midterm monday and another midterm tuesday that am definitely less than prepared for um which is unfortunate but all can do now is um study really really hard on sunday um to try and be ready for it and hope for the best um and other than that it going okay i'm not doing terribly well in my class but i'm also not doing terribly so hopefully it'll get better after spring break when have little bit of time to relax this time i'm gonna try and go back home [inaudible] today went really well um my classes were fine not great but fine and um got chance to practice my dance during the day which were fun um and then we had my first performance this evening which were really cool um were little bit nervous so did mess up tad bit but nothing major so were super happy about that and looking forward to doing all of the other performance so i've got one tomorrow and two on saturday the only downside is that have lot of stuff due next week um but hopefully can take some time to catch up on all of it tomorrow um 'cause dance doesn't get [inaudible] um so then can come home and and do some work and on saturday same thing which might take some work up there with me working on my essay or studying for my midterms um 'cause i've got two midterms next week as well um and other than that um also have to do some application that due by sunday that i'm really excited about 'cause am hoping get the job so we'll see how that goes today went pretty well my first class was nice worked with someone that really enjoy working with felt like like pretty much understood the material but do have test on tuesday that i'm definitely not ready for as well as test on monday and an essay i'm not [inaudible] ready for and my [inaudible] um starts uh it ships this weekend tried show tonight that went really well um but was upset because after it um it lost one of the pieces of my costume so had to let my choreographer know um luckily she was really nice about it anyway i'm gonna try and get it worked out tomorrow 'cause i've got two show um 'cause don't don't have to get up super early but just little early um might try to be earlier so can go grab yogurt and coffee um just from the shop in my dorm um instead of getting breakfast before go and i'm considering taking an of the work to do 'cause have to watch an entire move um to write response to by sunday so definitely stressed just need to get through all this stuff and then i'll have nice break at spring break so just gotta push through hopefully i'll be able to focus on my study for my test and everything do pretty well today was good uh my last day of [redacted] um which was fun um both performances went really well and got to see quite few of my friends which was really awesome um and managed to get some work that need to get done finished but tomorrow i'm gonna have to um do quite bit as well just 'cause i've got two tests and some essay that i'm little behind on because i've spent so much time on the [redacted] stuff um but it should still go all right at least and uh we'll just we'll have to see um um i'm not really sure but have been really stressed and busy um so i'm glad that spring break coming up 'cause i've already booked my flight home so that'll just be some time to recuperate and come back to um really be on top of it for the next semester but don't know and i'm still debating my summer plans 'cause have few options and i'm not sure which one will be best um 'cause wanna see my family but also need to do stuff for my future um career so i'm probably gonna end up staying on campus all summer but we'll see today didn't go pretty well at all um was feeling pretty depressed and my back was hurting 'cause of all of the dance that i've been doing so basically um slept in late and then spent the whole day in my bed working on stuff um it pretty difficult 'cause didn't get to meet with my tutor so was having really tough time with some of my homework and am still working on it and didn't get enough done 'cause i've got midterm tomorrow that am definitely not prepared for and midterm and some essay on tuesday neither of which i'm prepared for so i'm definitely extremely stressed out but know that after get done with these two day everything will slow down again and then i'll have spring break where hopefully can take some time to get back on top of everything 'cause i'm really excited to see my family 'cause i'll be going home for about eight day which is short amount of time but still fun so it should be nice today [wasn't good] day didn't feel super great and definitely should have gotten more sleep stayed up late doing homework um and was tired basically all day long um which wasn't great 'cause had midterm today which wasn't really ready for so missed one of my other classes um because was studying for the midterm um which isn't good 'cause it the same classes that missed two weeks ago and the midterm for that classes is coming up too guess just need to prioritize better um especially because was busy with my dance performance this weekend which really cut into study time still feel like it was worth it um also have midterm uh tomorrow that haven't studied for at all because was preparing for the other midterm and my essay that was due so everything is just piling up but it okay 'cause tomorrow is my last super busy day and then hopefully can come down focus get back on top of everything and [inaudible] all right my friend is coming this saturday so hopefully seeing her will be okay um and maybe i'll get to go shopping with my roommate which i've been wanting to do for about month and half um 'cause really need to get some stuff and then have um to finalize some summer plans which i'm gonna work on doing and i've got some interview for job opportunity that really hope that get because have been wanting it for basically the last semester so hopefully that'll go well today was all right um woke up and was pretty exhausted 'cause had trouble getting to sleep last night uh but still managed to get to all my classes and they was all right um did have test this evening that wasn't really ready for um and feel like they went mildly okay [inaudible] great or anything um only have one classes tomorrow which will be nice 'cause also have to go to work and i'm planning on um watching two films for classes so hopefully i'll get to see some of my friends [inaudible] um and i'm supposed to have lunch date with someone which could be fun but could just be super awkward so we'll see um stayed up little bit later than wanted to because started working on some personal stuff but they was pretty relaxing so guess they was worth they today was all right woke up late but only have one class and that went okay but somehow frustrated 'cause whenever asked her helped on my work um my ca didn't actually help me um and just chatted with some other people um which is definitely frustrating but luckily had meeting with my tutor later on so she explained things little bit more clearly um other than that had um fun lunch date that was really nice and really enjoyed talking to the girl that met with um and after that went to work for bit uh which was hard 'cause did-didn't have enough time to finish everything wanna do today um so have to go back on friday but it shouldn't be too bad and then saturday my friend is supposed to be coming here from texas but haven't heard from her so we'll see what happens with that 'cause have lot of things that need to do otherwise the mid-term [inaudible] sunday and then later we'll [inaudible] so [inaudible] the regular homework on top of that [inaudible] is coming for class next week um and they're really gonna do shopping this weekend [inaudible] guess we'll just have to see what have time for which is like it not going to be lot sadly but guess that whatever um and also went to watch party for class tonight which was nice 'cause got to see two of my friend there which was really cool 'cause one of her didn't even know was in the class and so [inaudible] [inaudible] got pretty bad headache so it gonna be hard to focus on anything after that today was all right woke up late but still managed to get to class on time which was nice and then got lunch with friend um that normally we never have meals together so that was really cool um didn't do great in math class today but should be better tomorrow we'll see um and then later had to book some flights and file some financial information which was all very stressful um but at least it done now and now still have lot of stuff to do so i'm just glad spring break coming up but before can go on spring break have to write midterm essay um that definitely haven't even started um so i'll probably do class and work and homework tomorrow and saturday one of my friend is supposed to be coming but haven't heard from her so we'll see and if she doesn't might go shopping or if doesn't i'll probably just try and get my midterm started we'll see today was fine keep not being able to fall asleep at night which is strange little bit of an issue [inaudible] tired the next day um so woke up late but still made it to class on time um and then only had one other class and had an time in-between that was planning on going to work but the weather was super bad so didn't and after that just ended up um doing an homework which was still good i'm hoping to manage to get little bit of homework done tonight because tomorrow i'm planning on going shopping and i'll also have to make up the work that couldn't do today tomorrow um but it should still be all right do have quite few assignments 'cause next week is going to be really busy and i've got an interview and another event on sunday which means that the majority of my homework will have to be done tomorrow and so hopefully i'll be able to focus and really do it there also party that might wanna go to but we'll see what happens still need to check in and see if any of my friends is going 'cause if they're not then probably won't either but hopefully actually get up on time to go shopping since i'm going to bed later than planned again um but still should still be all right good day it was really fun woke up pretty early went shopping with my roommate and just got to spend little too much money but think have lot of things that really really like so guess it was huge [inaudible] still um other than that spent the afternoon relaxing and doing homework [inaudible] to work today which was good um and then spent the evening going out 'cause my roommate wanted to which didn't plan on doing but it turned out to be lot of fun 'cause got to see lot of friends and also meet lot of really nice new people um and ran into my old ca-captain who gave me advice for an interview that i've got tomorrow which was super awesome 'cause i've been worried about it but um it was really good to to talk to him um 'cause now i'm feeling kinda more confident about doing the interview and i'm really really hoping that get the job 'cause it will just be awesome so we'll see how it goes um and then uh i've got quite bit of homework and test stuff to get ready but can pace it out little bit um so that don't have to do all of it tomorrow um should should still be okay especially 'cause spring break is coming up and if i'm able to focus back home i'll be able to get lot of stuff done then as well which will be really awesome and also getting to see my family it gonna be great literally cannot wait today was okay woke up on time so had time to shower and get ready before had to go to my interview um my interview went fairly well um was little bit rattled at the end because it was [interrupted] but it still went all right and i'm really hoping that get the job because it would be really good for me but was also glad 'cause found out that can work um for the same place over the summer which would be nice 'cause think i'll be um staying on campus over the summer instead of going back home which will be really stressful and know my family is gonna be super upset i'm gonna have to let them know when go home for spring break but feel like it definitely worth it 'cause get to take class and um work to make money and uh just get to spend time sort of figuring out life for myself without having other stresses uh such as my family and my roommate and things like that so hopefully the summer will be really really productive um [inaudible] not as nice because have meeting today so i'm glad got my homework done at reasonable time though am little bit worried 'cause have midterm that about to be due that haven't even started and i've got quiz and an exam but um hopefully it'll all be all right we'll see today was pretty good woke up on time and got ready and was little bit more dressed up today um [math] was okay it was little frustrating because um uh we didn't really get anything done that would actually help us on our [psat] which was frustrating um and then went to our other class which was also um not productive because it class where you really don't actually have to go to lecture to know what going on um but did get some other stuff done during that time um and then spent the evening with some friends we went out to dinner which wasn't great but it was okay um then had um some [inaudible] after that which is why am now working on our homework so late um because wasn't able to earlier tomorrow is also gonna be super busy have quiz that haven't studied for but do have some hour before the quiz that can use to look up for some information so hopefully it'll still go all right and i'm getting our midterm back tomorrow graded um so we'll see how that turns out because don't think that did particularly well on it but who know hopefully just did well enough today was all right um and we've been to to class this morning and it was okay um had paper back that did pretty well on so was [inaudible] about that got test back as well that didn't do so well on um but did okay enough and i'm gonna talk about it with one of my tfs 'cause think there are some issues with how it was graded um other than that i'm kinda stressed out 'cause have lot of stuff to do and not lot of time to do it especially 'cause it housing day so will want to be to focus on that rather than do my work but have got mid-term too that quite bit of reading usually in lot of different sources mm which can be little bit uh stressful um but it should be all right because have been keeping up fairly well with semester um so hopefully it will end up going okay um and it worth like 30 of my grade so long as pass it it pretty good grade then can do better on the final um i'm just really looking forward to having fun with my [blockmates] um so it should be good today has been pretty good um class went okay and then went to work which was really nice um and then had to focus on work because has quite bit to do and tomorrow is housing day um so i'm going after [school] after i'm working really need to get more stuff done tonight but i'm also hanging out with my friends for housing day so i'm not getting done as much as wanted to but luckily finished some of my other friday homework so really only has to focus on single assignment although it pretty major one that takes quite bit of work so hopefully i'll still be able to finish it was also pumped because got some really good news this evening that got the job had been wanting so i'll be looking forward to doing that um later in the spring and looked into class i'm gonna takes over the summer so i'm feeling little bit more excited about that am pretty stressed but i'm also very very very ready to get back home to my family and am super excited to find out what house we're gonna live in for [inaudible] in just few hours and think it'll be the house for the next three years with my blockmates so that should be fun and we're having really good evening um might [drink] later but i'm not sure should 'cause really need to focus on my work so we'll see what happens today was all right um went to bed super late last night and woke up super early because it was housing day um which was lot of fun but also wasn't great because had lot of work to get done and barely any time to do it because we had [semi] events so am little bit frustrated that my teachers made stuff due today um when it also knew that it was housing day so stayed up this late because had to finish really important assignment and midterm and i'm honestly not too certain on how well did on it but guess all can do is wait and see now um and i've got lot to do tomorrow because i'm heading back home on saturday and i've got an sat sunday for another one of my classes so i'm gonna have to go to my classes tomorrow go shopping and get packing and prepare to go home and my [plane] is super early so it'll involve me waking up at ridiculous time or just not getting any sleep at all so we'll just see whatever happens um and hopefully my flight not delayed or canceled or anything because am ready to be home for week today was all right and really didn't get any sleep last night 'cause was studying [inaudible] mid-term um so that wasn't good 'cause was went to class exhausted and [inaudible] proud of it and didn't really know what was going on with the class um but managed to get through it and then had lab which actually went pretty well um [inaudible] kinda talk about it [inaudible] some extra studying for that course which hope catch up on some of my work over spring break but it is only week which seems like no time and i'm gonna have to try and see all of my family and friends especially 'cause i'm not gonna be back home over the summer at all basically um [inaudible] be difficult mm-hmm am very stressed 'cause have to try and make it to my plane on time and it leaves early and i've got some essay that due sunday at midnight and haven't even started yet and i'm gonna do some reading to catch up on it but i'll see how it goes it shouldn't be too bad should be able to work on it at home if have to um and then other than that um i'm just not feeling well 'cause i'm tired i've gotten no sleep so i'm really trying to sleep for bit before have to leaves super early um to make it to my plane on time um and this week off will be nice do have few things that have to get done [over] it other than schoolwork but should still have good time being back with my family today was pretty good because was heading home for spring break um got few things done that needed to get done and then had an extension on something that was due at midnight um which was good because was having trouble getting the software to work 'cause it was an online things and it little bit more stuff set up for my job this summer which was great 'cause was worried about doing that um the only downside is that have an essay due tomorrow night that still haven't been able to start because was spent lot of the day on the plane traveling um so i'll just have to write the whole things tomorrow but it shouldn't be too bad other than that finally got to see my family which is awesome but had to [inaudible] 'cause wouldn't be home at all over the summer and it took it pretty well probably better than expected but it was still really difficult um but i'm still definitely gonna do the summer program because it super beneficial for me but it did open up the possibility of people coming to visit me which would be super cool 'cause i'm really hoping that maybe we can get that to happen since won't be home at all really mean max maybe week or two so that would be really awesome if someone could come visit me instead today was pretty nice i'm back home with my family for break so got to sleep in whole bunch woke up few times at night but it wasn't too bad um and felt really great today after sleeping for so long um but also [inaudible] unexpected tonight turned it in little bit late because forgot about the times zone difference and think it probably not super good but it was only rough draft so i'm looking forward to improving it in the future tomorrow should be all right 'cause have um [work bit but] it won't be all day long and hopefully while i'm there can get few assignments or um club stuff finished so we'll see how that goes today woke up little bit late 'cause went to bed super late last night um wasn't feeling super well but that okay and had to go to work so did that and just napped in the car before and after work which was nice and it was cool 'cause got to spend the day with my mom and one of her employees who actually really good at his job so don't mind working with him because he tries hard and he knows what he doing um other than that probably should've worked this homework today but decided to take break um and not do anything which means should really get stuff done tomorrow but we'll see whe-whether or not that happens um i'm also trying to make plans with my friends to hanging out since won't be coming home at all over the summer so this is the only time that i'll get to see her until next winter so um hopefully we'll be able to make plans even though don't wanna spend too much time with her 'cause i'd rather spend the time with my family members we'll just see what happens today was all right and then got got my hair cut finally which was nice since haven't done that since like before winter um other than that had to work um which you know was okay got my knees and hips really started hurting so i'm gonna have to go to the chiropractor tomorrow to um get an adjustment which will definitely make me sore for about day but it will also really help um i'm also going to hang out with my friends tomorrow which you know should be okay but i'm not like super looking forward to it or anything because lot of it is sad but whatever um just know that won't see them at all after break so kinda have to hang out with them now um we is going shopping which will be nice since [inaudible] that don't need to spend too much money so hopefully can have self-control but we'll we'll just have to see and then i'm spending the night with my grandmother which will be lot of fun so i'm looking forward to that today was pretty good woke up not feeling super well but other than that um i'm [inaudible] go to work that was okay um and [inaudible] thought like little bit [inaudible] nothing too bad [inaudible] really manageable um and had plans to go to [inaudible] afterward so had to work all day um and [inaudible] glad to hang out with my friends hadn't been too excited about it when first made the plans 'cause actually [inaudible] them it was lot of fun so was really happy that did it 'cause [inaudible] get chance to see see [inaudible] again before have to go back to school um i'm [looking] to see one of them but probably not both um have [inaudible] another friends on friday but that will probably be less fun so am glad went tonight although probably did end up spending little bit too much money definitely more than had planned on spending or wanted to spend but it was probably worth it um so that nothing too bad um other than that have some things due tomorrow so have to work on that um have to get my homework finished because it not too long now before i'm gonna have to go back to school so i'll spend tomorrow at work and doing homework do have to get up kind of early later than lot of the other day i've been getting up so it shouldn't be too bad last night spent the night over at my grandmother um this morning got to sleep in little bit later before heading home to work which was nice but in the night got nosebleed which was not fun at all so think i'm gonna try and start doing the nose sprays whenever that stops happening 'cause it happened at school few times even though went to the doctor about it and he didn't really tell me anything to do um so that was frustrating but other than that work was okay did sort of get into fight with my father about some work stuff um so that didn't go over well but the rest of the evening was enjoyable 'cause just worked with my mom and my brother and some employees and the employees was catching on more than thought so that always nice to see um and then my aunt and uncle came by and hadn't gotten to see them yet so that was really cool got to talk for bit i'm not sure i'll see them again before leave for [redacted] but it did mention coming to visit me this summer which would actually be really happy about 'cause i've been trying to convince family members to come and visit me since i'll be spending all summer not being home um so if it do and few other do that would be really cool um it always nice to see them and had plans to hang out with friend tomorrow but he had to cancel last minute so he changed it to saturday instead which will actually end up working out better um and [could] put little bit more of times frame on it 'cause don't wanna end up hanging out with them for super long times 'cause when went to hang out with friend the other night it ended up being for few hours and hadn't intended it to be that long so hopefully this one will be lot more doable um because my main goal is still to spend times with my family before anyone else so i'm am like seeing my friend but [really wanna make] more of some effort to see my family members um so having limited times to be able to hang out really helps that quite bit um so that should be good today um woke up [inaudible] super tired because went to bed late last night again um and went to work but fell asleep in the [class] [inaudible] ended up not going in until like 1030 which is basically when we open but it was still fine um then didn't feel too great during the workday because um i'm feeling [a little] like cramps and stuff um so that was little bit frustrating and then because i'm working with new employees it don't really know what they're doing yet which means that have to work lot harder to make sure everything goes out right and on time doing my own job while um watching them and doing quality control but did get to see some relatives and some of my other family friends that came at the restaurant which was kind of nice um then afterward we um went out for dinner but it was super late so was just tired and grouchy and really out of it um and hopefully tomorrow i'll be hanging out with my friends and hopefully can leave work early to do some homework because we've been so busy at work that haven't been able to do any of what wanted to get done which definitely sucks so uh if not possible i'll just [inaudible] work late tomorrow to do my homework since i'm going back to school on sunday today woke up not feeling too well again because of cramps and stuff um so took little bit longer than thought would to get ready um but really just since wasn't feeling well perhaps that uh and work and did spend the morning [following] more slowly and not really helping out as much um because took some medicine and tried to sit down for bit then when felt better started helping out more which is good and then hang out with one of my friends slightly later in the day which is good because needed to see him before leave left um tomorrow and we had fun time going around got present for my roommate and have some other stuff for my [blockmates] so that'll be nice for when go back um but on the downside i'm really behind on the homework that was supposed to do over break so i'm gonna have to try and do it tomorrow while spending time with all of the family that didn't get to see otherwise so hopefully have time to finish everything because i'm gonna be pretty exhausted so going back to school and immediately being exhausted so it not going to be the best thing to happen today was getting ready to leave and go back to school but then it turned out that my flight was delayed so just switched it to tomorrow which is little bit more difficult because had to turn in all of my homework online so hopefully the teachers will still accept it since couldn't really control my flight um but we'll see when it email me back tomorrow have presentation in class on tuesday that i'm kind of nervous about and got quite few things to get done right when get back to campus um so i'm definitely really stressed and honestly i'm at point where don't even want to go back to school which is really difficult for me because [i'd been away] since december and i'm it really not good because know that need to do it just have to find the motivation i'm not sure what going on but think i'm gonna try and talk to my therapist about it the next time meet with her and maybe i'll figure it out today returned back to school um so had to wake up really early and go to the airport which was okay but really wasn't feeling well which made it difficult especially being on plane for so long so when finally did get to school was not feeling well at all and ended up just showering and taking nap which was not good because have lot of homework to do um but then later when um woke up had extracurricular things so did that came home and hang out with some friends so ended up staying up pretty late to do my homework but did nap well so it should be okay and hopefully can spend little bit of time napping tomorrow because only have one class on wednesday so definitely need to catch up on my sleep and try and get back into the routine of school and catch up on the work that i'm behind in um but i'm also really excited because we're having big little week this week with my sorority and think it'll be super awesome um already got some email from my big and we start getting gifts and stuff on wednesday so i'm really looking forward to that um and have plans with my friends for friday night and thursday evening so hopefully that'll all be super fun and lastly have presentation tomorrow that i'm little bit stressed about but it should be okay because have partner and we prepared for it um other than that hopefully i'll just be able to wake up on time since still haven't finished my homework and i'm already really sleepy today was just good woke up on time made it to class on time but didn't have time to shower this morning but it okay 'cause showered last night um [so that was still fine] um and then was gonna have lunch but feel like [inaudible] not good anymore so did still eat some of it but not [inaudible] doing um and other than that had class and went shopping and cleaned up my room because someone supposed to be coming over tomorrow [inaudible] did my homework in semi-timely fashion probably could've focused little bit more 'cause kept getting distracted but still got it done and feel like it went really well so i'm pretty pleased about that um especially 'cause had really productive workshop where felt like my [ca] really helped me understand some stuff had been having trouble with which was awesome hmm and i'm expecting to get pretty major grade or two [inaudible] tomorrow so we'll see how that goes and did get [inaudible] grade back today that felt like was pretty good all things considered so that was nice um and then also have plans on friday with my friends which will hopefully work out because think it'll be lot of fun today was pretty good woke up with plenty of time and only had one class and it went really well 'cause got to work with people that really enjoy working with and feel like we was really productive and really understood what was going on and then went for my tutoring and finished almost the entire pset which was absolutely awesome because then i'll have less work tomorrow especially 'cause i'm little bit behind with my next [inaudible] so i'll need to refocus little bit um and also had work today and worked for longer than normal which was actually really nice because i'll make little bit more money um when get my next paycheck um which is cool and then other than that got [inaudible] for my new [inaudible] today which was super duper awesome and just really nice to have someone more [inaudible] present in your room for you and did make some plans um with friends um to possibly go out together so i'll be looking forward to that [inaudible] um tomorrow supposed to be quite cold and snowy so hopefully i'll wake up in enough time to shower early so my hair won't freeze on the way to class again but we'll see because intend to sleep in as long as possibly can um yeah that why get the most of my stuff prepared the night before so hopefully it won't be too bad in the morning today was pretty good was little bit late to class but not too bad um and it was really productive period felt like really got ahead on my work and had meeting with the teacher that was little apprehensive about but feel like it went fairly well and hopefully can be prepared for the next test and my next class and everything tomorrow will be little bit busy just because have my really long lab and need to do some stuff beforehand to get ready for it but i'm also meeting with another teacher um but it'll be good because it go over some work that gonna be do next tuesday um and feel like i'm fairly well prepared know need to do little bit more search for some evidence but that shouldn't factor too much into my discussion tomorrow because that just something that know have to get done um and hopefully i'll be able to schedule time to go the writing center before have to turn in the paper which means i'll have to stay on top of it i'm planning on devoting most of my saturday to working i'll probably leave the room and go study somewhere else can really focus um other than that already did work this week because wanted to do that [inaudible] which is good because that gives me more time for homework um which i've really been trying to stay on top of and then there was also party tomorrow evening that said would go to but i'm still debating gonna see what my other friends decide so probably [inaudible] off that just be haven't really been feeling up to the party mood um so we'll we'll just have to see and hopefully can get everything done before the lab tomorrow 'cause don't have too much time because i've got class and meeting before it um today woke up pretty late because got to sleep in um from last night which was definitely kind of mess um but had lot to get done because have bunch of stuff due for sunday um but one of the things that needed to watch it [inaudible] for class um and that definitely took long time so did that did some of my other work um but also took nap since wasn't feeling too well so probably should've gotten some more done but do have meeting with someone tomorrow so i'll finish homework then and then i'll shouldn't it shouldn't be too difficult to get my other homework done hopefully but we'll see am definitely worried about money have been working but i'm worried that it still not gonna be enough um 'cause now have extra due for stuff but we'll see how it goes i'll try and work extra this week worked extra last week too and was supposed to get paid for the study i'm doing but haven't and [it time] end up asking about that as well just because definitely don't wanna be short on money today was pretty good um was really busy with my homework but did get it done even though it was pretty late when fi-finished um but other than that just had little some small frustrations [with friend] um there was some drama back home with my family but should be okay can talk to my mom and my little sisters [a lot] um but other than that was just trying to get all my work done so hopefully [inaudible] [so all my stuff isn't] going too well um and have pretty busy few weeks coming up and all the [inaudible] always seem to be busy but at least i'm excited tomorrow because i'm gonna have little segment to find out who my date is although the timing is kind of poor because have [inaudible] event at the same time that won't be able to go to um but hopefully it is still okay think can make up for other event that have to miss by going to [inaudible] later hopefully um and i'm just really stressed about assignments due on tuesday other than that i'm pretty much on top of my stuff more or less that is um but should be able to talk to my professor bit about this essay um and can try to go to the writing center if need to hopefully just [inaudible] me to be able to really be on top of it 'cause sometimes you just have to get into the mindset to be able to write something well so we'll see how it go um but yeah other than that don't really know just gotta you know get some stuff done hmm today was lot of fun um went to my classes on time woke up ahead of time didn't feel too tired or anything although didn't feel super well this morning it wasn't too bad um so think overall the day went really well had really good time because in the evening had lot of um plans and it was lot of fun um got to hang out with [inaudible] he comes with friend of mine and got to hang out with my other um good friend which was super nice 'cause we made plans for this weekend um and had few surprises today had little get-together in my honor which was quite fun um and then spent the evening working on my essay which was definitely struggle but feel like it ended up in really good place um so i'm feeling pretty solid about what submitted and really looking forward to getting it back 'cause know won't have it back for few weeks um have kind of busy day tomorrow um especially 'cause had to reschedule meeting with my teacher for tomorrow rather than doing it later in the weeks like had wanted to but hopefully that goes all right because don't have too many things that have to goes over with her um so she'll only take about 30 minutes and then i'm [inaudible] train to get to my work definitely early since have handful of classes on wednesday so that can goes to work and focus on doing some laundry and some other stuff um and then hopefully spend little time uh talking to my family members which got to do today but not too much so it although today it was also pretty busy in addition need to start studying because have tests coming up next weeks and definitely want to do better on the second exams than did on the first ones so i've been trying to focus on studying lot today has been all right um woke up and got to sleep in little later since had all my stuff ready for class last night um which was really nice since stayed up so late working on my essay and then talked to few people from the same class felt better because they had said that they also spent quite bit of time on their essay as well and had to stay up late um so thought that was pretty good sign um other than that had two class and they all went fine as well but did feel little bit out of they and disconnected from my family today but has had decent [inaudible] before so know that i'll probably be better tomorrow um and even if not they fine i'll just go about my work 'cause i've got [inaudible] my job tomorrow um and i've got two tests coming up next week so i'm trying to be on top of that and has friend who wants to hang out this weekend and i'm really looking forward to going out with their so hopefully we are able to do that but we'll see today was still feeling pretty off even though went to bed really early last night ended up waking up pretty late anyway was almost late to class so guess i've just generally been feeling out bit but did get all my homework done for friday and [inaudible] some lab prep need to do that'll be [inaudible] tomorrow morning pretty busy um i'm glad that [inaudible] make lunch plans with some people that know um so that should be fun guess um [inaudible] might be little bit awkward but hopefully it'll turn out all right um and then [inaudible] so went to work today which was frustrating and awkward and even forgot to sign out so have to go back probably tomorrow or another day to fix that it should actually okay 'cause it'll only take like two minutes um and then i've been forgetting that need to do some stuff for another extra-curricular and that should've been done on saturday but should be able to finish before the actual date so that should be okay um other than that april definitely gonna been busy starting with two tests that have next week that haven't been um studying for but hopefully can dedicate saturday to that just need to get on top of some homework that due on sunday um so hopefully that'll be all right but don't really know we'll see just have to focus on and get out of this weird funk that i'm in today was all right was feeling little bit out of it but mostly on top of everything um got to class little bit late but it wasn't bad and showered this morning which was nice and had time to relax little bit then had lunch with some friends which turned out to be [inaudible] 'cause got to see uh well first got to meet someone new and then got to um see one of the friends had lunch with later in the day which was [inaudible] um other than that my other class was pretty good although didn't pay too much attention and probably should have 'cause have test coming up but [inaudible] test so it not that big of deal um then after that had more time to relax then got to hang out with some [inaudible] that really enjoy talking to so that was awesome um and then spent the evening with friends as well [inaudible] little bit frustrating but it got better afterwards because heard from friends back home that haven't heard from in while and we was having pretty good conversation but was really annoyed because it got interrupted but i'm sure that we'll finish it some other time 'cause know can rely on him and i'll definitely wanna talk to him about stuff because he someone that always gonna be there for me no matter what which appreciate because think he was probably one of the only friends that can consider to be like that um the weekend is definitely gonna be long because test preparation and my roommate have her girlfriend coming over which is gonna be annoying because she wants me to spend bunch of time with her which don't wanna [understand] whatever i'll probably just try and avoid the room or something and prepare for the two test have next week so we'll see how it goes today was all right wasn't feeling super well but classes wasn't too long and my stuff is relatively easy so had an okay time doing that um and then spent the evening relaxing we did get to hang out with friend which was good 'cause was supposed to see him last night and didn't but after that just was really having lot of trouble um was sort of dissociating and getting into down mood um but then called one of my friend from back home and he really helped lot so hopefully i'll do better um 'cause definitely wasted this evening and i've got two tests and an other stuff that needs to get done for next week um so i'm definitely gonna have to focus tomorrow since i've got fairly busy day on sunday um and i'm supposed to go to friend event tomorrow night too so we'll see what happens 'cause do really want to go but also know that needs to get my work done especially studying for this tests which didn't do super well on the last one um but was glad 'cause made few purchases 'cause got an good news about my finances so that'll help if anything else today definitely felt really out of it um just felt as if there was something really off um so did not get too much done which was difficult because i've got mid-term monday that i'm super worried about um so hopefully by the time wake up tomorrow i'll be feeling better because do have few things to do on top of the mid-term so hopefully can get everything done and be ready for um my test by studying just have [sort of] travel plan with [redacted] and some other friends um so i've been talking to people on the phone and trying to [get out] which is good but at the same time it takes up lot of time and should just be studying haven't been able to find good place to do that and be productive um it have been more difficult um but um i'll i'll i'll get through it really think this summer and next term will go lot better um and you know one of the main things i'm trying to do is just to distance myself from it all and stop being so concerned unless the partnerships is worth it um but we'll see how that actually go because can say that but actually doing that is completely other things um but i'm i'm definitely trying and just need to get out of this funk pretty quickly 'cause i've got busy day tomorrow today went pretty well had meeting this morning about work which was nice because got to find out more about what i'll be doing this summer um which was lot of fun but um other than that had um lot of homework to do because have mid-term tomorrow so spent like five hours studying for it and still don't feel prepared at all so i'll study lot more tomorrow as well um especially because today had to um do some extra homework as well so didn't totally dedicate all my time to studying so i'm gonna try and do that tomorrow since the test isn't until 700 pm and only have two classes but also have to wake up early because have some appointment so i'll see how it goes think the important appointment will goes really well think just because i'm gonna talk really seriously to my um therapist and have some stuff to do throughout the week so think this week will be good especially because i'm gonna get super busy starting this weekend so i'm wanna have this [super] relaxing week which it would be better because i'll get my last two test done this week and then just have to worry about finals coming up um so that will definitely help bring my stress levels down and then hopefully can make some time to goes to the chiropractor because my back have been acting up um but we'll just see [inaudible] and i'm just gonna deliberate about this test and hoping it goes well today was pretty good woke up early and had an appointment that actually turned out pretty well and talked of an stuff for the future uh [inaudible] stuff in the morning with an [clients] which was nice although was scared but it should be okay um mean [inaudible] with friend that haven't seen since like last semester so that was super awesome to get to catch up with that friend and then have plans for tomorrow morning uh so have to get up early once again um to see how that goes [inaudible] and then i'm gonna be heading off to [inaudible] so so started preparing for another [inaudible] through working out and stuff but also have well homework and things um to get done so we'll see how it goes um don't know but i'm really looking forward to going into [inaudible] so it'll be awesome actually um yeah [inaudible] just have to try and get an stuff done 'cause definitely have been pretty busy at the moment so we'll see today was pretty good had to wake up pretty early and go to meeting this morning um that ran little late so was almost late to my class but managed to make it just before it actually started which was good um and then was little bit tired but it okay because can sleep in little bit later tomorrow morning anyways so it not that big of deal um and on the plus side uh only have one class tomorrow but do have few other thing i'm going for an appointment with [inaudible] to address but that should be good just to get an medicine and then to make another appointment with [inaudible] which i've been trying to do for while and haven't had time so i'm happy that i'll finally get chance to do it tomorrow and then this weekend gonna be really busy which i'm not looking forward to but i'm happy because finally managed to book an appointment with the chiropractor even though it is for next week but after go to that should be feeling better um other than that i've got midterm thursday night that i'm little worried about but honestly feel i'll be prepared for which is cool because in the past haven't um and i'm meeting with my tutor tomorrow to go over an stuff as well which should help and other than that i've got to work tomorrow and um we've got friend coming over um which is pretty nice because never had dinner with my roommate and another friend that didn't know too well um managed to talk to him little bit which i'm hoping i'll kind of get to talk to him one on one in the future because he seems pretty nice and feel like we could be good friend but it kind of difficult 'cause i've found with my roommate she [inaudible] dominates the conversation so hopefully we'll get an chance to talk one on one instead so get to know him better we'll see today was pretty good had [inaudible] quiz this morning which was frustrating 'cause that one of my least favorite things to do in math um but it didn't go super poorly it was okay don't think i'll get [great grade] on that though because never contribute enough to my group um but i'm not too stressed about it after that um went to work which was really nice because that means i'm done for the week and i've got bunch of trainings and stuff this weekend so definitely had to get it done today um and got to talk to my family while was working bit which was great because hadn't spoken to my grandmother in while and also got to hear from my sister which was cool and then after that met up with my tutor to go over some math stuff and feel really prepared for the midterm which is great feeling because normally think i'm not ready but think could actually do [inaudible] and then after that had doctor appointment which was really good 'cause got lot of stuff um solved but ended up spending lot of money because had misconceptions about the cost of some stuff um which was not cool but guess i'll just have to make it up with work um which shouldn't be too bad and then [got to] spend the evening [meeting] with friends and went to dinner with some friends which was okay but then extra people joined us which was frustrating um but then [inaudible] we ha-hang out with someone that i've [inaudible] and she really cool so think we'll probably start hanging out little bit more which is really nice because feel like friends group is growing and i'm meeting some really awesome people that feel like could become really close to so that was really awesome and think tomorrow will be okay [inaudible] my days is gonna start getting really busy starting this weekend so it should be okay think can handle it today went all right had really good morning class even though was little bit late to it um but was really pleased because some of my friends asked me to lunch and didn't have to ask them this time which was super awesome 'cause we're all becoming closer and then uh we even had someone extra join me which was cool 'cause hadn't met them before so that was nice and he seems super chill um someone that easy to get along with other than that uh had few homework assignments but got them all done and then had mid-term this evening which thought was ready for but think messed up few time on the actual exam um but it okay think still did not too terribly um so i'll just do corrections and get some points back like that um other than that oh had tea tonight with friends with dinner which was good but at the same time we had dinner with someone um who very loud and my roommate also very loud and they're both super outgoing so it sort of dominated the whole conversation which is difficult for me because don't like talking over people so get to feel really disconnected when that happening um but maybe in the future i'll get to talk to them more one-on-one so feel more comfortable around them um and then it was good because heard from one of my friends back home who been through rough time right now though 'cause he broke up with his fiancee so talked to them for while and think helped them which was nice and then um we had friends over this evening so definitely ended up staying up way later than was planning on it but honestly feel like it was worth it especially 'cause going into this weekend i'm gonna have less time to hang out with friends now as get busier um so it was good to have this little um break and good to see people especially 'cause one of my other friends was also going through hard time so think it was also nice for them to see me and sort of take break and know that we're there for them so that was really cool today was okay we stayed up way too late last night so was [inaudible] [a bit] tired um but my first class was still fine and then had little time between that and my next class where got to relax and get few things done which was good um and then had lu lab which was little frustrating but we still managed to get out an hour early um so that was nice and then super exhausting but had to talk to friend for bit 'cause he going through rough time so i've been [getting him some] [inaudible] and then went to dinner with an other friend which was good except we was all so out of it barely even talked mostly just sat there and ate but was really happy because got to get an lemonade which had been wanting to do for while and and an cereal and stuff then we came home and just relaxed probably stayed up too late again but can sleep in little bit tomorrow because don't have anything until o'clock and then after that i'm gonna try and spend the whole evening doing homework um because sunday it going to be super-duper busy um so have to really get lot of stuff done tomorrow so hopefully will actually be able to focus and do that um other than that sort of made an impulse buying decision but feel like it'll turn out to be okay there something i've been wanting and managed to get it [on sale too] which was nice so hopefully that'll motivate me to do better um since treated myself little bit so we'll just see how tomorrow goes i'm gonna try and get up little early so have an time to shower and get an stuff done before have to goes to work um get trained for my new job which i'm pretty pumped about so it should be all right today turned out to be really good um decided to go out even though hadn't been planning on it because this morning woke up to little bit of work and then had training for my job coming up this spring um and after that um went back to the room and got my roommate because she been sick so took her to go um to the doctor and went in and got few things and it was lot of fun but know should probably do homework tonight because wasn't planning on going out but then everyone hadn't hung out with in while texted me so ended up going out with her and the party was all right didn't have too much of great time but it was still pretty fun and then had to get my friend home safely which did and then went to get pizza and it was super awesome because some random person just paid for my pizza so just got some free pizza um and then now i'm heading back to my dorm and i'm not feeling super well and have to get up early tomorrow which sucks but it should be all right because had really nice night so think it was worth going out um and then hopefully i'll have time to get all my stuff done tomorrow and if don't there just one little things that won't matter too much so it should be okay today had really busy day um spent the morning doing an extracurricular and right after that had to run to training for my job but it went really well um had great time and got to see one of my captains which was cool then had to run to tutor and to get my homework done uh which finished and managed to finish my other homework on time too and then had um another event to go to in the night but it was really cool because found out an great information about all the work starting at the beginning of the summer um like who my mentors are the hours where i'll be working stuff like that and i'm super excited about it and made plans to meet with my mentors later this week so that'll also be really good 'cause i'm ready to start preparing and heard from my sister um and we're going um to thing together so she was just sending me an information which made me really happy 'cause i'm super pumped about it even though it definitely gonna be super busy don't think i'm gonna get enough sleep at all this week but hopefully can get through it we'll see today was pretty good and was on time to my class um it was okay my regular teacher is gone and the replacement we have wasn't great but he wasn't terrible either so that was all right um and then after that ended up skipping my other lectures 'cause wasn't feeling too well and had laundry to do and [inaudible] stuff to do for um job that have and then made some plans um to get lunch later in the week with friend and talked to my sister about visiting her next weekend got some more information on plans for this weekend um which included making plans with another friend to visit and [inaudible] go out just depending on um how i'm feeling and how we both is over this weekend um and then have um just lot of stuff that due that worked on um which was pretty good and although am still little bit behind but feel bit little bit more confident about my respective class papers um and also found out that have quiz and test next week on the same day um but um feel little okay about the test the quiz is more iffy um need to do some more work on that but hopefully lab have this week will help me out in preparing for that but we'll see have one class tomorrow that i'm really worried about because it section that normally we just have [inaudible] for but this time we're having my actual professor uh um and generally don't like talking in section so really doubt that will talk tomorrow um but we'll see how it go maybe it'll be fine and he won't make me all talk just don't know what he gonna be like 'cause in lecturer he pretty um different than the other professor that i've had so hopefully it'll work out to be okay today wasn't feeling too well so missed both of my morning classes which wasn't great but talked to my professors so it should be okay and and um other than that did some homework but really just spent most of the day sitting around just because wasn't feeling well then did go to doctor appointment however it didn't actually tell me anything which was definitely frustrating but it should be okay because i'm going to see my chiropractor tomorrow so if anything else that should make me feel at least little bit better 'cause it usually does and then wednesday i've only got one classes but i've got plans with friend which will be nice and then have to go submit form for my summer [inaudible] that shouldn't take too long and then thursday and friday i'm super busy so hopefully [i can get] all my stuff done on time for thursday and for friday and then might have plans to go shopping with friend this weekend and have big event on saturday which i'm looking forward to but little bit nervous about today was all right [inaudible] really early i'm excited [for] an appointment this morning um so got up on time did [inaudible] right on time and even got to talk to my mom on the way which was super nice um 'cause haven't heard from her in while and then on the way back talked to her again turned in an paperworks that needed to be in before friday so that was really good and then um made it to class on time 'cause [inaudible] got coffee beforehand which was great since was tired um class really went well and then afterwards got to have lunch with my big from my sorority and that was super great since i'd only really have gotten to hung hang out with her one-on-one once before so that was super nice and feel like we really get along well and i'm super excited that we're gonna be spending the entire summer together basically um other than that went to work and got to have more time than usually do and on top of that already have more time than normal for this week due to training and other stuff so that gonna be really nice getting that paycheck next week especially because had to rebook my flight to visit my sister next weekend which cost little bit more than wanted it to but it worth it because she super excited and i'm excited i'm just gonna have to get through the class two days of class but am super busy 'cause i've got two pretty big assignments due friday and haven't had time to start either of her and i've got really full days tomorrow as well as starting with 900 am meeting with one of my mentors for the job that i'll be starting this spring um but it should go all right 'cause don't have any super specific questions that always seem to [inaudible] and get an general ideas about the stuff that need to have done so should be good 'cause we can um set date for my test and can start prepping for that after finish up with my stuff this weekend um and this weekend i'll also [inaudible] shop with friend which i'm looking forward to and then there concert on friday night that i'm gonna go to and have an event all days saturday that should be really fun and hopefully get an homework done during it because i've got two papers and two finals and test and quiz coming up so it should be pretty good today was all right wasn't feeling great [inaudible] but um was able to do all the stuff had to do met with my uh mentors this morning and then had the class all day uh which was okay [inaudible] great so i'm getting pretty frustrated with some of my class and i've got quite few things to do tomorrow [inaudible] didn't have to do tomorrow and it due by midnight so hopefully i'll finish it on time um and then other than that got some [time] with friends so that should be okay but don't know if it actually [inaudible] or not 'cause know she pretty busy so if she can't go i'll probably just go by myself um and [inaudible] with me which we will see how [inaudible] it [inaudible] just sucks that i'm not feeling well especially 'cause um have pretty big event on saturday and it gonna take all day long and kind of would rather just be sleeping especially in the [afternoon] i'm [not] getting enough sleep sometimes [inaudible] on uh stuff for my class so it pretty frustrating but hopefully i'll get over it soon because got plans next weekend too today was okay woke up really not feeling well but this time did actually make it to class on time and class was really small for some reason lot of people didn't come which kind of made me sad but got to work with someone that haven't worked with in while and like her quite bit so that was good and then had some appointment for coffee and it was just someone had never met before but we actually had really really great conversation really enjoyed talking to her and she gave me lot of good advice which made me feel better about how i'm doing um then we made plans for the future together which i'm looking forward to lot because think that could be really good friends with her um and hopefully that'll help me develop as better people in my own life um then spent the evening shopping which i've been wanting to do for while and intended to do in preparation for some exam tomorrow so i'm ready and hopefully the event tomorrow which is going to be long will be all right because i'm not really expecting it to be great but maybe it will be am sad though because my two good friends can't come to it and really wanted her to be able to but can just take some work and hopefully get that done get some emails sent and stuff prepared for next week and next weekend i'll be visiting my sister so i'm pretty excited about that today was all right had an event all day long that was little bit [inaudible] but not too bad went out of town and just spent lot of time talking on [inaudible] [inaudible] little sad because my two close friends couldn't make it so didn't have anyone that was super good friends with there so instead of staying to myself lot started talking to an of the other girls which was cool and then came back home did little bit of work sent an emails but i've just been feeling super sick and um down so didn't get too much done um then spent the evening with friends and we went to party and it was lot of fun and um just came back home to relax so tomorrow i'm gonna have to focus on doing quite bit of my homework since haven't done anything any today [inaudible] just my essays that i'm worried about my other classes should be all right and do have quiz on tuesday and two presentations coming up [inaudible] hope it will work out will be okay and then will be excited to see my sister next weekend today was all right slept in um lot because wasn't feeling too well lately um which ended up being really good 'cause then felt better during the day [inaudible] still super out of it and had quite bit of homework to do so got um bunch of it done but still ended up staying awake [inaudible] just 'cause i've got two projects this week and two papers which still haven't turned the abstract in for one and i'm super confused about where i'm going with the other so hopefully i'll have time to meet with my to have tomorrow to talk to him um 'cause [inaudible] regret that haven't turned it in yet well i'll turn it in tomorrow guess and just see how it goes i'm little worried about waking up on time and everything because i'm still feeling pretty sick but hopefully i'll make it and then on tuesday i've got quiz uh and [inaudible] which is really frustrating because need to study for both on top of pretty big assignment due too but this whole week is just gonna be pretty rough and then this weekend i'm going to california so hopefully won't be as sick then because i'm losing my voice and everything and i'll get to see my sister for the weekend which hopefully should be exciting and then i'll come back and have my last few day of classes before um finals and finals should goes all right although that two papers have to write is not gonna goes very well but as long as can just get on him end with in that classes then it should be okay we'll see though today was pretty good woke up on time to do my first class in the morning um my teacher checked in with me to make sure was doing okay which was nice but also frustrating um and after that took so little of time between class to work on something and then um had to ate some lunch and then had to go to my other class um so did it but didn't feel too well sort of was coughing lot and stuff like that which was frustrating but after class was good because met with my tf and talked to him about her project which was really awesome and then came home and got kind of stuck in cleaning mood so did that for while and then started doing homework but it frustrating 'cause the assignment tough and i've got quiz and test tomorrow that i'm definitely not ready for so have to study for the quiz right before class and hopefully i'll be okay on the test because i'm pretty good at what we're supposed to be doing so it shouldn't be too bad hopefully as long as can remember all of the rules have been should be able to finish that i'm looking to go to bed at least little early tomorrow night so it should be okay 'cause i've got work on wednesday as well so [inaudible] at 300 tonight [inaudible] only got forward little bit today was all right barely got any sleep last night so that was definitely struggle but still made it to class relatively on time um which that class is just frustrating me it why stayed up so late too and i've got another big assignment due thursday which sucks because that means have to do all of it tomorrow and on top of the project that have due friday and bunch of other stuff because also have an entire paper for that class due sunday so that class is really the only one that causing me whole bunch of trouble if didn't have it then would probably be doing just fine in all of my courses um so don't know about that it just kind of annoying um but you know it whatever and i'll just have to try and get it done because i'm going to visit my sister so guess can work on the airplane and hopefully have it done on time guess can just stay up if need to do it or can work on that on sunday however that sucks because wanna spend time with her but i've got really busy day thursday wednesday my only like relatively free day but got lot of homework and i've gotta go to work which makes it less [three] free and then thursday i've got formal that i'm going to with my friend that i'm super excited about but it is gonna take up all of my evening so won't really be able to do homework then which is why i've gotta try and finish all of it um tomorrow as well as this whole entire paper so that cool but did have test today and feel like it went relatively well i'm trying to be happy about it and had [inaudible] and [inaudible] an test but still think definitely passed at least which is nice so that yeah everything all right i'm just trying to get to bed soon because i'm all jittery from getting no sleep last night and didn't wanna nap today because it would mess up my sleep schedule more so as soon as finish watching film with my friend i'm gonna go to bed today was [hard for me] um my throat started getting really sore so lost my voice this morning and had group work which was super frustrating because then didn't get chance to actually contribute or help very much but that just how it happens sometimes and still feel like class was productive because understood what we was doing in the end and got jump start on my homework for friday which is good because i've got party tomorrow night that i'm going to with good friend um which will hopefully be fun i'm not sure depending on how many people end up going but there should be smores and stuff so it should be fun regardless and then talked to my sister today uh i'm visiting her this weekend and that was really great 'cause have better idea of what to pack and everything for thursday which was awesome um i'm feeling little frustrated 'cause skipped class earlier in the week for being tired and i'll probably do it again tomorrow um because guess have lot of stuff to do coming up that needs to be done before the weekend um because this is my last week of class so we're having all of my final projects and assignments so needs to try and get ahead tomorrow so might just have to skip that class again the lectures is videotaped so it shouldn't be too bad to catch up and know we'll be going over some of the [information] [inaudible] it should make it lot better but yeah um know [inaudible] to bed late again but that just how it is sometimes today was all right woke up really not feeling well and had to go to class um and we had [workshopping] thing so we did that and it was fun um got better feedback from my peers than expected um but then got feedback from my teacher [inaudible] later tonight um and it wasn't as good which is upsetting but went ahead and emailed him so that he can help me out and get the paper in the direction it needs to be going to because um it due sunday by midnight and tomorrow fly out to um stay with my sister for the weekend so have to really be on top of everything which sucks because i'm extremely busy so i'll probably be doing homework on the plane or in the airport or maybe just staying up and doing it and not sleeping when i'm over at her place but we'll see how it go um i'm pretty frustrated um just really needs this semester to be over with um i'm not sure um how it gonna end up but hopefully it'll end up okay don't know we'll see think i've done not as well as hoped but well enough in all the class so that should be all right today was all right made it back to campus it just took little bit of time to get from the airport to here and i'm super [inaudible] started way too late working on my um essay for [inaudible] and some other homework-ey stuff um so was super stressed and just turned my homework in and went home and passed out because was so exhausted um so feel little bit bad that didn't make it to class and know that my teacher is probably gonna ask me what [inaudible] [yesterday] but wasn't feeling well and definitely needed nap because happened to stay up and do homework late into the night uh which did and finished [inaudible] and then feel bit stressed [today] because the printer not working so have to try and get up early and have to go print some stuff tomorrow before class which hopefully i'll be able to do because tend to sleep in until the last possible minute so hopefully will be able to actually make myself get up at some time it was little bit harder than that in california because enjoyed my time there it was super nice and made some good friends um even though only met them for about day and i'll definitely miss my sister ton [inaudible] question why was at harvard just because feel that would be lot happier if wasn't here and [inaudible] and i'll probably need uh for my future but i'm going to talk to my counselor tomorrow so hopefully that will help with me figuring some stuff out today wasn't great woke up little bit late got to class late um [i finally] did some did some [inaudible] but um it wasn't really that productive um and then had another class and that was basically fine [inaudible] lecture because wasn't feeling too well [inaudible] back that did [inaudible] but it still wasn't [inaudible] and then um had one appointment with my therapist and just got really upset so ended up crying lot and stuff like that and just feel really isolated from everyone else coming back to california [inaudible] i'm in really bad mindset [inaudible] the semester don't don't really know what i'm gonna do about it because it putting me behind in my work and i've got quite few things to do coming up this week and next week yeah um and also there something that wrong with my tooth but don't have time to go to dentist or figure it out or have the financial means because right now can't even pay off my credit card um which is really stressful 'cause it never gotten this bad before um and think lot of it is just due to being in california um but yeah other than that i'm really happy uh and have lot to do to fix it today was the last day of classes it was okay mean it didn't go particularly great but it [inaudible] waste of time just have to get through finals and then start my job um still [inaudible] my [job] [inaudible] which hopefully will go well have test on friday and need to finish some stuff in preparation for it um it hopefully won't be too difficult we'll see um am looking forward to that job know it definitely gonna be hard to run crew um especially as i'm very introverted person and [inaudible] that it [inaudible] really isolated from person after having come back from california it don't know that am here and what [inaudible] doing [inaudible] i'm friends with the person i'm friends with uh nothing feels like it worth it anymore but just have to keep working and get through it because ultimately this isn't about me or my happiness it just about getting degree and being able to provide for my family and my mom lot of stuff just seems really pointless lately and really don't know what to do to make it better talked to my counselor but it really didn't help and she didn't have anything to tell me um but know just have to stick it out because i'm meeting up with some other friends later in the week and next week that feels communicate little bit better because actually like them get along with them even though i'm not particularly close to them um and yeah really don't know what to do didn't [inaudible] like [inaudible] other stuff so today was fine woke up on time to go met with my professor it was [inaudible] because he gave my feedback late so hadn't really had the time to [inaudible] before went but it turned out didn't need to worry because the [inaudible] went really well he was super nice and had good time chatting with him especially 'cause might not see him again that [inaudible] to the end of this semester and don't have class with him anymore it was really nice because he had told me how much fun it was to have me in class which appreciated because think definitely struggled little bit but [inaudible] time really had good time as well so i'm glad that he also appreciated my participation [inaudible] this semester then made plans to meet some people tomorrow for some other class especially the one where i've got some essay due next friday coming up um that the professor that have some comments on i'm not too sure about and then had to go over some test corrections for another class and had my dorm crew test which definitely didn't study enough for and i'm gonna have to finish my plans tomorrow but should have time to do that and lot of it is common sense it shouldn't be too difficult to remember how to do it in the moment so think it will be just fine and it will definitely be huge relief to have it over with and i'm just looking forward to actually starting clean up [inaudible] later in may um 'cause that gonna be lot of hard work but also really fun and [inaudible] might [inaudible] so that can get job as captain in the fall so i'm super excited about that and less excited about the test and [inaudible] that is coming up although the discussion had today made me feel lot better about my papers at least so that pretty good today was pretty good woke up and had meeting with my professor [i thought it went well] and was happy 'cause got [inaudible] done [inaudible] credit [inaudible] which is really good [inaudible] class is coming to close and then had meeting with another tf who was super helpful in giving me some advice about my final assignment so that made me feel lot better about writing that paper as well because he gave me some solid tips um and feedback on my work um and then had [inaudible] meeting which was definitely really nervous about [i think it] went better than thought because it was really just giving me advice rather than um evaluating me too harshly um which was really cool um [inaudible] and spent the evening um going out with friend to dinner and then watching films and hanging out um with some of my other friend which was super nice [inaudible] [inaudible] buy ticket now to one of my formals that thought was gonna be able to do for free but turns out waited too long to get the ticket so i'll end up having to buy it now which isn't cool um but that just how it is sometimes so i'll deal with that as well and then tomorrow i've got to go and do my [inaudible] since didn't do it earlier this week like normally do because was busy on my normal like designated day so gotta do two hours tomorrow and then i've got plans later with some people from my sorority so that'll be fun [inaudible] [slip in] little bit but didn't go to bed till super late last night so guess didn't really sleep in but it fine um woke up and oh first went to pick up package that finally arrived that i've been waiting [inaudible] month for um so that was fun and then immediately had to go to work which wasn't too bad it was just little bit annoying because set off like fire alarm and stuff which was frustrating but manageable and then finished work and hung out with some friends and did get little bit of studying stuff done gotta [return that] stuff to my teacher tomorrow um and i'm looking forward to tomorrow night because it my house formal so me and my [blockmates] and friends are all going um and it should be really good time although we've got presentation monday morning that are little bit worried about so we'll have to get that done but after that it pretty smooth sailing into friday and then have my first final and [inaudible] essay due which definitely need to have started which [inaudible] um and then finish that tuesday or wednesday and study for my final [inaudible] thursday-ish but [we'll] see how it go are definitely stressed about this final but feel like just need to study lot and hopefully i'll be able to focus and do just that because i'm sort of using this weekend to relax and party little bit so [inaudible] going forward hopefully can really focus for this final because wanna finish out the year like finish it well off um even though know probably are definitely not [going to get] probably not even single but that all right that just how it are sometimes and then i'll be able to start my job and start making money because i've been little bit worried about finances recently just had some extra expenses didn't think would have so hopefully that'll be okay today was really good slept in super late which was nice because generally i'm not able to do that and then cleaned up my room little bit did some work on the project that we've got tomorrow morning um and then spent the evening hanging out with friends we [inaudible] party for the house [inaudible] which was lot of fun went to my other friends [inaudible] we had great evening so ended up being super glad that went um even though was little iffy about it at first but ended up having really good time think it one of the best nights of this entire year actually which is super cool 'cause i'm glad got to spend it with friends and i'm just not [inaudible] home which isn't great [inaudible] type of presentation super early tomorrow but think [inaudible] and then hopefully after that i'll start working on some essay that i've got due because it due the same day as some exam that i've got so i'll need to do to study for that and do my essay um [inaudible] enough time because both of that things is happening on friday so hopefully can balance that with also having to complete my work hours this week and um tomorrow nights is really busy because of that another [day] [inaudible] going to with some friends and then before that have dinner that have to attend um so think tuesday wednesday thursday is gonna be more so my homework day but also normally work on wednesday so we'll see how that goes this morning was all right had presentation with my roommate that was really glad to be done with um 'cause it was math which do not particularly enjoy so even though it was little bit difficult 'cause we studied late last night and had to get up early this morning and then we practiced doing it pretty well and the teacher said that it was really good so that awesome um and then got to take nap which was really nice and we went to dinner with my sorority which was okay didn't stay very long though because had plans to talk to my mom on the phone because hadn't talked to her about week and then to get ready for freshman formal which was tonight so went to that and it was actually pretty good was really glad that got to see my friend [redacted] we made plans to hang out before entering the formal um so we did [inaudible] lot of fun and my other friend came over and hang out with us as well which is cool 'cause he super chill and spent the majority of the night at formal with him dancing um which was awesome and ran into quite few friend while was there so it wasn't as fun as the formal went to last night but it was still pretty solid was glad went we got some really cute pictures and that big plus um and then came back and my roommate had another friend over they're actually gonna watch show so [inaudible] with her for bit and probably gonna [inaudible] soon i'm glad 'cause don't actually have to wake up tomorrow which will be super nice 'cause can not set some alarm and sleep in although do need to start reading my essay tomorrow yeah and need to potentially go to work although might end up doing that wednesday or thursday or saturday we'll see 'cause i've got some stuff to do on friday so i'll figure out what day work best today was fine woke up super late because didn't have to get up for anything um and sleeping in was really nice then didn't find the motivation to do anything all day which wasn't great because i've got two major things friday and then something saturday sunday and tuesday so got quite few things coming up and [inaudible] still really need to go to work um so it definitely been struggle know tomorrow need to [do] basically my entire day to essay writing [do know it's] gonna be little difficult because do have to get up early for an appointment and then [inaudible] um [inaudible] and [inaudible] so hopefully i'm able to [be useful with] my time [inaudible] at least so that can get everything done that need to get done and [inaudible] starting with my exam 'cause that probably the one i'm worried the most about but hopefully i've retained information over the semester and i'm now going over old problems in my old notes restructuring them will be huge help in exam prep and i'm sure that there are an sample essay that could look at as well um so hopefully it won't go too poorly um and other than that i'm looking um looking forward to dinner i'm supposed to have because it with good friend haven't seen in while and we normally talk about an pretty serious stuff so that'll be nice today was all right got up early because got an appointment um yeah that had to walk to and so was outside for quite bit and since got up early actually went to get breakfast which was pretty nice and got to talk to my mom for while which was also fun um and then came home and took shower and then had to head to an lunch plans shortly after my academic advisor which went okay mean it was just little awkward [inaudible] [inaudible] really good [inaudible] people that don't normally talk to but it was okay and it was [free] food which was nice came home and did an work on my essay [inaudible] meeting with another friend which was fun because also had to meet one of her other friend that [inaudible] um so that was cool and came back and [talked to] my [inaudible] an more which has been going particularly well mean because i'm not feeling good which makes it really hard to focus and do my work but um it should be okay think i'll be able to get it done even if it not exactly to the standard that originally thought it was going to be [too] but it is fairly long and need to finish because i've got an exam the same day so really badly to study for so need to go get [inaudible] my essay and the other [inaudible] on my exam so hopefully tomorrow i'll [inaudible] little bit better and can effectively do that because know definitely need to and i'm frustrated because just got an email from professor to meet to-to-tomorrow to go over an stuff that didn't think was going to do so it pretty frustrating 'cause it very last-minute and really don't has time for it and it mean that may has to get up early again which is fine but also i'll probably be pretty tired since stayed up late working on my essay tonight but if just stay up and get my work done maybe i'll has time for nap or just get to bed at reasonable hour and study an for that same exam on the day of the exam because it not until the afternoon so i'll at least has the whole morning as well to study so hopefully it'll go okay because need to [inaudible] this essay out tomorrow today was all right ended up sleeping in because haven't been feeling well at all but um [inaudible] woke up and could barely sleep [inaudible] over coffee but [inaudible] had to [inaudible] so did that and did some problems [inaudible] so feel little [inaudible] next week [inaudible] continued and have been working on some essay since then which i'm almost halfway done with and is due tomorrow at midnight so that pretty intense have to go to bed soon because have [inaudible] tomorrow at 200 so need to have time to sleep and then can study for that tomorrow and finish my essay after it i'm super worried about the final but there not too much can do right now hopefully i'll do well enough to pass if not i'll just see what happens which just sucks because it [inaudible] all my final but i'll also get these two done tomorrow i'll be lot less stressed 'cause only have two left and both of which feel i'm well prepared for so that good today did not go well woke up feeling even sicker than did yesterday um and have an essay and final today um so that [inaudible] wasn't done because i'm pretty sure my final [inaudible] my essay [inaudible] differently [inaudible] [later] and [inaudible] every [inaudible] but it was just [inaudible] [for now] um i'm just hoping that feel better tomorrow 'cause have an assignment [inaudible] and then another essay on sunday and my last [exam] on tuesday so hopefully [inaudible] feel little bit better even scheduled doctor appointment for tomorrow um [inaudible] [through week] [inaudible] and i'm trying to take an medicine [inaudible] [good stuff] [inaudible] and see how it go i'm just [inaudible] since i'm [needing] lot of sleep 'cause can't breathe [inaudible] and even have [inaudible] headaches and can't think straight either but hopefully i'll get over it soon today was [inaudible] woke up feeling little bit better than had yesterday so that was good um and then finished some work stuff that was due and then [inaudible] on my paper that was due tomorrow although still have lot of progress [inaudible] just because i'm still [workshopping] few ideas need to fit into the paper but ultimately think it'll turn out all right um [inaudible] [inaudible] to go mostly i'm just concerned about how the moving is gonna go but do have lot of friends who should be able to help me and [inaudible] talking to my sister she might also be able to help me move depending on the dates and stuff it just frustrating 'cause it lot of work and it happening really quickly especially because move out and immediately start my new job um which is definitely gonna be pretty stressful i'm hoping everything go well because like i've pretty well prepared for it but we'll just have to see what happens in the end i'm just hoping that it'll ultimately be all right um other than that i'm just really ready for the summer to start 'cause have lot of plans with friends of mine and we're gonna hang out um as soon as finals is over as well if we have time so that'll be cool today was all right had to sleep in little bit and and then had to go to um club meeting which was okay just took longer than wanted it too especially [around the] stuff that had to go over um and went [inaudible] essay [inaudible] managed to finish on time and was probably the least um the worst one that [inaudible] last semester which sucks but that was mostly due to the length requirement so guess we'll just have to see how it go when get it back at least it done only have one more exam to worry about and that the one that i'm probably the least stressed about which is nice um and then once get that done i'll just focus on packing for my last two days before have to start my work at [redacted] which i'm really looking forward to although it definitely going to be lot but also it means i'll get paid lot so that fun and the only thing i'm really stressed about is [inaudible] what to do with my futon so might just sell it but we'll see today wasn't super productive study-wise did get lot of other stuff done and had meeting with my counselor this morning the last one of the semester of the year and she won't be coming back next year so i'll be getting someone new which is really interesting um and then had to meet with my math professor after that so guess that was [inaudible] but knew [inaudible] with them tomorrow and i'm studying for my exam before [inaudible] 'cause feel like that would be good use of time um and i'm honestly not too stressed about it think have pretty good grasp of this the material my teacher going to review few concepts and then in the afternoon spent the majority of my day packing and getting stuff ready to move preparing for my two summer jobs and stuff like that so feel like that was pretty good use of time as well um [inaudible] maybe should've been studying but will definitely focus on that tomorrow so it should be all right just really have to make sure to stay on top of everything in this last few day because start my jobs on friday and i've got really busy wednesday [inaudible] tomorrow and [inaudible] busy thursday i'm just really hoping that can sell my futon before then because otherwise i've no idea what i'm gonna do with it and don't want to donate it 'cause that waste of money so we'll see what happens today was pretty good [inaudible] little bit of [inaudible] night sleeping last night mainly because was still sick but still managed to wake up on time and do some studying before the exam that had today at 200 um which was my last one in this semester so it kinda crazy to [inaudible] freshman year to finish but on the bright side um i'll be starting my job on saturday um so i'm really looking forward to that 'cause i'm [inaudible] but also [inaudible] lot of fun and i'm still trying to [inaudible] figure out with the futons [inaudible] i'll [inaudible] get that ready for friday [inaudible] [set] i've talked to some friends about [inaudible] stuff [sorted out] [inaudible] so that i'll feel better um [inaudible] um i'm not sure what [inaudible] that have um [inaudible] still have to figure out housing stuff because haven't heard back from dorm crew or the summer proctor people yet but hopefully that'll get figured out soon 'cause it'll be nice to know i'm going to [inaudible] especially 'cause have quite few things to to take to multiple different locations since i'm staying to proctor the whole summer as well so i'm needing to know what gonna be happening today was fine i've been on kinda [inaudible] now that school over and i'm getting ready to move into my [jobs] but should all be all right and hopefully [i'll] just need to still figure out this thing with my futon and having little dilemma with the packing but nothing super major it just gonna be frustrating to move stuff multiple times because can't really lift thing um but uh should be all right in the end just have to stay on top of everything i'm little bit worried about my dorm crew job which had really not thought much of until now um so that tough because don't wanna be worried about it just wanted to [inaudible] [really well and] [inaudible] but know that probably not realistic just really hope that end up making captain um and other than that just don't know i'm not huge fan of saying goodbyes um [inaudible] 'cause i'm just not as emotional [inaudible] i'm ready [ready] for that to be over with 'cause know my roommate gonna be super emotional and i'm not really gonna have reaction but that just how am so but it'll it'll be done with soon enough so will have the room for few days which will be interesting [inaudible] today went pretty well woke up on time and um had to go and move all my stuff into storage and helped my friends do theirs which was fun and then my roommate left which is actually really nice um because she quite difficult to deal with but she did of course leave huge mess behind so spent the majority of the day um after finishing storage cleaning that up and then [inaudible] to do [inaudible] training to relax for little while um so tomorrow i've got to meet with my some of my working people um to get plan because i'm gonna be restarting work on saturday um [inaudible] go for the next five weeks which should be interesting but it know it gonna be difficult but i'm also still looking forward to it i'm only really worried about getting some stuff moved into temporary storage and because my sister yesterday said that she gonna come on sunday um to pick up my futon which is the last day that she can get it so that is pretty frustrating because she has to get here on time or we won't be able to get it so hopefully she do though we'll just see how that go today was pretty good got to sleep in for bit and then went to meet up with my fellow workers uh 'cause work starts tomorrow and we was talking about um stuff for my uh assignments that starts next week which was nice because we definitely needed to get that stuff so that we was all aware of the plan what we was doing stuff like that uh so it was really nice to go over that um and then we um after that came back to my room got [inaudible] and then helped friend move which was nice because we had never really got to spend lot of time together um in the [inaudible] so it fun to sort of just hang out with him alone and even if we was just moving stuff to someplace so really enjoyed doing that and then hung out with another friend for bit which is [inaudible] the other room and then there more people that um my friend is friend with but hadn't really talked to him once and so it was also cool to get to kind of know him little bit better and it seem really chill so think we'll hang out with him more um and then had meeting this evening got to feel even more motivation such as where i'll be moving next and who i'm gonna be working with starting monday um so it was really awesome because now i'm really looking forward to it and can't believe that work starts tomorrow and that pretty exciting and know probably stayed up little bit too late 'cause of nerves and stuff but think i'll still get enough sleep and i'll definitely try to get to bed early tomorrow um 'cause i've got work sunday and my sister coming down on sunday for bit at least which would be pretty cool so hopefully everything go okay today was good had my first day of work it kinda went well although it was really tiring and definitely didn't get enough sleep last night 'cause was waiting up for friend um and was trying to go to bed early tonight but have lot of packing to do rearranging so all of my stuff will actually fit um so i'm probably going to be exhausted tomorrow and am definitely not going to bed early tomorrow night either it sucks but it is what it is um and you know it won't end up being too bad so just [inaudible] and do my best am little bit worried 'cause need to wake up semi-early in the morning um so that can uh go over some stuff and move all of my crap into [inaudible] also on the upside if don't get everything moved can try and do it during my lunch break as well because don't have to be out of my dorm on time and my sister and her boyfriend will be here so it can most likely help me as well which will be nice also i'm not sure how much help they'll actually be 'cause they're really just coming to pick up my futon and then going um and that probably going to take quite while on [itself] so but i'm hoping it'll surely be okay and um so yeah am definitely worried but am looking forward to work tomorrow think it'll go well even though i'm stressed about it um and i'm sad to be [inaudible] on my first rental but got really nice new housing so although have ton of junk to move um it should still be really nice because it really nice housing [inaudible] again so that fine and maybe [inaudible] will help me move my stuff as well today was really good although extremely tiring had to wake up early and move all of my stuff into temporary storage and then went to work um it was whole lot of stairs so i'm [inaudible] really sore and was having to carry lot of stuff so i've got lot of bruises so it pretty painful but it also really satisfying work although was frustrated because the room i'm staying in was total mess so had to deal with that and um really didn't have time to clean it on top of everything else but that just what happened so um i'll just have to deal with it and looking forward to tomorrow 'cause i'll be meeting my crew and everything and really starting work so hopefully it'll go super well we-we'll see in the end um but think it'll be good i'm really excited so yeah today was pretty good it was my first day of work so got to meet my whole crew and made few mistakes but ultimately it ended up fine and got quite bit done i'm looking forward to tomorrow and i'm really glad that have the mentor and captain that have because he really on top of everything and helps me out lot i'm little bit worried 'cause my legs are really sore so walking tomorrow are gonna be challenge especially 'cause had to try and run back to the yard at one point and it hurt lot um i'm going to bed little earlier than did last night because i've got meeting at 700 are again [like will have] this whole week so i'm gonna try and actually get some sleep so can start feeling better and be really on top of it tomorrow um and make sure that my group get stuff done in timely manner so yeah that basically all that happening i'm kind of upset because someone [drugged] my mom and she just have not been available at all so i'll try and talk to her tomorrow instead guess today was all right had my second day of work and my crew fine um i'm just not very motivated still and ran into quite few problems especially with [inaudible] supplies and cleaning few things lot of stuff had to be redone which was frustrating um but think we're handling it pretty well and have plan for tomorrow hopefully if can wake up early enough i'm gonna pick them up donuts and stuff um other than that i'm just really hoping that my whole assignment gets finished by the deadline know i'm worried but do have one more worker showing up tomorrow so hopefully she'll be good as well and then we'll have four good people and two mediocre and two not great people um so yeah i'll definitely just have to see how it goes and it gonna be pretty rough 'cause i've got [inaudible] people tomorrow for competitive jobs next week but was really glad 'cause this evening got to talk to my mom and she gave me some advice and stuff and think i'll talk to my mentor tomorrow morning to gets his opinion on something um but yeah um other than that mean it work i'm doing it for reason because really wanna be part of this so hopefully everything will be finished correctly and on time today was pretty good and had work done but um got up early this morning to get my workers donuts and think that definitely motivated them and have some pretty great plans that we both set up for tomorrow so hopefully we'll get through all of them um and that really just matter of finishing up and everyone been saying that i've been in good shape and i'll even have another walk-through tomorrow night with someone that trust so that should go well because feel like she'll give me really good and honest feedback um and i've got assignment up the next week which i'm pretty excited about don't know we'll see how it go um and i've been trying to go to bed little bit earlier but end up [inaudible] for while because all my muscles are also sore but feel like all this really necessary thing to do um which are fine 'cause i'm still going to bed much earlier than did last night so think i'll still feel pretty good tomorrow when get up and maybe i'll even have enough time to grab coffee tomorrow um we'll just have to see 'cause did little bit of last prep as in basically getting my stuff together than normally do but think it'll still be just fine so overall let hope everything happening everything going okay and can't wait for saturday once i'm done with all the stress and can just relax and probably sleep in mean there small chance we'd get work but most likely we won't have to and that'll be nice um 'cause this week have definitely been exhausting today was okay i'm definitely feeling burnt out now that it um only been week that i've been working lot plus hit overtime yesterday so feel extra exhausted um but it good kind of tired in that know that i've been really productive and feel like i'm doing really good job so i'm nervous about tomorrow 'cause it the last day but i'm also really looking forward to it um my crew has really shaped up nicely um i'm kinda sad 'cause two of them will be separating but think it will still end up being just fine um because my assignment is going super well so far um am basically just has to get inspected which it should be done by my mentor so hopefully it will go really well um i'm not exactly certain but i'm pretty sure because he been checking up on stuff throughout the week so know it hasn't been too bad i'm gonna be sad not to see some of my crew members again after this but who know maybe will we'll just we'll has to see today went pretty well it was my last day with work for this week um with my crew and so it was pretty good but um it was super exhausting because worked for over 14 hours um which is definitely lot i'm glad that hit overtime because i'm getting paid really well but at the same time definitely need sleep um thought could sleep in tomorrow but then it turns out have an early morning meeting for work next week so won't be able to um but maybe can take nap later in the day or something also have to clean my room and help friend move stuff so still have lot going on but it should end up being fine um even though am getting to bed lot later than i'd hoped today was pretty good um didn't really get to sleep in like wanted because had meeting early in the morning but it was still fine because came home and was able to nap after that um and then helped friend move her stuff and ended up going to party that had been thinking about going to but wasn't sure if was in the mood but was only there for about 30 minutes and then left um with the intention of just eating and going to bed but i'm really not feeling well um so it been difficult to really go to bed um 'cause i'm having some issues feel really nauseous which is also not great because have work early tomorrow morning too um so i'm gonna have to get up early and um get ready and everything get [done on time] but hopefully it'll be okay and hopefully i'll feel better tomorrow i'm not sure what to do um but hopefully it'll just go away on it own today was pretty good started my [june] job um and woke up on time for it although was almost late because it was longer walk than initially thought but it still went all right um we spent all day basically loading unloading in science [inaudible] which was okay but it was kind of difficult um 'cause [inaudible] and did spend the last week [inaudible] um mm-hmm had to clean the whole house um but other than that when the alum started coming it was fun because just got to chill with them and take their luggage and i'm hoping that the whole week will still be fun um think that potentially i'll be doing this job for while um and they're and really like the people i'm doing it with so that awesome other than that my friend is moving in with me after friday so she had to bring much of them stuff into my room tonight which was fine but was also trying to get to bed so it little bit frustrating but overall still okay um think them living with me for bit will definitely be interesting 'cause will just have to see how it goes in the end today was pretty good had work again and woke up feeling rather tired but still managed to make it just on time and it was actually um the first [work] week here so that was pretty cool um then had good day [i helped] quite few people got to meet quite few people [inaudible] interesting and i'm glad 'cause think my boss really likes me um which make me happy because [inaudible] now that i'm doing good job she trusts me and appreciates my work so that pretty nice to know um other than that i've [inaudible] for the rest of the week and then next week start another job um but think this week will be nice at the rate it currently going um just because i've got um quite few things to do but relatively low key um so can definitely get that done um and not be too stressed about it although [do need to] [inaudible] because was so tired this morning and [inaudible] today [inaudible] um [inaudible] [to and meet] tomorrow but don't wanna be too late because that means i'd have to stay later which is fine but not ideal 'cause do have some other responsibilities that need to get done [inaudible] tonight um other than that had phone call from my sister who normally don't hear from which was interesting and had to give her some advice but think overall it went okay so that pretty good too today was all right overall uh um [did] wake up early in the morning kinda sick to my stomach which was frustrating because had to work um so went in little bit later 'cause already had approval from my supervisor anyway um which was nice because definitely needed the extra sleep after getting sick um and then when did go in felt better and we had relatively slow day so so got to spend some time relaxing which definitely helped um and then the evening got little bit busy but in fun way um [they're] really enjoy working with the people and that makes when you know you're helping um so that was nice and got to spend time with some uh [inaudible] my class and people that knew from my job last week so that was cool as well um because i'm trying to get closer to them so it obviously lot and we have lot of um activities and stuff in common other than that didn't really get chance to talk to my family too much today but still did little bit mostly with my mom which was nice because always enjoy hearing from them and how things are going it was also cool because um got my or know how much i'm gonna get on my paycheck and it like made lot but taxes that are taken out are definitely lot but it still gonna be plenty which definitely need because need to pay my credit card coming up in uh just little over week so i'm really glad to know that i'll definitely be able to do that as well as get few other things that i've been wanting so that super exciting um and hopefully i'll get to go out with friend soon think work tomorrow will be pretty easy thursday might be stressful and then i'm not sure how friday saturday and sunday will go so we'll have to see but hopefully have time to go um relax and do some things apart from work and definitely need to try and makes some time for laundry tomorrow so i'm going to go into work little bit later than normal but not too much so that can get off at semi-early time and do my laundry and everything so that should be nice we had work again today which was mostly all right although wasn't feeling well and had to deal with pretty frustrating person but it was understandable um because the person had just been having really difficult week although it was still frustrating [inaudible] [something] had to deal with it um especially because one of the other workers wasn't really doing anything so it could have been helping but overall i'm still feeling okay around the whole the thing especially 'cause know my manager really likes me and know that work hard i'm just sort of run down and tired and i've got an early shift tomorrow which i'm gonna try and make it to on time but also had to do laundry tonight and i'm just so exhausted that i'm probably gonna leave it in and grab it in the morning which means that i'll have to try and wake up slightly earlier so have time to go down and get it and everything um but that basically it and i'm looking forward to having break this weekend and may be going shopping 'cause need new phone case and an other stuff so that should be fun today was good day had work again but it went pretty well even though woke up feeling little bit sick um but almost done now and the only major frustration is that we had little bit of controversy over how we is gonna get paid and stuff like that but think it will work out fine in the end um although it might not be the exact outcome that we hoped for but something at least is being done um being fixed so that pretty good um other than that i'm pretty excited for my [job] next week and [inaudible] couple other people who [inaudible] is gonna be here so that pretty chilled as i'm good friends with them as well um and then we can become better friends as we all work together next week 'cause there gonna be very limited number of people who is actually staying here um so i'm really looking forward to that and i'm gonna have couple of people staying with me um starting tomorrow so moving them in is gonna cause little bit of difficulty but nothing too major um so it should be all right once it just finished um and i'm little sad that haven't seen my family 'cause [talked] [inaudible] today which makes me miss them even more but hopefully will get chance to at least go home for little bit sometime and see them depending on how much money makes over these last few week of work um and even if [just get] to see them for like five day think it will still be really cool because just haven't seen them in forever so we'll have to see how that turns out and hopefully it'll be good 
6YG55,so today been pretty good day um definitely an improvement from last night with lots of friend drama and guy drama which i'm totally not used to because went to an all-girls school for so long but um mean things seem okay definitely resolidified my friend groups um practicing putting myself first which is definitely something new um trying to understand how college works 'cause kinda just live it out on limb um and you know you're gonna drown if you don't keep up and so need to look at courses because if don't get into with lottery courses then i'm kind of screwed 'cause only have three classes so that kind of stressful but it know have faith but also feel like need to get on that um but did get lots of works done definitely didn't think could study with my friend but apparently can and felt really productive today studied for math and my econ homework just doing well and moving forward all this is very new to me so i'm just like getting used to it and stuff but it seem like pretty good day all right today was [desfrinitely] an interesting day it started out awesome and then didn't get into my class i'm super stressed now ate good food but don't know what to do with my life there no guidance kinda stuck on limb yeah there nothing else really going on i'm just super stressed super super stressed today got much better than yesterday ended up getting into my lottery class which was awesome made me feel like things worked out and the universe wasn't forgetting about me um sat in my econ class didn't enjoy any of them um so that was unfortunate um and now i'm really nervous sort of about fail even like econ if i'm still thinking about money and not what gonna make me happy in life and that definitely drives me crazy um but you know did homework with my friends today i'm feeling like i'm with the same people all the time which love um but feel like it could be bad for me later on in life and that not gonna be good but i'm hoping to make more connections have so much to do in so little time and i'm just wondering if this is actually doable and if this teachers is expecting me to do everything or if it supposed to just be like we give you all of this you know do what you want to do from it don't know and this is really frustrating and stressful and guess college is the beginning of being an adult but there just no guidance there it like huge gap between high school and college and don't know how to handle it so that is really really positive just kidding it not um but yeah witness one of my friends having breakdown today i'm surprised didn't have one as well 'cause just really didn't enjoy my class and that was what was looking forward to but i'm hoping things get better it just the beginning saw my dad today that was good um yeah also had this things where don't feel homesick at all um and an people do definitely come across that but just don't feel it um feel like there nothing to miss and like where am like the people that i'm with and i'm wondering if that also bad things and if i'm pushing my feeling away because i'm so busy or don't know but yeah today was definitely an interesting day spent more time by myself than think have my whole time here um it definitely got lonely it was definitely little bit scary um made me feel pretty isolated didn't love that um but think it something that definitely need to get comfortable with but mean got lot of work done today which is good um took test today was studying for it all day but think uh it paid off which is good i'd been studying yesterday too so it wasn't all cramming but definitely did get nervous last minute and decide to really just do that but got all my homework done for today which is good um let see yeah had really good interaction with my friend today you know told her how lonely got and stuff um and how was nervous that would be that person in the group that we had just sort of left because it put me through lot of emotional stress and didn't wanna be burden on anybody um but yeah she was really supportive really helpful you know reminding me that that not who am i'm very different person um i'm also nervous about classes don't love everything that i'm doing but it is the first week so it could just be don't know just not great but i'm hoping things get better um and i'm still grappling with this idea of do wanna be happy or do wanna secure job or can do both or you know but um yeah that definitely something that been hanging over my head um and is really scary actually um and it not something that can ask anybody for help for which is also nerve-wracking because i'm so indecisive and don't do anything by myself but here to adulting pretty good day today got lot of work done i've been to [redacted] initiation which was cool um yeah had some time by myself had some time with friends today felt kinda weird it was like lot of stuff to do in little time but got lot of work done and was able to work ahead of time which is important but [inaudible] practicing that is really hard but yeah not bad not bad today had pretty okay day today um didn't get as much work done as i'd wanted to still trying to figure out how to do what work when um but yeah had an interview today also don't know how that went for consulting but we'll see i'm just coming back from the library now it 145 and was 10 o'clock girl three weeks ago here am coming home at o'clock in the morning from the library but oh well i'm liking the readings i'm learning [inaudible] yeah interesting day today it was nice doing homework today because was productive yesterday and today so things feel little bit better um got most of one application done still have another one to do it kind of like i'm drowning but like my face is like right at the surface so had air but like you know um you know one wind could really just kill me and i'm kinda nervous and feel like i'm like uh floating but i'm really nervous about econ i'm nervous about you know being on top of things and doing things right and like applying to too much yet not enough and i'm really just trying to figure out this whole experience also coming from an all-girl school social stuff is kind of nuts like guys is things apparently and like don't know just don't know how to take social cues and that very damaging so that something that stresses me out but yeah it happening today was pretty good day um don't know you could say like worked with different people definitely worked by myself today and was productive finished applications am super worried about extracurriculars there just so much to do but the comping process makes it like once you get denied there nothing left and that really scary um but yeah i'm hoping everything goes well just have to sort of have faith guess 'cause at this point have no idea what to do um homework is going okay not amazingly um this is never-ending cycle but it okay um yeah i'd give today like not great but not terrible today was an awful day um [and ain't] the first day that have come in um don't know just come to terms with my actuals emotions how i'm feeling how i'm not doing well feel like don't belong here like i'm not good enough getting rejected from everything and find myself being jealous that my friends got into programs that didn't and i'm so proud of them but at the same time i'm wondering what wrong with me what am missing you know why don't have drive why why am always left out and it super super frustrating because don't know what wrong with me and if did know would change it and just like want to know but feel like things happen for reason and i've always believed that but at this point feel like can't anymore because there no way that i'm supposed to go through this much turmoil this much stress this mus much like self-degradation every single day it just hard to come to terms with my reality when it sucks so much um and did that today and it hurt me lot didn't even trust myself to go to the bridge and just relax because didn't know what would do that really stressful to think about um and don't know if i've been low like that before 'cause block things out in order to forget them but i'm just like super stressed and feel like i'm not supposed to be here and that this place wasn't meant for me which it wasn't but don't know what to do with myself think really might go into really deep depression here and it gonna be an awful experience today was pretty great day got initiated for the [redacted] that was awesome um yeah hadn't felt like young again you know was dancing with friends went to party um danced guessed whatever they call they here um but also like went to class and got some work done and had some okay meal um but uh guess something that stands out to me today was my connections with people not only did get to meet great people in the [redacted] initiation and like having found my big siblings and things like that but also got to connect with friends um that like met outside of abhwa that was guys actually and guess they're pretty normal which is interesting um they just like i'm able to open up to them where opened up to one people today and just saying that like you know don't mean to come across as like trying to avoid people or or upset or or just like distant they just don't want to do the wrong things because of where i've come from but which is going to some all-girls school for eight years like just wanna make sure that i'm doing you know th-the right things and not overstepping anything or making people feel uncomfortable because i'd never wanna do that especially because know what they feel like um so that was actually really nice really really grateful and like i'm sort of excited about these relationships to see where they go and stuff um but yeah also feeling like definitely not good enough still um my friends is all better than me and i'm so proud of them but at the same time i'm wondering what did wrong and if belong here but you know things is happening but yeah had pretty great day today had lunch with my dad hung out with some friends made some new friends and really meaningful connections which i'm really happy about am feeling okay with my extracurricular commitments and i'm just gonna be happy with who am and gonna do this homework one step at time it is not gonna be easy and that okay but i'm i'm gonna do what can as can and as much as can yeah i'm i'm actually really happy with today today was was pretty awesome so i'm very very happy made better friends with the guys and basically it have my back and they're not like intimate or anything but just wanna be my friends which is great and it just like don't know maybe have different outlook had some really good discussions with people and it just felt normal like almost forgot that it weren't girls which was cool but yeah i'm i'm happy i'm pretty happy today pretty okay day today um had lot of work to do got some of it done um starting to [inaudible] in the morning had new experiences um let me think yeah got to see [redacted] today which was awesome she been gone for two day which was really long time feel like we've gotten so close like just like my friend [inaudible] this past couple of weeks that um small amount of time feel like lot and that definitely really interesting how it like this is the new world this is like my group of people now that i'm with basically 247 and actually like like it and feel excited about it and feel like i'm actually have [inaudible] [constant] which is different from home um but it really noticeable and things is different which is little bit scary but yeah interesting day today um lot of things went wrong um basically feeling super incompetent about everything that do i'm not really happy with myself or proud of myself or the programs that i've gotten into uh just one which is really exciting um just kidding it not um yeah my friends were definitely there to support me though and they're definitely having well one of them at least is having similar issues with just feeling like they're not their best self not really good enough for this place and things like that um definitely cried today just couldn't keep it in just feel like i'm not enough not good enough will never be and it hard to be to suck really um and so my mom is giving my cat away which is great you know just icing on the cake um yeah to cope with my emotions ordered some insomnia cookies my friends got me ice cream 'cause were crying outside over like everything yeah basically it just really suck to suck and when people say it it just seems like joke but it very painful process and almost feel depressed like am very unhappy with myself and don't like myself right now so yeah thought things are getting better um that was like getting my homework done started to get back on top of things then got my [ec grade] back today for my first [inaudible] and got 792 and feel like crap um and think everybody else are doing really really well and and getting these great grades and here are can't even get anything good on my [ec] things and it like don't understand what i'm doing wrong still like i'm trying so hard i'm putting in effort and it like it not enough and don't understand why i'm here if can't succeed um it just really bothers me and today like had moment where couldn't even take it like went to the river and sat and stared at the water because i'm so disappointed in myself all the time um yeah basically hate myself and academically think i'm trash socially i'm trash uh and want to stay positive when think of been known as like bubbly person um in my friend group but like lately don't know can't even like stay positive about these things because every day it like something new that just tearing me down and like don't wanna talk to my parents about it because don't want them to worry think i'm not doing well and then think i'm gonna fail like it always do but like don't know where to go and like can't do it anymore and feel like i've been able to deal with stress and like not doing well but these are another level where can't even look at myself right now and like like really hate myself and i'm so disappointed in everything that do my peers are doing so great and wonder what i'm missing um so i'm just trying to get around that today i'm doing really bad don't wanna kill myself but like there nothing that makes me wanna stay anymore so i'm just like really tired and now just go to sleep so don't have to feel any emotions it just everything are going wrong my mom want to give my cat away can't get good grades can't makes the right decisions socially academically i'm not doing well can't stand out and when do i'm wrong and it like why are econ so like not even hard just like not made for me and don't know i'm i'm really really really really stressed pretty interesting day today um didn't really have too much stress from my friend group barely saw them um but definitely had some stress with my parents and them dealing with me not being there and my cat et cetera um but yeah today was kind of weird day didn't love the day actually really like um like being with my friend so that was unfortunate but got like some work done and did okay i'm going to bed at some almost reasonable time so that good but i'm just really really tired haven't been getting enough sleep i'm like not aggravated with my parents but just um coming to terms with the fact that now they need to know that didn't have happy childhood but don't wanna break their hearts um 'cause know they worked hard but yeah just that types of stress pretty good day today um got some great work done met with the study group went to some great office hours and actually understood stuff which is really exciting so i'm definitely gonna try to switch group um just kinda felt accomplished today like did something and got it done and feel confident about what it like um didn't see my friends as much today but when did see them at the end it was really great it was like reward which is awesome um yeah mean it was definitely different type of day like was definitely alone lot like just doing homework and stuff but got all the work done that needed to get done which was huge have nothing to do tomorrow that due tomorrow so i'm happy with that i'm very very happy pretty good day today [coming] [inaudible] my phones didn't do as much work as wanted to um but was able to be there socially for somebody else for multiple people and think that really important so i'm kind of okay with that um yeah mean it was pretty casual day was definitely more relaxed than usual and didn't have lot of social interactions until after my classes i'm feeling in pain like i'm literary sick um and like my intestines hurt but don't have time to go to health services so that won't be happening soon um yeah yeah i'm just trying to balance school work with social life 'cause do need to [inaudible] my time pretty good day um until the football game which was awesome got to see my friends from home which was great um definitely had new social experience today where don't know if i'm attracted to people or like if i'm attracted to specific people but like the fact that my roommate kind of like came in and kind of meddled with something that had or was working towards maybe unintentionally did not appreciate that whatsoever um this one was getting around that you know didn't really feel protective of that people until this happened um so yeah don't know how to quantify this experience or feeling or like anything um but yeah that definitely stressed me out bit um discovered new friends through that or like better friends should say um so out of the social tension or like academic stress like think can deal with but the social stress is something very new um definitely dealing with body image issues right now just staring into the mirror um feel [inaudible] which is exciting just kidding it not um but yeah really love my friends hoping we stay great friends 'cause really trust them yeah pretty good day today um relieved some stresses that was feeling before did little bit of self-care today and got things that needed or just wanted like my phone and um some makeup that i'm going to learn how to use uh also um good connections with my friends um both guys and girls um yeah definitely making progress again and building confidence think and and being okay with you know things that are supposed to be the way they are um when they comes to like getting into things and programs and stuff so i'm gonna do the one programs that got into and i'm gonna do my best at they i'm gonna do my very best and i'm gonna be great in they um and that how i'm gonna improve myself um so i've been like thinking about they lot and you know just telling myself to apply for everything now because nothing really given so they something have to deal with but definitely working on they and making steps to get better improve myself and just not put too much emphasis on like social stresses and just really get my schoolwork done um yeah um today was pretty interesting day went to reading class by myself instead of with my two friends um they didn't end up going this morning but felt fine actually sometimes feel freer to express myself academically when i'm not around friends um so which is kind of weird um other than that definitely did get to see them did program at the iop today where basically sat and listened to lady talk and people asked questions um something else uh socially um guess just this guy like don't know what they wants because don't know anything um but nah they wants to like hang out um and don't know what that means and i've been supported really well by my friends um and they've just been sort of helping me understand how feel trying to figure out how they feel and just get around that so that definitely been something that been sitting on the back of my mind other things that have been sitting on the back of my mind is exams and midterms that is coming up um but they all just feel like blur in the near future which is also not good um and need to plan that out and that like stressing me just little bit um but yeah that is most of my social stressful interactions pretty interesting day um had lot of work to do still have work to do not done super super unfortunate feeling um struggling with the econ still but things are getting better just have like so much work to do and so little time and it not even like wasn't productive today like was and i'm not getting enough sleep and i'm getting sick so it like there nobody you can go to because everybody says college are so hard and stuff and like it think we know what we're walking into and we don't and just like feel like super unprepared but also like it not doable can't do everything and it kind of sad and little scary um didn't really see lot of my friends day was doing lot of my homework and would've hoped that if had spent day like that it would've at least paid off and it didn't so that was unfortunate um yeah tough day today had super super super heavy load of homework still needed to do things today that didn't get to um i'm really really struggling with econ feel completely unprepared um think this may be one of the worst decisions i've ever made and even with tutor now i'm going in on my second meeting tomorrow can't do the set by myself failed the actual unit review things today and the lady let me pass 'cause could talk through it guess but like i'm just so unprepared and then there like no help and i'm drowning and that really stressing me out the fact that i'm walking home at 230 and i'm not even home yet just like this is really awful um but yeah that really where all my stress is lying right now can't really think about anything else some like guy problems is like they're miniscule really compared to my academics at this point um but yeah am so stressed so stressed rocky day today lots of emotions felt like couldn't do econ but got it done best work maybe not got math done um let me see just had some interesting interactions with friends um guys new but feel like i'm making really good connection that i'm really proud of and happy with yeah and i'm really tired and need to go to bed and should've gone to bed but didn't so here am all right yeah pretty okay day today feeling really sick um socialized with different group of people today that found stimulated me bit more um which really appreciate and it makes me kind of rethink what i'm doing who i'm being friends with and how i'm allocating my time among that group um i'm also stressed about mid-terms didn't study as much as i'd hoped to today but yeah need to get cracking so i'm organizing everything in the process but yeah i'm just really asking god for help right now 'cause i'm so so so nervous but yeah another interesting day um spent time with my mom um which was good she has been expressing lot of feelings about me not spending enough time with her pushing her away or whatever so worked on that today and and some parts of my mind was like you really need to study you really need to do work but other parts of me was like this is really important and you really need to work on this relationship as well and i'm really struggling with balancing school work and and social life and social life is lot but i'm i'm trying and i'm really nervous for this midterms and keep thinking about the studying that has to do and don't quite know how to do it but i'm asking god for help because at this point really don't even know what to do and feel like after this first ones i'll be prepared and like i'll know and went to the bureau of study counsel so i'm ahead of the game for the next time 'cause don't like feelings this way um yeah went to party tonight and came back at reasonable time but was talking with the same guy again till late at night don't know what that means feel like don't even want to admit it to myself so yeah but means pretty positive day socially would say pretty chill day just did lot of homework saw my parents for quick second and they dropped off some things but wanna get to bed early i'm so tired and i'm sick and need to care for myself also need to study even i'm putting my homework first today because they important um upcoming events that are on my mind are my math midterm which are tuesday my ec midterm which are wednesday um avoided some people today 'cause just wanted to focus um so like stayed with my usual comfort group but didn't branch out bit like usually do to my other phone group um and yeah i'm definitely struggling with things people wanting to be with me hanging out with me and don't wanna be there 'cause feel like have important things to do but then i'll turn around and go with different friend group so don't really know but yeah pretty i'd say they was pretty laid-back day actually um pretty big day today or or tomorrow guess have my math exam tomorrow i'm studying for feeling okay about um lot of new social things arising person i've been hanging out with expressed that he like me today it wasn't really in the way that had expected it was more of surprise so something that i've heard from everybody else except him um so yeah while was doing my work it just sort of like came up again and then he like took me outside and then spoke for little bit and i'm little disappointed um and don't even know why don't know how to read these situations but like guess wanted there to be something and and wanted to move forward but the fact that i'm not the reason why it wasn't happening um is unfortunate think for me in my opinion and so little bit sad about that and don't know why i'm sad like basically it just like he very interested in me or whatever but like he he wants to make sure of what back at home and just like if he gonna have relationship or not um yeah and and and don't feel like like i'm not enough or anything but guess it was just disappointing really don't know how to feel so here am struggling as usual as usual pretty uh lonely day today didn't feel lonely but realized later that was alone for lot of the day um just di-did lot of studying uh got lo lot of work done um but yeah tried to focus on my work today was getting distracted lot about the situation with this guy but it don't know what gonna happen and have faith that things will work out the way god wants them to but right now just really wanna do well in my mid-terms and don't know how feel about the math and don't feel amazing um but did definitely know things which was great um but yeah it just makes me more excited for the next ones in terms of like actually being prepared and like getting my life together and planning ahead or whatever 'cause definitely didn't do that and it backfiring just bit so yeah and i'm just ready to restart and it hasn't even ended yet so it little bit nerve-racking but hopeful pretty okay day today um spent most of my time by myself um did really well in my classes today think which was awesome only had one classes today but we had section as well as lecture and think did pretty well um yeah felt productive by myself but was happy no but then got around my one of my friends' and my dorm whatever you wanna call it house and started to feel like disappointed in myself like i'm not doing enough still which is really unfortunate um but yeah so thought hanging around my friend would make me happier but it made me feel little bit less efficient which was surprising because i'm always happy for people when it do great things and stuff so it was streak of jealousy that didn't like yet here it was um but yeah did some homework by myself today and with friend i'm gonna start doing homework by myself little bit more just 'cause think need to get comfortable with being with myself 'cause haven't been by myself in while so yeah just very [inaudible] day for where i'm comfortable pretty interesting day today worked lot on my essay that wished started earlier when finally felt was making progress went to office hours and basically had to restart so started worrying on have to go to bed 'cause i'm going home tomorrow and making an early trip and really need to get an sleep um but i'm nervous about this paper i'm super nervous about it and worked on it basically all day but yeah i'm just really stressed about that sometimes kind of the only thing could think about unfortunately uh are there social interactions was pretty much alone today um an of my guy friends came over by surprise tonight felt it was interesting um interesting occurrences with that people but really do like them and enjoy their presence so it was fine um and saw my girlfriends today my normal group my home basically um yeah so saw like most people today just not as much as usually do and did like all my homework by myself so that was new was it as productive mean occasionally i'm really focusing on the paper guess but yeah it was difficult to grasp well was really just struggling with that work crying and felt the usual but yeah really wild day still working on this paper that is due at 10 o'clock tomorrow thinking i'm just gonna wake up in the morning not allow myself to do anything no fun no friends no food till finish this essay 'cause i'm really over it don't wanna do it anymore it all i've been thinking about haven't done any other homework should've been getting ahead this weekend but i'm not really frustrated with myself 'cause feel like can't limit myself when it comes to certain people and that really really hard but yeah basically my life sucks and i'm terrible at self-control in social situations um today spent most of my time by myself um finishing an essay that was due at 10 o'clock tonight finished it at like 300 um but then had to like cut out words and like put in the the formatting and citations in um but yeah so like it was kind of productive but at the same time wish had done it and started it earlier really don't like finishing things on the day it due um so today is gonna be well today was lesson guess tomorrow is gonna be productive don't um like having to cram work um so tomorrow i'm gonna do just lot so don't have to do that um other things didn't get to see all of my friends today so ended up [inaudible] didn't get to see him today but um yeah also i've noticed um my friends uh she told us that she was depressed little while ago um and feel like know little bit about that just because of where i've come from um and that like you have good day and you have bad day and and things like that and think i've dabbled in depression actually quite bit but don't really know how to help her and like she don't want help but want her to be happy you know um and know what bothering her and it her boyfriend who just like is not being great person um but guess it like not in my range of authority and can't really tell her how to do these things because i've never done it but just like feel terrible and wanna you know she really close friends and care about her so that been something that i've been thinking about but yeah that just been in the back of my mind sitting um today spent most of my time by myself doing my homework went to bed pretty early last night so woke up little bit early but got 11 hours or almost 11 hours of sleep which is great um so felt really good really needed that worked on homework for one class all day today it was that much um it was over 70 pages of reading and other articles and had to write stuff about it um which is atypical but i'm sure why it quite took me so long um today but um now that i'm done with my midterms am try well not really have more coming up um but really wanna get ahead so i'm going to try to get ahead within these two day um and just get ahead in econ and math wanna study wanna do really really well on these next test because didn't do on the last one um and i'm just really determined i'm trying to remember who am so um just read card birthday card from my friend from home and it says something along the lines of can't way to see the things you do you're incredible um i'm just trying to remember who that is and find my drive um and think with some of my friend do find that and with other don't um but yeah upcoming events that have been on my mind is really just future exams now i'm just really trying to get ahead of schedule that my goal um 'cause don't like doing things last minute or the day before they're due um yeah today was also with my friend while she was talking to her boyfriend things aren't going well and that was really interesting to see because don't really know how normal relationships work um thanks to what my parents had so yeah that was pretty much my day mostly by myself felt productive but just as productive when was with my friend so we'll see um pretty interesting day spent lot of my time by myself again um just doing homework reading studying trying to get ahead did little bit um not as much as i'd like to but definitely made progress um yeah just trying to prepare for my next mid-term which is on 19th um so have some time but really really wanna get cracking on it 'cause need to do all that wanna do uh um so i'm just really trying to focus on school now and and get ahead um that basically my biggest priority let me see what else yeah saw lot of my friends today had one-on-one with the ones that usually don't um but it was fun and you know just seeing my friends do well in school get good things i'm like obviously good grades do come to me but guess don't like broadcast them but it feels like it just come to other students at much higher rate than it do for me so that been something that been kind of knocking at my academic confident but um i'm trying to get around that i'm really trying to work on that but yeah another interesting day today um had definitely had some time to do some homework right by myself which did also ended up doing little bit of homework with my friends um let see um other than that mostly heavy with classes today today had the most classes um that felt really good that did some work on my um tea set and things started to come together which has never happened before in econ so that really positive um let see some things that are on my mind are my ma my math exam which are thursday that i'm trying to study for earlier but every time tell myself i'm gonna study for it has like no time so it really unfortunate um yeah just seeing how my friends react differently to stress one friends barely react at all she has midterm tomorrow didn't really know and my other friends had midterm today and you could definitely see how stressed she was about it for while um yeah i'm just trying to really get ahead of the game and do really well other things um went to my guy friends house tonight or like dorm whatever you wanna call it um and basically just had like normal conversation at first but then bit more conversation about like what going on with us guess and like how he not really ready for relationship which was interesting don't feel mad or sad or happy about it i'm just sort of there seems like it would be my reality as soon as feel like i'd be willing to possibly you know if somebody else are not so yeah just really interesting us trying to grapple with that and understand if even want relationship if i'm ready for it don't know how that gonna go with school so yeah pretty interesting day today um had type of social interaction that was more academic-based than like what it usually is where it just like me struggling with my friends or having really good time with my friends um instead we had some really interesting discussions about race and identity within uh education in my class and spoke up about that and there was like couple of problematic things so spoke to lot of students about it especially the tf spoke up in lecture um so that was huge um other things sat with different group of people today um at lunch and definitely don't fit into that group but think it really interesting and really enjoyed being there because they're so comfortable with theirselves and they're so free-going and confident and wanna encapsulate that and find that confidence within myself um yeah did lot of work today catching up or really staying little bit behind but yeah it getting better today was really good interesting day um interesting day today failed my econ midterm um so that was interesting um had really good heart to heart with group of my friends today all of us really just talked about how we was struggling with what and learned more about my friends um but also like got deeper understanding of my own emotions and figured out how lost was and and these tears was falling from my eyes but didn't know what they was coming from um so then had another heart to heart with my friends um and they gave us some really good insights as well and i've just lost hope um and i've lost myself here so i've been trying to find that um upcoming things on my mind are my next midterm homework getting on top of my game just doing really well and also just keeping faith and understanding these process and taking things for what they are but also not just being complacent and failure um yeah these are sort of new day for us and and new lifestyle these are gonna be the beginning yeah pretty low-key day today got little bit of work done went shopping um went to party tonight got somewhat closer to male friend but think like kinda destroyed it unintentionally of course um as usual so don't know what i'm doing um but yeah was having good day now i'm pretty um know i'm gonna be distraught for like the next uh at least day and half so just gonna get over that um let see social interactions events that are upcoming events and studying need to study for my math midterm keep saying i'm gonna do the practice exam and don't um so that really annoying um yeah the party today was really interesting and i'm still out with this guy loved it it felt great it felt right but of course had screwed it up and was screwing up school so really really really really really need to do well so i'm gonna focus on that and just let things happen because cannot live with this recurring sadness of failure just washing over me all day every day just need to do something right and at this point the only things that feel like could potentially do right are something academically so that what i'm gonna work towards but um yeah definitely pretty emotional right now um pretty interesting day today uh got like good amount of work done even though thought wasn't being very productive ended up really turning that around um caught up with econ did my [math] piece at friday night so yeah mean maybe it wasn't very productive today because only did econ but did read multiple chapters and take notes so yeah uh uh um definitely looking over social struggles that i'm having with specific people and like relationships and relationships building and and feel like at this point am just going to take the relationships that have now that know am great and then valuing lot um i'm gonna keep that ones as it am and then for other ones i'm just gonna put my schoolwork first know it happen if it happen if it don't it don't um yeah i'm definitely struggling socially but i'm really pushing it to the side because don't care and don't want to care um but yeah so that definitely happening but other than that went to brunch today and that was really when saw my friends and then at dinner saw them again but most of my time it was by myself yeah not bad had an okay day today did most of my work by myself it was pretty productive learning that don't know how to study so that was exciting um had breakfast with my friends today had dinner with my friends lunch with different group of people um definitely feeling an type of way about certain individuals now really just don't want to hang out with them don't want to be around them um and that definitely new because i've been trying to be very positive about everything but i'm really over it um let see no really spent most of my time by myself today it was super busy kind of really structured day with just like one thing to go to after the other but really liked it and it made me feel um kind of like how it used to be where had structure so had to do my work and it made me be lot more productive and really appreciated that so yeah pretty okay day today um pretty busy going back to this thing with heavy schedule lots of thing to do um it was pretty productive at night it bit of later night than i'd hoped um but i'm still getting to bed didn't spend lots of time with friends today until later tonight and it was only one person so definitely saw less person but just coping with stress and putting structure back into my life um with like making sure go to thing while at the same time you know trying to fit in social thing and then studying and not pushing person away or cutting ties um other than that yeah just really focused on lots of my academic thing today and left it at that and it didn't feel bad wasn't super super happy but did like the structure so yeah um what else no literally just did school today and that was it but didn't have to do any homework last minute today and that felt really really good um had an okay day today it wasn't very productive on top of that lost elections for [redacted] um took math practice the exam today did pretty well told myself that that wouldn't be the last thing do and nor would take it as reflection of why i'm studying even though it went well because should review still and it was different material 'cause it was different test um and yet didn't went to bed quite later than hoped um and don't feel stressed like feel like emotionally hurt like inside but don't really know how to like don't know release it spoke to my friend today over facetime and cried to her because i'm not good enough for this place um and that i'm inadequate for everything that do and everything thought knew about myself i've failed that here so um that definitely struggle um yeah today like it was just busy day academically and at the same time still feel like i'm stagnant in my work but yeah also my friend was talking to her boyfriend over facetime and he seemed really great and amazing and was like wow wish had that you know um then realized that well after she hung up she was like think he gonna cheat on me or like whatever and it was so different from how the phone call seemed and that was fear that remember from my childhood and it made me nervous guess but like also while they're on facetime like was talking to her boyfriend friend and like we're really hitting it off or whatever and it just like they're so much around me lot of it that can't take advantage of simply because i'm not good enough but um there are so many risks as well though and that little bit scary to me but essentially today was another bad day where all of my thought are justified and that i'm not good enough for anything here and are not who thought was um pretty okay day today did some cram reading uh this morning unfortunately and but i'm glad did it it was really helpful for the class um then studied for my or uh like reviewed for my midterm little bit and took it and feel really good and loved that feeling of doing it and after doing it where it like okay i've seen this before can do this i'm confident and it and i've been progressing like for more than one day before so that was something that really gave me uh um peace of mind and so that something that i'm gonna try to practice now um also um let see um was let in on some struggles that my friends are having some my guy friends are having with girls guess that was eye-opening in that like there are lot of people with different plans for life and lifestyles here and like abstinence and things like that and think lot of people are breaking under this pressure and that they're not sure who it are or that it can even stay [through] the morals that they've created here because there so much going on and sometimes you're so deep in things that you can't really see where you're going and um that effect think has tremendous um amount of weight on your shoulders um especially when it has to do with things like religion and like really sexual tendencies and um yeah this whole like love life romantic things it like it gets me little bit sad sometimes that don't has anybody um but also like know people are out there and it gonna be tough and but do need to has that experience so it just really interesting the things that has been on my mind rea like academics are really important but at the same time used to feel like i'm missing something that i'd love to has so we'll see interesting day i'm really tired ready to go to bed um yeah just like didn't do as much work as hoped to today had some interesting conversations with my friends um regarding other friends that have and you know whether that friends should be friendship should be like stronger relationships in the future and like romantic relationships and how dangerous that may be for me um so like appreciate my friends looking out for me of course um and think some time they're like that dose of reality that need but also like really wanna feel wanted and think do feel lonely but like i'm surrounded by friends but want to be wanted romantically so that something that i'm grappling with um uh yeah just need to be little bit more productive tomorrow lot more productive actually so i'm going to go to bed pretty okay day today was not as productive as i'd hoped struggling with math set we had total new topic that have never learned and it quite difficult um had lot of experience today with males went out with my males friend and his males friend who is interested in me um thankfully was able to bring one of my friend along 'cause didn't feel like was gonna be okay by myself so that was really great um something else that happened today yeah just like really wanted to do my work and spend lot of time on organizing how was gonna do my work um but then didn't actually do lot of it um until got back home um but like feel better now that it like pretty much organized and done and can just go and do things and like trust that it the right time to do it and stuff um but yeah i'm just like really not feeling good and think not sleeping is catching up to me and i'm like shaking right now so yeah um spent most of the day by myself today just doing work um working my calendar trying to figure out what work to do and realizing that definitely still need help with this process of organizing all the work that do and moving it back and it feels helpful little bit but i'm also definitely stressed about it um so i'm trying to get around that but did some work that due tuesday today so that was great um which isn't that far out but it feels farther out also definitely sick quite sick actually and think need to go to health services um have pretty bad cough ne used my inhaler today which am not as mad at getting worse so that definitely problem um other things that did today went to the gym uh really spent most of my time by myself but was doing homework and found that lot of the work that had to do it was me like giving myself incentives to do my work so i'd like give myself like treat or whatever after doing certain amount of work um which is terrible 'cause don't know if that means have drive or don't have drive um but other than that um it really just me today mostly and then had like dinner with all of my friends and did like tiny bit of homework with re with them but yeah um spent most of the day by myself today attempting to do work um i'm pretty sick went to the health center today but [inaudible] 'cause felt like had lot of work to do 'cause went to get my flu shot but then you shouldn't get your flu shot while you're sick so decided against that um but yeah basically spent lot of time doing the same piece of homework today and so like was happy because had finished the work that was due tomorrow li-like at really good time like seven something but still have lot of other work to do and i'm still struggling with econ and like i'm like getting better think but i'm definitely still behind or like not where i'd like to be so that something that i'm struggling with other than that just like went to dinner with my friends and then did homework in the women center and that was probably the most productive think we've ever been which was awesome but yeah i'm just really sick and need to get more sleep pretty lonely day today spent most of my time on the homework grind just doing work um going to study hours to realize that study hours are not there um but yeah i'm like getting ahead of my work but i'm still not as ahead as i'd like to be like really wanna be studying for econ but feel like there no time to and now that have like my schedule organized and stuff still don't think there time which are little bit nerve-racking um it actually quite nerve-racking but yeah today was was lonely like got good amount of work done was happy uh not quite and so that definitely something that i'm struggling with um yeah but other than that did end up seeing one friend today oh no couple of friend today um but you know it definitely things are changing and not like badly or positively it just that like with school life like balancing schoolwork and social life it really hard when you're always surrounded by your friend so that something i'm struggling with but yeah um today spent most of the time by myself um knowing that had an event tonight that was from 800 to 1000 that was socializing made sure to do all my homework that was due tomorrow yesterday um and get an work done today that due tuesday although didn't do lot of the work that due friday i'm still really uh struggling with econ and feel like just stare at the problems and don't know what to do with them mean i've been slowly moving through but definitely not at pace that'll get me done by myself by noon on friday or by 1100 on friday um so that the [inaudible] math is getting hard really fast everything just changing um but yeah really spent most of the time by myself feeling like i'm not having enough time to do my work and now not only is it family weekend my friends wanna hang out um my family wants to hang out at the same time and like don't even know what going on i'm just going day by day which is mo like scary and don't like it because there so much happening all the time um so definitely have this stress around me that just like go go go go go even when you're ahead of the game you're behind studied really hard for my math exam um got it back today and only got an 87 was like is you kidding me so out of 66 points so like the points small loss in points makes bigger impact on the grade but thought i'd get an at least but that okay um yeah just like going along this thing that we had tonight was um couple of like black students got together seniors brought an freshmen together and it was good group of boys and girls just you know hanging out and chilling and kinda liked it was like kickback so we just sat there there was alcohol there didn't drink any but like someone gave me sip of their like wine or something but that was it really didn't wants that um but didn't feel pressured either which was really awesome um sat there and drank my juice and it was great um but yeah no that was definitely met lot of new kids today don't really know or like five or six kids guess um and yeah that about it um so the day is basically done saw none of my close friends today um except for one that saw during um econ review for [p-set] we have due tomorrow and that was pretty short-lived as well um i'm feeling really terrible definitely miss my friends today um but like i'm quite sick my body not healing itself um my skin is turning to trash um feel really fat pretty sure i'm getting my period but like nothing happening 'cause i'm irregular but nobody believes me and my symptoms for my period is pretty bad and know they're gonna get bad and think should be on birth control but don't even know what resources to go to get that here um yeah basically my health is just like really bothering me right now and like my workload i'm not happy with it either so yeah today was very different day and didn't feel happy at one point but did speak to both my parents today um saw my cousin from [redacted] had dinner with her and my dad we spoke little bit it was like little bit awkward but not really um that just kind of how we is but yeah just don't even know how to feel about today yeah couldn't even be productive because had so much stuff to do but now i'm done with all my work i'm just gonna take shower and go to bed but yeah um pretty okay day today saw my parents um we hung out for bit and realized that miss them little bit wasn't sure if it i'd like guess miss the idea of having parents and like not that it like do things for me but other people were like i'm with my family or like met my friend little brother today and he were like such cute people to know you know it such great connection and were like yeah guess do miss my family miss being around them but like wouldn't want to be in the same place that were before either way so like it just like weird things to think about because don't really get homesick and it not really homesickness that i'm feeling it more of this like like you guys don't talk to you guys lot um other things is went out tonight wasn't as productive as i'd liked to be today um got an econ tutor most amazing people so good i'm so excited and uh went out tonight realizing that like do like this guys and like even though don't think he is quite like perfect for me like want someone in my life and want them to be that people because trust them but wonder if if want them to be that people 'cause he the only people that know but like you know so definitely struggling with that but it is what it is um today was stressful was not super fun but mean it was okay it parents' weekend so was just with my family lot and was reminded basically how glad am to be here not living with my family um but just mentally straining day i'm just like mentally exhausted emotionally exhausted and didn't go out tonight 'cause just didn't think i'd be able to have good time in the state that i'm in and didn't wanna spread that to anybody else um but [redacted] my friend called me after to make sure was okay and stuff and that was great um also hung out lot with male friend my parents met that male friend vice versa as in his parents met me it really liked each other or no it really like me my parents really like him but you know here we am not making moves with each other he not moving forward um that struggling that something i'm struggling with just wish he would do something forward um yeah that something that just been on the back burner for while got no work done today at all so that was awesome just just completely awesome but yeah feel super prepared for the week do feel confident with myself was basically fat-shamed all day so uh my parents want me to go the gym every day my mum have sent me meal plan uh no sweets just water um so yeah don't know what i'm gonna do but will be at the gym tomorrow morning so exciting um pretty interesting day today to-today was the last day of parents weekend think don't know my parents was here they had this you know big talk with me about um that i'm not quite being my best self here and should get more involved in opportunities and just remember who am and not to get lost in this things and not to just uh be part of organizations that am all black need to make white friends also need to exercise and just like lot of things and like think kind of needed they little bit um so like i'm not mad at them or anything but didn't knew they needed to happen but really wasn't ready for they to happen but um yeah mean that was just me basically [inaudible] to get my [inaudible] and they was just like stop hanging out with your friends so much and [inaudible] get involved email your buddy blah blah blah so mean i'm really grateful in the end and when i'm going to be new person things may be little bit different in terms of how much i'm hanging out with my friends who i'm hanging out with um for the next bit but know that also need to um do this for myself and start defining self-care as putting myself first academically and and in every other endeavor and not just physically which is also not going very well because can't really take care of myself physically because i'm breaking out overweight whatever they is what they is but yeah so new outlook on life for tomorrow um pretty good day today felt really good after working out the day felt longer felt like had more time um don't love how late i'm going to bed right now because will be waking up early in the morning um saw less friends today almost none really um but got some work done um not as far ahead as uh that i'd like to be but definitely got some work done and am hoping that this process you know gets better and feels more comfortable and things um but so far i'm really liking it and connecting to people to gets involved in my extracurricular [inaudible] and had like pretty good conversation with my male friends um and it was just like that was like my guess my study break if you wanna call it that um and think it went little over time but did like it and liked reading with him so it ended up being okay but other than that it was pretty normal day didn't really see much of my friends and wonder if this is gonna be the new norm hmm yeah don't know if that good things or bad things right now so that something i'm struggling with but other than that not much um today was pretty interesting didn't really hang out with any of my friends today um did see my dad and after class um went with him guess he was just checking in on me making sure things was going okay that i'm getting involved in things and it was nice it wasn't bad at all um yeah feel like i'm really getting things done which is really good feeling um and think it coming little bit at the cost of hanging out with my friends and don't i'm not upset about it or sad about it yet think um but i'm hoping that can find that balance but as of right now really just need to settle down and focus so i'm not really spending my time thinking about what could be doing without my friends because know what want and need to be doing um so mean think that like more of good things than bad things but um other things mean so talked to some of my friends today who really close with me who met here and was just like hope you're alive hope you're okay whatever miss you um and think she being alone lot more now and think that bothering her and she somebody who not really great by herself um and think earlier was willing to help her by being with her but at the cost of me doing well which is troublesome but miss her and love hanging out with her so think have to find that balance as well but yeah it just like really interesting feeling where i'm like i'm alone but i'm also meeting new people and like sat with somebody who haven't spoken with in while because she didn't really get along with friends group that had been hanging out with and it was just like it was cool it was relaxed him and another people as well yeah think i'm broadening my friends group and i'm not leaving the other ones behind i'm just spreading out guess so this is new and right now as of right now i'm not hating it so think that good um today felt okay again i'm spending more time by myself don't really know how feel about it so i'm just like really really tired and being dedicated to the gym i'm still not getting as much sleep as had hoped um but yeah am like i've seen couple of my friends today and like very quickly see most members but like don't know it just don't feel the same and don't want things to fall apart 'cause really really love having them around love being their friends and love how feel when i'm around them but i'm afraid that things am going to fall apart just 'cause we're not spending that much time together anymore and it really it sad am sad about it um because miss them lot but it not like it don't live like mean it it all live like 30 seconds from me but it just don't know i'm afraid that things will change and i'm sad without them i'm probably little bit more productive without them but didn't think that would have to fall off entirely but think like what i'm going through think everybody else is as well where like they're also not spending that much time with other people so it just like don't know it just me getting around that and i'm just little bit saddened by it but other than that really spend most of my time by myself doing homework no yeah that about it and eating i'm really trying to pay attention to how eat um yeah definitely feel like maybe have been overeating in the past couple weeks so i'm trying to do like portion control figure out what i'm going to eat before get into the dining hall because i'm really trying to lose weight now because i've gained the freshman 15 so need to lose that asap also my skin is terrible um feel better now that i'm working out and like feel less stressed but i'm tired and don't see my skin improving don't even know if i'm healthy or not haven't had my period in over month and half so yeah just don't know what going on at all with my body and usually when there something wrong with me and like through my body that usually tells me that there something that i'm trying to cope with mentally but usually don't like push feelings away so much don't really feel things but it come about through my body which mean that i'll have to figure out what is bothering me um which is going to be really really hard so yeah um today was an interesting day saw an of my friends earlier this morning an new friends an um normal ones guess my normal group um but yeah i'm just doing work today felt pretty good with econ like sat down and did it and found that really could do an um which was really really great thing to see um like could do the work by myself basically and that made me feel good um going to the gym keep looking at the scale waiting for me to lose weight kind of hard um so i'm struggling little bit i'm yeah basically just really missed my friends spoke to ones of them today and was just like i'm just like scared you know i'm like scared that we're not gonna be friends and that like thing are gonna fall apart was like really love the people that i've built relationships with and like she like reassured me that that wouldn't happen but mean how much can we really say isn't gonna happen so and think that was something that was bothering me unconsciously but yeah i'm just trying to like get around this this hump getting involved in thing there just so much to do all the time i'm sore i'm tired i'm waking up have to go to bed early wake up early but like like it like the length of the day like the way wake up you know there more structure and appreciate it but yeah that just my day um social thing really not much have happened spending lot more time by myself now pretty good day today um got some work done for econ started my math [pisa] um but also spent some time with my dad spent some time with my friend and spoke to her about my dilemma that was having with just like not just not seeing her but like while we was walking back and she was like going back to her dorm i'm not really sure where we was going um she was like okay are you gonna head home now or and was like well she said where are we going and was like i'm going to [can today] she was like okay i'll see you later and was like you're not coming with she was like didn't know if you wanted me to and like that made me really frustrated and it was the first time think felt like mad and it wasn't wasn't mad at her was just mad at like the situation and you know it was just like the culmination of like this are exactly what like not only what was afraid of but what think thought [wasn't] gonna happen with her and also her relationship with her boyfriend and like she has no idea how much people want to be around her and i'm such some hypocrite but like it just it really really bothered me and like at first just like started like running up and down stairs and just like being like no it fine i'm fine like just needed like walked away from her multiple time and then eventually she like grabbed hold of me and was like just need you to tell me and was just like don't understand why you're pushing people away or like it wasn't that it was that like know she not trying to push people away but like how does she has no idea how great she are and how much people wanna be around her and ended up crying for her and was just like saddened by it because she has no idea and she so dependent on her boyfriend view of her that she has no idea what happening and she also [chaining] herself for this guy who don't even text to say how are you doing and so that was something that really like shook me today that was like my fresh air of emotion and then also hung out with some other friend for little bit in different social group and basically told her my life story of like my parents and like family structure family struggles of course and it was just like it was fine but usually when talk about that things i'm like really okay and it like don't bother me but like today could not shake it off after spoke about it and that something that don't usually happen so like was just don't know what and so like after hanging out with her after told her just couldn't be happy couldn't dance around or with her and then it just like felt like don't know and this guy are like still somebody that wanna be with and has relationship with but like it made me wonder if i'm enough if i'm like even confident enough to be with him and will ever be comfortable enough to be with him 'cause i'm so different like we don't don't just like dance you know what mean don't don't does that things and that his norm so yeah that are my social struggles today but it getting better feel good i've made amends so it all right pretty interesting day today um didn't get as mu actually no ended up getting the work done that wanted to um studied little bit made me feel little bit more inconfident though um went to play with um male friend the same one as usual and uh it was really interesting it was about like these kids who are in very conservative religious school and setting um and their parents didn't really tell them about sex or anything so when it came about it um it was just like it was very interesting it was really basically about how like not telling the truth hurts you in the end but um there was some um don't know the it had little bit to do with like domestic violence and like sexual abuse and i'm like usually fine with that from my past but like these time guess like and didn't even notice um but he told me after he said that like while that scene was happening like was shaking my leg he can tell that like was kinda like breathing faster or whatever and like i've just never noticed that so that was very interesting but like also he noticed that but he didn't do anything about it he said like he thought he was gonna put their hand on my leg but then he was like but know you're not on that wave essentially meaning that i'm not interested in them which are completely false and he know that but um yeah also saw another male friend today that think should be more interested in than are i'm just really struggling with balancing social life and like feel like it all coming at me but also have lot to do and like don't know how to have time for these things yet like really want relationship for some unknown reason um but yeah things are like changing really just wanna get do really well in these econ exam that what i'm hoping to do uh yeah must just just must but yeah that about it pretty interesting day today was very relaxed but still got stuff done which was good pretty interesting day today um got some homework done did some studying feeling like it paid off little bit i'm understanding things um hung out with my mom today went shopping to get clothes for conference have next weekend let see yeah it was just like wasn't as productive but like it was at the same time also went to some event today um called the road to success and listened to these three speakers and it was just really really awesome to to be there and felt sort of re-inspired which think is really exciting um but yeah am just spent most of my time with my mom didn't see many of my friends today saw one friends and we went to the event together then we got food together then we departed and realized don't really know how to say goodbye to people without it being awkward so that new um yeah it pretty mediocre day but like good mediocre day pretty um okay day today did lot of studying for econ still feeling little bit ill-prepared but less ill-prepared than before and am yeah today was like pretty busy saw couple of my friends today and hung out with some new friends and yeah hmm really didn't do much today other than work went back to the gym this morning it was hard i'm getting heart pains like used to again um feel like i'm stressed about something but i'm not quite sure what it is got this like anxious feeling usually when get my heart spells that because i'm stressed so i've gotta figure that out um but yeah i'm just really tired really wanna get to bed um but also i've so much work to do and feel uh like there really not enough time to do it um which is really scary have like mini-paper thing due wednesday have some econ exam due wednesday have emails to send [inaudible] it just so much um basically just feel extremely overwhelmed but yeah um today was super busy day um just really had lot to do thing after thing after thing did lot of work got my work done um which is good don't really feel prepared for econ tomorrow so have to wake up early and study for that for sure um and don't think i'll ever feel like incredibly prepared but um it i've gotta do that it gonna happen but yeah i'm kinda nervous about it but at the same time like feel like there is thing that know you know and when went and did um like office hours with my tf like was able to say some thing which is very rare so like there is definitely improvement um but i'm so really nervous about it and really wanna do well and met with the personal trainer today so i'm gonna be doing that [i assume] once week my goal is to lose 15 pounds and don't know yeah just getting [fit] guess prepare for lacrosse maybe um other thing yeah i'm just like really tired my body hurts uh and really really want to do well on this econ exam so i'm really gonna try my best but yeah that really all i'm really thinking about um yesterday somebody called me square which essentially is somebody that not very interesting and is boring and today when saw that same person and was like happy energetic my usual self it called me polygon which guess was compliment but like i'm not boring person but if seem boring is 'cause you don't know me so that something that definitely stuck with me today um but yeah also had really good interaction with that person today and like just like different person than normal but yeah i'm just kinda doing my own thing currently don't know how feel about it but it happening so yeah um pretty not stressful day today but interesting day today spent most of my day studying for my econ exam which was also today um and had studied for it earlier but just wanted to get more in 'cause really really wanted to do well um paid off bit there was definitely some things knew definitely some things didn't know um but that okay like figured out my mistakes along the way and just tried to keep going and did as much as could lot of people struggled with it which think was okay um but yeah so now i'm just currently being sexiled from my room but really wanna go to bed 'cause have to wake up and go to the gym tomorrow 'cause didn't go this morning 'cause really wanted to study and went to bed late as well um tomorrow no excuses but um yeah i'm just like really tired um hang out little bit today with my big sibling in the association of black women of harvard um with two of my other friends and kinda felt like my big sib was lot closer with the friends that consider myself very close to and like it was fine and everything but don't know it just didn't give me great feeling felt like was kind of useless um and pointless which was yeah like said was saddening but not really things can do about it um other than that yeah mean really just spent lot of my day studying today didn't get to see my male friends that usually see every day um and yeah so that was unfortunate as well but i'm also yesterday somebody approached me and gave me their number so that was new and think they're really attractive and they're pretty nice people during my math class so he pretty cool guy um yeah yeah that basically what going on in my life trying not to pick at my face but that currently what happening um which is bad 'cause my skin was doing great and shall continue to do so if stop touching it but it addictive but other than that things have been like really like slow today [i didn't love it] don't feel very good about my body today either so something else [inaudible] want to eat 'cause knew hadn't worked out which is kind of even more [inaudible] think but yeah pretty busy day today barely did any work um quite problematic have thing due sunday i'm really struggling with it it more creative than anything else so have to write um poem by spoken word and i'm struggling with the poem hard thing about that you can't really rush art so i'm kind of in jiffy currently [inaudible] stress about it too much i'm just really tired struggling with male friends um the one guy that i've been like hanging out with lot kind of like him or whatever don't know guess he just like an entire paradox and he reminds me way too much of my father for me to like him yet do and don't want to fall into the same position that my mother fell in so this is me trying to um just stop that by not like falling off or like cutting him off of my list but just keeping it platonic [inaudible] platonic just need to keep him as friends and just friends and cut off that interest 'cause today when found out that he could possibly be talking to another girl just got really upset and like not even upset guess was sad and like didn't know why and then realized why was sad and it wasn't because he was with another girl it was more that he was lying to me this whole time and saying that he wasn't ready for relationship yet or yada yada but here am hearing from other people that he pursuing this girl or this girl pursuing him and he letting her do that so just like this is the first time something like this have ever happened to me and it makes me feel little bit like i'm not enough but know that completely false so like what am worried about um but do really wish had significant other like seriously it just really i'm forced to be lonely all the time which is crazy to think about because i've never had relationship so why am missing something that i've never had but who know what going on with my life right now um today was eventful um sort of just like continuation of last night um and we had conversation me and this guy was really hopeful but just feel really bad feel like did something wrong that things are gonna be different now but um at the same time like i'm also sort of seeing some similarities between this and me and my and my mom and my dad and that scares the heck out of me um but [inaudible] that like just hung out with some friends that are not quite in my friends group but really enjoyed it think like them but one of the girls has been ostracized from my friends group due to some of them previous actions in the beginning of the year um but think did [inaudible] and think it was good opportunity to do so currently i'm just super tired and i'm feeling like some men are just not great for me but i'm also sort of in this loop where like there somebody who wants me and whatever but are not ready to be in relationship then there somebody who think are attractive don't know if it like me but like hasn't done anything but whatever i'm struggling basically [inaudible] like wanna make out with somebody wanna love somebody wants somebody to love me and to wants me i'm just feeling little unloved right now and that hard um today was okay and got some work done on this essay that i'm really struggling with got some extension on it um am yeah just came back from hanging out with some friends different friends group went to dinner for my friends birthday today um one of my other friends is really struggling with her relationship so that was kind of hard to see but feel like just have lot work to do and i'm trying to be productive that is quite hard on the weekends and [inaudible] even and i'm super tired but i've like lot of work to do tomorrow so will be up late doing so much work um let see other than that things have been okay i've been like talking to some other guys um but the guys that have like known and i'm actually friends with realize still have some tendencies occasionally for so that rough but yeah just don't know what to do what gonna happen with anything so i'm just sort of taking things the way it go not [inaudible] anything too much 'cause it just hurts me in the end so figured not to give anything too much weight but i'm also this is weird to say and really don't enjoy saying it out loud 'cause it just it weird but i'm like quite horny which is don't know it not bad but like guess i'm just really craving don't know kissing or something but i've never done that which is weird so yeah i'm just like in very weird position right now really tired haven't stayed up this late in long time have lot of work um don't like saving my work to the last minute and that definitely what today was result of so definitely won't do that i'm gonna try to get ahead with my work so don't have that much to do this weekend um hopefully can actually follow through with that plan um but yeah other than that i'm just really trying to focus on work went to my professor house today and it was absolutely amazing um not only was his home beautiful and his like family was just amazing and warm and welcoming and everything was you know set um it reminded me little bit of home in terms of not necessarily like rhode island but what that image of success looks like again and like why tried so hard to get here and what i'm hoping for and like how happy and safe wanna feel and so that just sort of like revived things for me which was amazing and also like hung out with different people got little bit closer with the other kids and that was awesome so like yeah today was like really interesting experience had lot of work but my time was well-spent think was pretty productive today didn't do lot of work with friends other than math which is like study group and like the math questions on there was like you're kind of doing things on your own other people is just kind of there and they're like tas answering questions so yeah today was pretty good day super super exhausted um finished most of my work that due tomorrow just have really short reading have to do but i'm so exhausted have to go to bed [inaudible] wake up tomorrow to run have really busy day tomorrow um and it terms of today uh went to this meeting [inaudible] politics um with the secretary of health um donna shalala and that was really awesome um just to hear her experience coincidentally one of my guy friends also ended up being chosen from the lottery to go so it was just really interesting um haven't seen my other friends group in while and my roommate made really good point today after expressed um some worries about the friends group as in things just felt different and felt sort of out of the loop because hadn't you know been with her as much as maybe it had been with each other or something um she said you don't have friends group you have individual friends and it can get together and you can all be friends but you don't have friends group and that was awesome she just so incredible and she always have good insights and that made me feel lot better and um made me reevaluate you know how perceive friends and friends group and how don't need to be like groupie guess don't even know what groupie is but that how i'm gonna use the word um yeah other than that i'm genuinely exhausted and i'm also feeling like and i'm just evaluating my friends group and like with my guy friends who saw at the meeting um it was just like really inspiring you know and he like he driven guess and was really driven and feel like lost little bit of that so i'm trying to get it back my other friends don't quite see that as much um and he also really wants to be president and wanna be in government so like that like similarity that we have obviously i'm not necessarily in the same page but either way um but there also some tension there as in like he'll say things like oh [will she] be like don't know the secretary of education or the first lady and things like that which is like interesting don't know just don't know what to think so i'm interested in this other guy now and now it feel like that i'm ready to move on he ready to get started with me and don't like that so yeah today was okay pretty structured was very busy had lot of things to do um didn't get lot of work done as had hoped to um but still making progress trying to prepare for the game this weekend think it gonna be really hard to do work so i'm just trying to prepare for that is it going well not quite um also saw made deeper connection with uh one of my friends who kinda felt like was worried about um as close as yesterday so mean that was good we sort of just like straightened things out um and yeah so got some closure got closer in other relationships and things um but yeah most things really was just really busy with school met some really awesome person um who is running for governor in colorado and was really inspired by them so emailed them see if can help them over the summer with their campaign and such and that was really exciting it such great experience like was just so happy that was taking the class but also that like it was so open to uh help and just just hearing the details and it shared details of like where to go from where you is now is really something that made me feel really excited super busy day today um really just class class meeting meeting um mainly it kind of catching up where like don't have time for some homework sometimes which is really not great really don't love going to bed this late um yeah i'm really just not feeling it at all so hopefully that'll change also my face is breaking out don't know if it stress or what but that that annoying as well um so hopefully that'll fix itself just have lot to do have midterm tomorrow feel semi-prepared for but really don't know i'm just like nervous guess but yeah hopefully things go well and in terms of social things didn't see lot of my friends today saw one of my friends at um dinner just by coincidence [inaudible] so could go get tutoring um got my econ back as some actual grade like in the raw score it not very good but in the scale am like pretty average like got minus with the scale which think is huge improvement for me definitely still wanna do better but it did give me little bit of confidence saying that like okay you can improve like yeah the course itself sucks and the way it manage it sucks but like you can get better so yeah um pretty all right day today was really busy with just work and classes didn't have lot of time to do homework which is pattern that i'm starting to see um which is little bit problematic so need to fix that um my friend was leaving today to go home and we just talked about how it'd be kind of weird and then thought about thanksgiving and uh how it would be weird for me as well but haven't really given much thought to it um yes i'm gonna miss hit lot but um it really important that he do this it big deal and yeah he kinda just was like you mean lot to me and like really um rock with you on deeper level than even thought did and that was sort of news for me and makes me rethink what wanna do with other guys and stuff um but yeah just really wanna get work done harvard [inaudible] is this weekend so i'm trying to get ahead and work and as result did not work today which was really unfortunate but hopefully i'll be able to get some work done tomorrow um and yeah went out to dinner today with my friend 'cause it was my friend birthday um upcoming events that have in mind really is just like tests like and like big projects really wanna do really well and realize that it little late but really want to um so i'm going to work on that which mean i'm starting early with everything but yeah um pretty interesting day today didn't get any work done um went to bed really late last night so had hard time waking up this morning didn't wake up early didn't go to the gym um again did not do any homework was not as productive as i'd hoped to be but then again also didn't have much time had to pack um pick up some things um definitely feeling stressed about social situations more so than academic situations um really struggling with like love life um friends little bit there was like little bit of tension about getting on certain buses to get to harvardyale which is this weekend something else was little bit worried about was um like being parent this weekend and just like looking out for my friends and making sure that they're not like too drunk or whatever but think that was mostly in my head um and think they're gonna be fine but like even if things do happen i'm okay with being that person one because care about them and two like what else am gonna be doing so yeah i'm just taking it day by day um i'm definitely every day wishing more that was in relationship but that that like low-key stressed about school as in like really wanna get my grades up and it like not even like what it used to be where it like need to get my grades up or whatever it like want to genuinely want to do well 'cause like like the classes and wish that my work reflected that um but yeah pretty interesting day today um we went to the harvard-yale game today which was in um [redacted] so yesterday went on the bus there today um woke up we went to get breakfast after waiting little too long for some of my friends to get ready then we went to the complex uh which was where the game was went to the tailgates went to the game for little bit then went back to the tailgates um and really it was just like lot of dancing dancing with people um lot of alcohol everywhere didn't drink don't feel pressured to drink either which was really great and also didn't have to be parent to any of my friends which would not have minded but um it was cool that that didn't happen and then let see um yeah also hung out with [girlfriend] one-on-one today we just got some food and watched some netflix that was about it new friends different friends group it felt comfortable you know it felt kinda normal which is good um one of my friends today this this was the last day that would see her um until after thanksgiving break and was really sad about it um and like met her here so she friends that made here during the peer rotation program and we've gotten really close um and cried cried twice actually and it only gonna be like 10 or so day or something but like don't know was just like really really saddened by that and it makes me really worried for like uh winter break even spring break you know it just like you get so close to this people 'cause you're always with her always surrounded by her so like day apart from her really feel like months 'cause time goes so quickly yet so slowly here um other than that yeah kinda just like wanted to hang out with guy not hang out with guy but like do things with guy this weekend and didn't and that okay think i'm okay with that decision i'm not sure why really wanted to in the first place um so that was some internal strife had but yeah got over it um not any drama today well actually um today some girls was looking for the bus to get back home so it was calling texting had me share my location with her and things so finally when me who had been there for some hour waiting the bus was for the bus was ready to get on it weren't responding to me so called to makes sure that it got on the bus and it was already on it it was like oh yeah we're already on the bus um and then said okay is there room for three more 'cause thought we was all planning on sitting together and it was like no really don't think so which you know that was weird within itself just not great experience 'cause like we spent lot of time helping her standing in the rain waiting for her for her to already be there and not say anything and then on top of that once actually get on the bus guess who there both of her just like really some interesting experience and like spoke to my friends about it who was also there it was like we [inaudible] fre fake friends from some incident that happened with her way in the beginning of the year that [inaudible] guy drama but essentially have to do with trust and communication once again so that was something to think um pretty relaxed day today spent most of my time by myself woke up kind of early at first for fire alarm then went back to bed after that and feel like got pretty good night rest despite that interruption um but yeah mean really spent most my time by myself and just did homework got little bit ahead which is good but also i'm kinda not stressed 'cause like thanksgiving and it doesn't really feel real but know that like doesn't know like i'm doing my work but doesn't need to be that far ahead um on top of that also made plans with somebody for tomorrow night which is new thing for me 'cause usually [inaudible] like school night to school night but already have that much homework anyways so it'll be okay um yeah so other than that like genuinely did not do much today like at all and was actually okay with that you know was just like really relaxed just doing my thing and yeah also spoke to my friend lot um over the phone he talking listening to his dad tell stories and stuff really nervous feel like i'm dealing with two guys right now and one doesn't want to be in relationship yet but is still calling me thing like wifey and whatever and then another one is interested and i'm interested as well and he somebody that doesn't remind me of my father who was like somewhat abusive and thing so think it something that should go for because doesn't wanna be in the same position that my mom was in so that something that like [redacted] stressing in the back of my mind but doesn't really know but um yeah so i'm trying to pursue the second one we'll see what happens well yeah and then that-that been my pretty chillax day so on walk home now just watched two movies with this guy and just kinda snuggled or whatever which was fine feeling okay except that i'm walking home by myself and know that the other guy that know is unhealthy for me um would have never let me walk home by myself but it is what it is and it was just too much stimulation guess so yeah i'm walking home i'm feeling don't know how i'm feeling but i'm okay um yeah i'm just other than that today have been really relaxed day um got my homework done for tomorrow like so early which was awesome and think it because had knew that won't be able to do work tonight so guess that good for my work ethic you know knowing that like when need to get stuff done get it done so yeah pretty okay day today pretty normal um i'm home um because it thanksgiving break so i'm just reading currently but today was pretty relaxed day went to class and didn't really see anybody today met some people at lunch ended up hanging out with them but that was pure coincidence um yeah it was just me today really packing and getting ready and struggling bit with one of my guy friends and understanding what he wants from me if he wants me to wait for them in terms of having relationship or just do whatever and so he saying not to wait for me and that you know when he ready he'll he'll come for me so that makes things easier with my other friends um yeah so that was really the only stress went through today didn't do lot of homework um but i'm planning on being productive tomorrow we will see how that goes so yeah um i'd say it wasn't bad went to breakfast with my dad woke up kind of late went to bed late as well though um let see saw some friends saw lot of friends actually was so happy to see them um just reminded me of who used to be who was and who still am guess and the people that have helped me become who am and just like the amazingness that i've come from and felt strong again feel like can go back into the world and remember who [redacted] was who she stands for and such um yeah it was just like such great experience like i'm so happy saw them and like yes we've gotten older but have we changed absolutely not and really appreciate that about my friends and think they're so real for it so just feel very grateful um also saw some family unfortunately all it ask is how [redacted] better get all as how [redacted] so that was that but things happen um pretty short-ish day today would say um woke up little bit late tried to do some homework facetimed friends and family spoke to friends on the phone so really only got one piece of work done today so wasn't super productive spent time with my family um which is good little bit of fear of missing out north carolina with the rest of my family but i'm also glad i'm here and can just go home whenever um yeah talking to my friend-ish i'm not sure what to call him yet but i've been liking [inaudible] stuff and he expressed that he like misses me he call me beautiful or whatever and like which is nice he just great person but feel like don't know him so i'm struggling with that bit but yeah and i'm just really ready to go to bed after going black friday shopping and being utterly unsuccessful um pretty relaxed day today went shopping with my mom spent some quality time with her which was good watched movies it was very relaxed ate pretty normal amount um yeah today was just like lot of doing the same thing so like we was just shopping like walking around the mall expressing disappointment as black friday often causes um yeah really like nothing today spoke to my friend um over text lot and like him he like me we're aware of that um don't really know we're not like in relationship or anything or dating or anything but definitely building towards something which is new for me but i'm feeling this feeling that haven't felt before with guy where just like don't know he just really cute and like he makes my heart smile little bit and um that new um but other than that yeah actually been dodging calls today from the other guy who i'm just friend with but um still just like too much calling don't wanna talk on the phone all the time but yeah um pretty okay day today went to the stores with my mom spent some quality time with her um spoke lot to um one of my friends um got to see my friends that haven't seen in really long time um once got back to campus which was super exciting and really didn't feel lot of stress today got some work done keep forgetting that it saturday um which guess unintentionally i've been using as some excuse to not work as hard and be okay with not doing as much which is problematic but that okay it not okay actually um but yeah definitely did get some work done today and and hoping to get more done tomorrow but yeah everything seems all right um pretty interesting day today friend slept over went to the gym then uh we'll tried to go to the gym multiple times then just went for an actual run and then went to brunch then did homework went to uh dinner and did more homework went to math question center facetimed friend who interested in me um have no idea if i'm interested in him also don't know how to do these things and i'm feeling really stressed about that situation like extremely stressed out to the point where like don't know what i'm feeling and i'm like well not angry but i'm just like frustrated because don't know what to do and just like yeah and i'm just like yeah just wish knew what to do guess but other than that nothing incredibly crazy have really happened today i've genuinely just been stressed about the situation um but now that it happened i'm like don't know how feel about him don't even know if i'm interested in him don't see what he see in me just really nerve-racking but it is what it is apparently um pretty stressful day today went to the gym i'm getting bigger which is not good um also had lot of social um discussions or like stress guess um had good conversation with one of my friends who haven't really connected with in the level that we have before in quite some time and you know we both related on the struggles that we have with my family and my family structure and mental and physical abuse and and parents and fathers and things and um had been noticing something in this one guy that have been hanging out with where he did lot of things that is very similar to the things that my fathers did and i've tried to push it away and tried to ignore the signs but it was there and when she had told me that she'd recognized some of that same traits um it kind of hit me hard and my other friends have been saying like oh you know don't don't just ignore that signs yada yada yada but he don't have that experience so like understood it and like knew he was looking out for me but also knew that he was on my side and he didn't really like him whereas this girl pretty good friends with this guy um and like pretty good friends with me but she also relates to me on that level of understanding what it like to have parents like that so um that was just really eye-opening to me and really stressful and just like made lot of tension at dinner like moving uh just moving around and like being pulled aside and asked to talk and just having hostile hostile situation where just didn't enjoy it but after that kind of just isolated myself went to meeting where felt so inspired and so great and so ready to work and like just grind and really do well and and it it was meeting with the whole bunch of kids from the undergraduate council um and they're just doing awesome things and that we're working on getting multicultural center here and he was like you should run for uc and was like you know what what is stopping me other than fear so just felt reinspired and made me feel lot more determined to do my work and get it all done so now i'm heading to bed and feel accomplished because pretty much crossed off everything on my list pretty interesting day today um super busy which really loved was doing stuff was productive to degree socialized enough had great dinner with my teacher some new friends which is really exciting it was awesome um also had weird interaction with one guy friends the newer one um and we're at the mqc and he finished his thing at 830 and it was the time was approaching 1015 and was like oh when did you finish your pset and he said 830 and said what is you still doing here and he took that as like why is you here in like negative way and didn't mean that but that how he took it and he kind of well he didn't storm off immediately but he like slowly like packed up and whatever and didn't really say that he was upset about it but could tell um so that was weird and then texted him later about it and he was just like no just really missed you and like knew took it the wrong way but that was just straight in the moment yada yada yada and was like okay i'm just really struggling with the idea of missing people that you don't know and don't know how this kid like me when he don't know me and misses me when we barely had any like normal interaction so that something i'm like really struggling with um also the older the other guy um that like been here for quite some time and has been causing lot of my struggle um today asked if he could take me to play and then some dinner and he wants to take me out and that his dad said to him today um don't let [inaudible] be the one that got away whatever and was just getting over this hump of can't be with you right now i'm not ready you remind me too much of my dad yada yada so that little bit stressful but i'm also feeling great 'cause i'm just like was productive today it was just such balanced day and really loved it um yeah didn't really see lot of my like normal close friends though which just realized now but um yeah also has like lot of work to do but think should go to bed um then also has to gym and i'm overweight which the scale retold me today so that was exciting um but yeah so now need to figure out how to actually eat well today was an okay day um reconnected with friend that made kind of in the beginning of the year um she is really nice really like her um very much like the friend that had back home and here lot of my friend identify as the same race or identity um as do and she do not so that was nice and just sort of like it didn't matter didn't make difference obviously um but it made me feel like was branching out more so in the way that i'd like to um today also hit my head really hard um feeling concussioned-ish but we'll see what happens made doctor appointment um uh let see didn't really see lot of my other friend today um but just did work going to bed early because don't feel good because of my head which is unfortunate um have lot of papers to work on and feel like i've been like work on it little bit but don't know what that means and so i'm really struggling with actually working on it um also need to go to the gym i'm fat and there lot of fat on my stomach and don't like it i'm not used to that also late on my period since i'm kinda moody but also usually get frustrated really easily might have concussions have i've had four um and one of my friend have expressed interest in me and now wants to approach being in relationship um wanted me to come see him tonight and told him to come see me and at first he was like what and then he was like sure and he said he'd come um texted him three times and he hasn't responded which is abnormal from him um and he have test tomorrow so like i'm not mad but did get frustrated really easily and was just like what in the world is going on need to be held to the same standards that he held to so like when you come at me for not responding or not seeing you for day or something like this is two-way street you know hold an responsibility you have agency in this situation as well so like that don't know then with the other guy hasn't spoken to him at all today don't really know what to do that experience had with him recently of him getting kind of frustrated because said why is you here not in that sense as in like and not sure if said this yesterday but was um at the mqc the math question center um got there kind of late around 900-ish and this guy was there um and it was around 1015 and was like hey like when did you finish the [psat] because he was finishing an essay and then he finished that he started playing on rubik cube he was like oh finished at 830 mind you mqc starts at 830 so was like what is you still doing here like you finished long ago and he took that as why is you here and um was like well can leave if you wants and was like that not what meant at all um but like he didn't storm off or anything but he like went to the bathroom and obviously there was mood change he very like bubbly sort of light-hearted person and the person that interacted with after that was not that person um so just texted him about it and he was like oh i'm sorry just really miss you knew you didn't means it that way as soon as walked out but just really miss you i'm not used to not seeing you this often and i'm just like confused as to like how do you miss somebody that you don't know how do you like somebody you don't know um so that been on my mind and feel like should confront that issue today was pretty great for most of the time um it was super busy jam-packed in the schedule first class well had meeting at 11 o'clock but her meeting before was going over so had to reschedule my first class at 1130 until 230 then from 300 to 400 had office hours 400 to 500 had class 500 to 800 had women center preparation for the event and then the event um 800 to 900 had an event for my path then 900 to 1030 had math question center and then that wasn't enough time for me so well no no actually 900 to 930 went to my um mandatory um study break for my entryway left early 'cause really had to do homework and then from 930 to 1030 was at the math question center until it closed then up until about like 10 15 minutes ago just left the library to finish the math homework um and my econ homework still have to do more econ tomorrow um didn't really see lot of my friends saw one in passing made an new friends saw an pretty good people and yeah saw another friends that was really good to see um little bit of tension with the weird situation or opportunity which is in general was talking about my computer screen background which was van gogh um and he was like you wanna see my background he was being playful and it was like picture of clearly him drawn and it was just funny this was like van gogh and then like picture that like ten-year-old could have drawn or something and he was like my girlfriend drew it or whatever and so an guys was laughing and they're like it probably the worst i've ever seen and don't know how he took it and don't know if he got mad or he just was like focused in his work um but that was sort of like weird situation he said he was fine but don't think he really was um but yeah and currently my friends this guys who i've been like he been pretty important part of my life for an time now for well my harvard time the guys that always influences my day somehow um he have been really weird lately and like hasn't been responding to me hasn't been trying to see me anymore or anything which is weird 'cause i'm not sure what did wrong or what did to change that and i'm just questioning everything now and this is directly after you said that he kinda wants to move forward with me so i'm just utterly confused but feel like i'm knowing great things here i'm feeling better about myself at harvard and i'm really okay with that uh pretty long day today class class meeting nap first successful nap it was amazing meeting um socializing with friends dinner wanted to do bit of work today definitely didn't get to do that was definitely feeling some symptoms of concussion i'm starting to feel it now should be taking things easy but of course didn't do that 'cause was struggling [essentially] with somebody kind of got [inaudible] but yeah now i'm just gonna go straight to bed this is too much um today was interesting started off okay got worse and worse as the day went on and i've been getting really frustrated really quickly um and suddenly and i'm not quite sure how to handle it um and feeling like i've had to cry for really long time can't really get there got mad at my friend in like split second today and then it was fine don't even know why got mad at her um then like bumped into her like literally minutes later and was like sorry like i'll see you guys later and she didn't say anything but the my other friend did and then it just reminded me of conversation had with someone that went on date with yesterday and just like how quickly people switch and how much hate that and how find that so scary and wonder if scared her and if things would be the same don't know um but yeah so that happened i'm stressing over writing this paper and just can't cannot get it do uh on the paper don't know what to say don't know how to write this types of paper um on top of that just feel really stressed don't feel good like i'm sick now can't focus um it hurts to look at screens for too long need to sleep my dad is gonna disown me in like couple of day already know it he already starting this whole process and it just coming at really bad time um and i'm struggling with like letting that experiences affect everything else that do um and like other people that interact with because know that my dad is not normal but shouldn't expect other people to be like that as well and just feel bad for treating people differently because maybe felt like saw similar trait or something um yeah just i'm sad i'm so sad i'm just like really sad and can't even cry about it yeah pretty stressful day today um lot of social tension within friend groups we added someone to our friend groups that immediately backfired um in terms of information shared not staying within four walls uh so have some tension with the person that went on date on um hopefully not with this new girl who in our groups because really like her like we met at [inaudible] and she just awesome you know um but yeah have been thinking lot about our dad today dealing with rejection overthinking social interactions i'm just really struggling and i'm overthinking everything so i'm just going to not say anything from now on when it comes to me and this guy and i'm just not going to think about anything at all not thing i'm just going to be the same person was which is the person he liked and we'll take it from there um schoolwork got some work done on our paper today um but realize that working on the same thing all day is not it not conducive so will be splitting up our time tomorrow with math and econ and little bit of our paper um yeah but now i'm just trying to get some shut-eye long day today reconnected with an old friend not old friend friend haven't seen in while he gave me so much insight basically i'm making the wrong decision in pursuing relationship with this guy and need to stop and need to listen to everyone because they're right and just don't wanna believe um myself right now so that happening wasn't as productive as i'd wanted to be today will not be seeing anyone tomorrow except for breakfast and um yeah basically friend aren't really my friend just one person actually um and yeah this person is not right for me and need to make sure that stick by this conclusion other important things um no not really that was basically the bulk of my day the reason got stressed today is because of him sad because of him somewhat happy because of him basically think just want relationship when i'm willing to do it with anybody which is so problematic but also know that not true i'm not willing to do it with anybody because push away person that aren't him and it just so problematic and basically just need to reevaluate my life and understand that like wanna be like pleased and like think just just like more body or i'm horny or something but don't know what to do so yeah pretty interesting day um had got some like great work done was pretty productive did lot of econ finished my paper which was great um currently yeah finished my paper went to library went to econ office hours and then um brought my friend [redacted] went to cvs visited another friend um that friend one went on date on was thoroughly disgusted by him [inaudible] and he called me coward um so that don't practice the words that say and was wondering when was gonna be done with the space of you know me monitoring myself around him i'll say my thoughts being quiet and whatnot um honestly just felt really disrespected and not because of what he said of what he called me it just that he really value his friendship and and as always cast out my definition of friendship my definition of friendship is all or nothing whatever whatever and it was fine but um my definition is uplifting and he wouldn't just call me coward if he was friend until you're being kind and here how you do it or know you can do this here what you need to do that not what he did and he came at me he don't let me finish he makes me feel powerless he makes me feel terrible about myself makes me feel stupid i'm in for some reason i'm still trying to like this man so this saturday would be my last date with him yeah [tertiary] 'cause this is i'm better than this i'm stronger than this and i'm not being my best self and think break is going to reveal lot of things so yeah um interesting day today was more confrontational that have been in while um but think it turned out well um got most of what wanted to say out got some closure realized some things um about my relationship with this guy um very negative not healthy relationship and i'm okay i'm okay with canceling that relationship maybe not entirely but definitely keeping it as something that remains friends because deserve to be loved and i'm smart and care about people and care about myself to continue with that today after talking to this guy after yesterday night he called me coward and so found all of the things he hates about me um we had conversation and he said something along the lines of perhaps he subconsciously trying to not like me because he holds me to different standards and he holds black women to different standards than he does of white women and he doesn't quite know what it is to be black yet and i'm not sure where hatred ties into that argument or where purposeful disgust of someone is necessary however am okay and am strong black women and am proud of my blackness not that it uniform but that it unique and appreciate mine as much as appreciate everyone else and um think i've just grown tonight and i'm really glad that have really good friends like my friends um that reconnected with not reconnected but like just who haven't seen in while and um he was just so helpful gave me some mental support gave me advice told me to text him after with the number 501 or for any help or if i'm okay and that just like that something you want not even in relationship it doesn't have to be like that just from friends like uh this people really care and like know what to does you know and that just just like really really appreciated that and one of my friends left today um for good for all of winter break it doesn't quite feel real yet but she just gonna be gone for whole month and half that just crazy you know 'cause we've gotten so close to this people and i'm hoping that this break for me is time of rebirth and renewal um but i'm just really wanna does well in my exams so i'm gonna focus on that focus on myself the goodness of what deserve which is nothing less than the best um pretty good day today was able to finish my paper hand in two paper which means now just have to study for my two exams not feeling super prepared for them but did some good work around them um in terms of social interactions got to hang out with lot of my friends that really like spent minimum time with people that made friends with that don't necessarily enjoy spending time with um and avoided some confrontation today but now i'm feeling okay i'm just going to bed now i'm really tired and think just need to reclaim myself and in doing that need to cut off some relationships so yeah pretty interesting day today um made some big decision to just stay friends with person that went on one date with i'm feeling relaxed um other than that got some [inaudible] having hard time focusing felt terrible super sick um think have really bad sinus infection or don't know what but we're definitely struggling but yeah just kinda feel like there weight off my chest now i'm not sad probably will be tomorrow but you know other than that try to be productive don't know how to study i'm not feeling super prepared but [inaudible] okay day today subconsciously coping with losing friend think um got some work done did some studying saw my friend who is pretty awesome told me to believe in myself whatever he just very good friend to have and he struggling bit and wish could advise him as much as he advise me but it is what it is um other than that pretty nonchalant day um dealt with some rooming situations but that all set now so yeah today was really just low-key studying eating studying um didn't really see any of my friend today so it was interesting um today was pretty laid back just did lots of studying um printed out new practice exam to take today and did terribly on it didn't finish it um but like the multiple choice was just awful and i'm feeling lots of pressure because really need to do well um to get good grade um but just don't know what to do i'm studying i'm reviewing and like maybe i'm just not studying well but also don't know how to study then like it-it just i'm just struggling so tomorrow i'm gonna redo practice exam that did to make sure that remember what did wrong um and yeah and so like feel like know things and in theory could do them but little there little bit of confidence issue and this is for economics um that i'm struggling with but just really need to do well and i'm like praying spending all my time on it and math just really really really really really wanna do well and this has really made me extra determined to do well next semester because this is and don't like this feeling like to do well so yeah i'm just hoping things get better and feel really dumb so over winter break i'm literally going to school i'm going to read and i'm going to write i'm gonna study get ahead of my homework and know say this now but like actually can't do this like just can't so need to get ahead but yeah that really all that been on my mind pretty good day today um saw the friend that recently said would stay friend with um went pretty well had quick little phone call things are pretty normal and appreciate it lot made me feel good and then have my econ exam tomorrow excited nervous terrified um i'm not confident in anything to ever say that i'm ready for something um but i've definitely put in lot of work so hopefully it pays off but guess we shall see i'm pretty nervous but hope things will end well because need them to um but also worked really really hard and um just really need to do well so that that um yeah i've just really been studying today went to the gym to see my trainer i've been sort of slacking on self-care really need to wash my hair so that gotta happen asap but also have an exam friday so will have time tomorrow to wash my hair probably not will do it anyways well it possible um so yeah hoping yeah just really need to do well tomorrow and that all that really on my mind right now [i'm still] going to bed early wake up early hopefully my roommate are done [inaudible] go to bed um but yeah um pretty okay day today have math test tomorrow don't really know how feel feel like little um don't know if feel prepared because those test always kind of take you by landslide but um definitely feel like put in some work more and more worried about econ as the day go on but i'm like not someone who usually worried about grades but people here talk about them lot so it just like have me thinking about them but i'm hoping those things turn out well and those can like really really just really do well next semester um some tension with my dad today definitely some issues with those sector where today he sent message saying those he no longer in the picture so those those and um yeah it not something those unexpected happens lot but it really surprising at this age he still playing this games and i'm 18 years old but other than those nothing really been on my mind other than studying and my friend today said hope you don't come back different from break and those really made me question lot of things as well in terms of like what would change what is staying the same those maybe people like but perhaps don't and what more important in those as well so just been coming across those thoughts recently but honestly i'm just ready to restart next semester 'cause just did so trash this one um pretty okay day today took my math exam not quite sure how felt about it um i'm worried there worried about my grades but really need to do well want to do well in the class and this has definitely awakened me um and really told me to do better next semester which is what must do and will do without doubt um but yeah other than that now after took my exam finished at 500 just felt pretty relaxed so played some wall ball by myself my other friend here is leaving tomorrow morning saw him for bit my friend who here till like sunday or monday um she writing paper so she very busy so didn't see her but yeah mean it pretty chill day saw some newer friend and yeah now i'm hoping to just read tomorrow having lot of roommate drama lo lot of roommate tension people not being willing to move respect way need and want after has sacrificed the whole semester it can't sacrifice one day but you know we're not all adults here guess which is unfortunate but the truth so i'm dealing with that that been i'd say the biggest stress other than my exam on my mind and took my friend out to dinner today um this is the guy that went on date on while ago we decided that wasn't gonna work um had really good time we just has like good comfortable relaxed time when we when it just me but also has like every people telling me that he bad for me so don't know what to do but yeah that about my life um pretty stressful day today with my roommates um i've had lot of struggle with getting my stuff moved into my single lot of people being very disrespectful very childish and that was something didn't think i'd encounter for long time or really again but was very wrong um and think that'll make me see my roommates in very different light when return um and feel like side of me came out today that never wanna see again it was just rude and not nice and confrontational to an extent that was just aggressive and didn't like that so won't be doing that again but now that the process is over and moved in i'm happy and now i'm home i'm with my cat just wanna relax and read so yeah um really relaxed day today just walked around with mom lot um saw an old friend which was really great to see we talked about our struggles in college mostly social i'm really scared of our grades and that something that hasn't changed um but i'm like really really nervous and just wanna do really well um but i'm not sure this is the best start but think [inaudible] with [inaudible] please forgive me from our our sins and please help me [inaudible] just kidding just started praying here that how scared was um but yeah i'm like really tired so that probably why just mixed that up as well um but i'm just sort of ready for bed i've been reading an really great books and feel like i've been replenishing our mind with like actual vocabulary and like things to talk about which is good um but yeah other than that it like really chill nothing happens as much um in rhode island but like also just in general compared to when i'm actually at college like there always like multiple things multiple people [seen] and like here that just not happening at all but i'm kind of okay with it for now um pretty interesting day today spent some time with my dad to pick up my stuff from my dorm um spoke to some friends on the phone uh for really long time on skype um and really happy did in light of reevaluating my friends groups uh think this friends groups that just spoke with really stimulates my mind in very different way than my other friends whereas it mostly playful with them and and you know just like cheery laughing being goofy as with this friends can actually have some intellectual discussion and and really really appreciate that and value that and it makes me feel great and it also inspires me to like be the people that we talk about later on like when we see somebody who gonna be really successful like wanna be the people that you think about and like that what we were just talking about and then people on campus and that really strike me as somebody who gonna be something and really wanna be that people um so yeah that just how i'm feeling right now i'm feeling really good about that relationships that i've solidified um pretty okay day today spent most of my time by myself um woke up pretty early [inaudible] look over the full list [inaudible] i'm just really tired put on some frasier so can go to bed um just went to work out and got my nails done was really by myself and and liked it was relaxed am stressed about my grades don't know if they're gonna be good or bad i'm really nervous about them um but also um am worried about this extracurricular that i'm applying for on top of the many others that have too so that but i'm okay like know wanna do that but yeah um pretty okay day um sent in an application got asked to interview um was mostly by myself today um when did see my mom we was fine spoke to my dad he upset with me saying that pushed him away while was in college and that basically i've lost him and that things won't be the same which is interesting um and think unfair but not new new from him um so yeah i'm just struggling with that guess was fine until this happened which was very recently like maybe 10-15 minutes ago so yeah um other than that nothing really happened today just sat by myself lot did work that it um pretty good day today hung out with my friend from high school or really from elementary school which was awesome and definitely spoke about like life decisions i'm making and things and to cut myself some slack but also make change take things easy [inaudible] and she helped me with my social relationship in terms of this guy um yeah she was really helpful and i'm glad spoke to her we just kinda chilled um but yeah i'm hoping to see my other friend even had some conversations with my dad and that didn't go well as usual he saying that should look for support from my friend and not him because things aren't the same anymore so yeah don't even know what to think of that um but that pretty normal for my relationship where he just like to drop 'cause of things that don't really have control over like my voice probably but you know it is what it is um i'm hurt by it really miss my friend from college and one of her you know speak to her about every day he pretty great but still miss him 'cause don't really like to see him which is interesting and i'm figuring out that really really do like him so we'll see what happens pretty relaxed day today um spent most of my time with my mom uh went to dinner with her we didn't have lunch but had late breakfast so it fine uh had some discussions about her relationship with my dad christmas and you know whether he gonna be there or not um spoke to my friend today one on facetime and another on the phone as usual spoke to him every day [inaudible] um he mentioned something he saw his ex-girlfriend um and she was basically like she still loves him or whatever and like don't know if he don't like her anymore 'cause know he kept saying like he not depressed he over it like the whole like situation but then later on when asked him another question um and we was comparing his relationship his old relationship to my friend he was like she perfect there you know it weren't things to talk about nobody could tell me about her blah blah blah and was just like really heard that and was like hmm are it really done where are in this equation where should be in this equation [inaudible] about that little bit but definitely do like him um but not as friend and yeah we just uh just need to see where things go so this break are just really interesting [inaudible] we'll see today was okay um woke up worked out and then was with my mom all day and we just went christmas shopping for my dad we drove all the way up to boston then when we called him and made him answer it was sort of like the icing on the cake for him sort of not treating us very nicely um so then we left like as soon as we got there we parked we sat for five minutes and then we left and we went back home then we went shopping for him here and um had another fit over that ended up buying things he got mad at us said he was done with us this is my dad um yeah and he was basically saying i'm distant didn't treat him the same in school blah-blah-blah same things essentially think he just doesn't like us but at this point doesn't really like care but know nothing gonna change and so like that was that but um yeah then we went home and ate then spoke to my friend uh who sick in hopes that he feels better we also spoke about um [tanni hificous] and cornel west and that whole debacle and then spoke to my friend on facetime 'cause she going to ghana for the next five weeks so i'll miss her lot and yeah then did some work and i'm going to bed pretty late now but yeah that my day pretty good day today um got some great closure um met with my mom family today which we haven't done in really long time um and it was great saw my uncle who haven't seen lot um recently and also in my life he been in and out of jail um we sort of just like see him around or like by surprise so it was nice seeing him today and um he sort of apologized for everything and you know shared that he wanted to be part of my life and that things was just not working for him and that he was really struggling um and him not being there entirely wasn't wasn't enough for him um but he really proud of me and lot of my family um just said how much it was proud of me um for going to harvard and it said you know it always knew was smart and found myself questioning again what that characteristics or that qualities are um but if everyone else saw it i'm wondering why can't see it um the same time it also reminded me what i'm doing at harvard why i'm doing what i'm doing who i'm doing it for i'm doing it for my family i'm doing it for people like my family and it was just really really great experience we was there for good five hours um we also saw my mom other friend um which was really nice we had lunch with her had some good conversations um yeah she asked me about school as well um by coincidence right before we saw her saw her ex-husband walking with one of her kids um and didn't wanna say hi um just because he almost killed her um he almost killed hi ex-wife which was who we met with for lunch and just didn't feel comfortable so just let him walk by and told my mom and she just let him walk by as well um so that was really interesting but think today was really good day and met with the side of my family that don't usually see but are very grateful that did um not terrible day today um spent the morning with my mom opened some gifts it very relaxed day today uh my dad and my cousin came down eventually we went to dinner um and hung out there for bit spent some good time with my cousin things were really awkward and tense with my dad um but spoke to him maybe ten fifteen minutes ago and things seem to be okay now um i've decided to be the bigger person here and just uh recognize well over yesterday and today i'm starting to recognize what mean to other person and that not saying that i'm like this like amazing person or whatever but that like i'm person kid and person have known me from when were young and they're seeing me grow and i'm important to him as they're important to me and so when become distant which is by no mean on purpose or when it feel like i'm leaving him they're dealing with the loss that that very serious and very heavy and hadn't really taken that into account and which am now and i'm doing that um after giving someone else the same exact advice which is interesting how your own advice comes back to you buy yeah so that what i've just been dealing with i'm just ready to crack down on school and do really well think this next semester although i've been like thinking lot about boys and things um don't wanna deal with it wanna have friends yeah but i'm not old enough and i'm not ready to be in relationship as much as wanna be um and so need to recognize that and find myself first so that what i'll be doing pretty good day today um worked out um hang out with my mom all day went to the mall and shopping went to my mom friend house and then came home the day kind of started late so kind of felt [inaudible] that we didn't do much but had good time with her things went well um yeah working on the relationship with my dad um just read something by bell hooks about feminism um it really helping me sort of come up with these conversations on my own and and come up with comebacks and sort of broadening my vocabularies and it giving me the language to discuss these things and these issues of feminist theory um and i'm just really excited to come back to school and like just show people that know what i'm talking about show people that i'm actually smart because think lot of people at school think i'm actually stupid which am only to certain extent um so i'm hoping to be smarter at these upcoming semester and seem smarter as well pretty good day today um lots of time with my mom got my hair done um and then spent some time with my friends from high school which is awesome um and after that went to my mom friends house who has daughter that i'm pretty close with it was her 18th birthday um had some cake for her but also uh the night mostly consisted of having conversation um with her her boyfriend um about some tension that they're having he in college she in high school um there lots of tension there with like time talking to other people um the daughter also hit her boyfriend um which is really big deal and apparently she done it more than once um and this is important obviously because you should never put your hands on other people um but her father was abusive to her mother and almost killed her in fact so the fact that this has spread downwards um is very interesting um and so it sort of looked at my mom and as like third party to get advice on like the situation how to go about it not necessarily who is right or wrong but like just in reason and perspective on the situation and that was really interesting but today was pretty good day also spoke to my um two friends over facetime which was fun um and texted another people about um some issues they're having with um sexuality in terms of just being horny essentially um but yeah she got through that and helped her with that which was awesome pretty good day today um had an interview uh which went pretty well think um and really got me in the mood of like getting excited about academics again it was something that just felt really good after and was like wow wanna do great things wanna be doing something important um so that sort of revived something that haven't really felt in while and really appreciated that um spent an time with my dad today and my mom all three of me we went to

guiding force um spoke bit about religion today with my cousin who are jehovah witness i'm not quite sure what are at this point um but yeah just had really good talk so that something that need to think about bit more um but as of right now i'm just focusing on school god and myself pretty good day today um hung out with my mom and dad and spoke to my friend on the phone for quite some time um

legend people talk about blah blah blah and they made me feel great and at the same time they reminded me of the pressure that have to do well and to be something um and i'm glad were re-exposed to

my mom um she watches the tv while she works and didn't move into my own room um just to like you know not to isolate myself from her all day um so did that eventually went into my room today got it done now i'm just waiting for reports on um my [tf's] um but i'm yeah feeling good so like this goldman sachs thinking maybe he should visit my school tomorrow definitely have to works out because didn't move today at all um yeah that was about it didn't eat too much today had good three meals which is good but of course had three meals on the day that didn't move around at all and i've been having two meals day unintentionally so i'm going to figure this out but yeah that about it pretty good day today um woke up late um had some trouble sleeping last night but got up um chilled bit didn't really do any work today um but did go to the gym um had some good conversations with my mom friend um decided that should and that will get counselor or therapist don't really know the right terminology um because think i'd need that right now and know there nothing wrong with that just usually fear the first meeting um because always cry lot but think it absolutely necessary also feeling some health issues um had really sore throat for maybe three day now it just really hurts to swallow um but other than that i'm really happy got that um application done yesterday i'm getting more and more excited about it um and i'm just very grateful for the connections that i've made um though it may be small they're incredibly important um and i'm kind of happy so i'm going to read book called girl boss um and just wanna come into next semester confident ready um and just to really show my true self and i'm not sure if showed that this semester think got lost on what wanted to be in order to blend in um but that wasn't quite uh what should have done so dn i'm just so so excited to go back and the day is getting closer and closer and i'm really happy about that pretty okay day today um it started okay got progressively worse woke up at 800 um which is so early for me have done that in while it was so early that felt nauseous um and i'd like to get back to my old schedule um went to the mall with my mom met with her friend and her friend daughter for lunch then went to cambridge to meet with some of my former students have mini reunion thing um and on my way home started to get these text messages from my dad uh it was pretty horrendous telling me to change my name um he doesn't love me anymore thing will never be the same delete his number um he doesn't care about me he not paying for school stuff like that and so was fine um like and he spoke to my mom guess my mom like cried and stuff and and these is stuff that used to happen earlier in life um so i've kinda gotten used to it where it doesn't really affect me but also know that doesn't really feel emotions immediately um so was fine hearing her talk about it in the car she got bit emotional [hearing her] talk about it on the phone and then said just really need to take shower need to put on some music need to just understand what going on and just wash these all off of me so took shower um and heard one song and it said love is free and started to cry because if love is free then why do owe people for it um and so that was something that really really um touched me and that broke me just for bit but it was very short 10 15 seconds and then was fine got out the shower did my own thing and then sat and watched the ending to movie with my mom um she fell asleep on the couch but yeah um so guess you could say watched tv just to not focus on anything wrote um after my shower because really wanna write book that i'm gonna put the words that wrote into google document to really get my book started um and just really haven't felt these emotions in while and these is pressure for me to do well in school 'cause now really really have to so yeah pretty okay day today um started terribly with my dad arguing and saying some very not nice things um and then just had to just go over there figure out what going on as soon as got there he was fine so i'm glad got some closure with my dad um had good conversation with my mom mostly about everything that i've been doing wrong about how need to leave that in the past and really move forward and and also be very proactive with my life and do things on my own um guess i'm not child anymore and need to take charge need to care about myself um on top of that uh my dad and went out to eat woke up this morning went to bed at like 11-something and still woke up at 1100 oh was up for while and then went back to bed um so yeah still having trouble sleeping but um scheduled my flu shot which is not my physical and realize can't schedule my physical 'cause don't have physician um also try to schedule counseling but need to figure that out with timing myself um but yeah i'm just like getting on top of things slowly but surely yeah pretty okay day today pretty calm stayed inside the house um did an application it felt great it was really exciting um i'm ready to just do incredibly well in the future spoke to my friend [inaudible] spoke to in couple of day and it was awesome spoke to another friend um who wants to include me on project that he starting i'm just really excited things are gonna go really well this semester i'm just ready to jump in have to wake up early tomorrow which are terrible but it will be happening today was really just me by myself and like that like to be alone pretty great day today um hung out with some of my high-school friends felt awesome um you know they remind me of the self that used to be that liked lot more and i'm just feeling lot more driven at home um so i'm ready to bring this all back to harvard and do really well and i'm really looking to branch out from the friends group that had made because although they is safe space um think i've clung too much to they and really need to branch out and make more friends that is more driven and ready to do greater things um so i'm ready for that and i'm just so excited also spoke to some of my other friends one of my friends who goes to brown um spoke to me bit about just how stressed they was for next semester and how well they did this semester and we relate on on different level just because lot of my friends because of my high school think um my college preparatory school um they find what they're doing is easy um and me maybe they because they're ivy leagues or just the type of school that we're going to we're definitely struggling bit more in that this classes is really hard and there not lot of support um academic support should say um but we're working hard and we're getting grades that we're not used to getting and that something new um for both of me in terms of yes the number um but also what that means um in high school you know you see that they low and you get they up quickly rapidly in in college you get the grades once and that they and they final absolutely um and that kind of scary because everything means lot um and you don't know your teachers and you can't quite connect with them and and and maybe you know shimmy your grades up bit not that we did that but things was lot closer before um in terms of relationships um with peers with teachers deans of students and things like that so um that just something that we was talking about and said you know make sure you don't lock yourself in your room next semester and they said um no like think might have to and said you know part of this is yes we have to do well in school like we have to get good grades um but because of the school that we're going to my endeavors is little bit different in that grades is not the only things that matter and we have to network and put as much effort into networking as we do in making sure that my grades is good um because at the end of the day number can get you places but knowing people get you farther um so we just spoke about that bit and um yeah and that was really awesome and then spoke to my other friends about making um sort of like little company sort of things that planning they like some album guess to represent the diversity at harvard but we're planning to make that donations to uh some foundations so was invited to work on that meeting so could do developer i'm excited but that also sort of awakened um my sense of urgency in terms of making more friends making better friends making friends that inspire me and help me do well and but yeah so they been really great day think pretty awesome day today um so last night we drove to washington dc my mom dad and um to come to your program through the iop and the uh um office of career services um to visit cnn and npr um so that why didn't get to do my audio survey last night 'cause wasn't alone and couldn't get alone 'cause we were stuck in car um but had great day today um went to this program with about 13 or 12 other students and sat at cnn and npr were so exhausting didn't get lot of sleep in the car um and some things were really interesting and it were really amazing to see the different um environments and and cultures of both of this organizations that really sort of aim to do the same things through different means um which is journalism and and sharing information um also hung out with some really cool kids that were so different from me but we had great conversations over sushi and we just hung out and chilled and it were really amazing um which is completely awesome and uh yeah so now i'm going to bed 'cause have to wake up really early um to make 730 train um but yeah i'm really happy with today and don't know how feel about my career i'm not sure wanna career in journalism but politics yes but i'm really glad came um yeah feel like made good decision today um pretty relaxed day today was on bus for eight hours then train for another hours and half um so that was really the whole day but my parents was happy to see me which was great so was my kitty um and we got some food and today felt today felt really well was really grateful to have the opportunity to reflect on yesterday and also get started on my book um and just figuring out what stories wanna include and as started writing realized that i'm not really some exceptional writer um but hope to become that and hope that my stories um could make me [inaudible] important messages so that exciting um was also contacted by my friend um he says we need to chop usually what that means is to have conversations that not serious but just li well serious yes but in terms of like my future advice sort of thing so um i'm glad he can look to me um for that because often feel like i'm just taking and not giving from to him which is unfortunate but i'm working on it and working on confidence and and loving myself and understanding that am enough so um i'm working on that perspective on my friendship um but other than that yeah really just sat on bus and then train but it was nice it was really nice to have time to reflect pretty good day today um didn't feel very well feeling sort of nauseous and carsick all the time probably still recovering from the car ride um got some work done spoke with my friend about courses and getting closer with this friend in good way um this is guy friend that i've been friend with for while and talking on the phone lot or just um yeah um and had some good conversations with my mom today i'm feeling ready for school basically have my classes picked out um and i'm just so excited to start and i'm moving in tomorrow [inaudible] interview um on monday two interview hopefully on monday and then from there um let see yeah then i'll be at some assertive program on tuesday so i'm just really getting into things um haven't started reading my econ book which was something that wanted to do but did read other book and and sort of got some of that stuff done in terms of broadening my vocabulary and preparing myself to have discussions about important political topics listening to things and yeah and getting some good rest so i'm really excited to go back um pretty great day today um moved in so am back at school back at [redacted] um really excited um have an interview tomorrow potentially another one um as well tomorrow if not tuesday um but i'm hoping to get an work done spoke to my friends over skype um an of my friends am here which is great um we spoke about social relationships and blocking and how that already bringing up an tension um so that was interesting to take look at uh let see yeah just like it pretty difficult because now you know i've created this friends group that like i'm not sure if like the self that am within that friends group um but definitely there is group feel comfortable with would want to block with them i'm not quite sure and so that have me little bit nervous um so yeah feel like i'm getting more comfortable with the other set of friends that i've made um and like my [redacted] and think they're helping me and they're elevating me instead of you know taking me down um so that just something that on my mind but right now i'm just getting sleep get ready for my interview tomorrow and just really being prepared to do well and really succeed and have my single so moved in i'm feeling pretty set and i'm feeling very determined to just get great grades do well here academically and socially and just really get everything together pretty great day today had two interviews um the first one um got the job um she offered it to me right there said i'd get back to her um and then my uh second interviews think went well she was little bit tough um but think it went pretty well um so that something that have to grapple with in terms of um both of these opportunities are extremely important and will really help me in my future um with the experience that they'd be able to give me however if was to do something wanna do it well um and so definitely have to take into account you know what i'm able to do and remind myself that missed it at first so that something that i've been stressed with in that wanna do so incredibly well here um and really wanna be like that girl that doing amazing and and are amazing and have amazing things or maybe not have amazing things but are an amazing person and are doing amazing things um so it just hard to balance everything and sort of make that decision for yourself um but felt little proud of myself today which was good um and have to keep moving forward with that and then did see my parents today that was good i'm definitely trying to stay more connected with her as i'm at school just to get help from her with keeping me on track and things um yeah getting much more organized using an agenda um hoping to get started on homework tomorrow um to get ahead of schedule and set up meeting at the bureau of study counsel to get things cracking so i'm excited very very excited pretty relaxed day today um didn't eat very healthily which wasn't good um something wanted to uh work on as got back but i'm staying on track working out in the morning tomorrow waking up early getting some work done starting my school work tomorrow and then yeah still little stressed about classes in terms of which ones to take um but yeah also saw some friends today and hung out with them for bit that was fun um that friends they're just two people who are in relationship so kind of felt like third-wheeling but it okay um started my program today on opportunities in education super super excited think it gonna be awesome and i'm really happy um that decided to jump in have some interview tomorrow that i'm bit nervous for it for the summer really hope get it 'cause that would be absolutely amazing um but yeah just sort of ready to tackle everything and um today told um ones people that didn't want the job that it offered me and it was sort of just like well let me know when you know your schedule so we can work something out which means that it want me um which are awesome that good feeling um but need to make sure that can do it and then be student first and do well here um so i'm really stressed about that but yeah no that about it just pretty chill day watched some comedy stuff but i'm ready for bed now pretty good day today um woke up early and went to the gym um did laundry and did some econ homework during then uh and then went to my program came back finished laundry um went to dinner saw some people that hadn't seen which was really exciting um and then went to my room spoke on the phone to my friend and asked him about some struggles i'm having with extracurriculars and committing myself to certain ones that um really require lot of work um that was really incredible experience um and that had little bit of time to prep for some interview then did the interview and it was really exciting something that really love to do um you know as sat through the interview more realized how much really wanted that um and you know maybe leaving technology behind isn't the best um idea but do want to enjoy my life and enjoy my life so wanna do something that love and don't know if cs will bring me there um but i'm hoping to do something incredible to be something incredible so right now i'm just sort of applying to everything and that why i've had so many interview think um but i'm hoping things go well and it not like i'm stressed about extracurriculars quite yet but know wanna do something great and that that puts pressure on it right now um but wouldn't equate that to stress um but yeah so today i'd say was mostly relaxed just lot of subconscious thinking about um the future which is why called my friend and asked him to give me some insight and his perspective on the issue pretty good day today um not as productive as i'd hoped to be in terms of doing econ work but i'm really tired now but did do lot of my program today i'm pretty happy with it and um got contacted by um one of the places interviewed for made it to the final round so that exciting um and just spoke to my parents saw my mom and dad saw my dad today actually um yeah just know school coming it like right around the corner literally um and hope can stay on my own track and that gonna be really big for me and think can do it i've just really gotta focus um on my my end goal not my now need to be thinking ahead but i'm so excited and i'm really excited to see my friends um little nervous about housing um don't think want to live with the friends that i've made um so that bit of struggle but i'm excited [inaudible] just really wanna sleep pretty good day today um woke up in the morning went to my program that early to go to my last um site visit which is really really great um and then from there came back home after long bus ride um did some preparation for the semester which starts monday um put important dates on my calendar um set up all of my binders and things um so i'm really excited nervous ready to do exceptionally well um yeah today felt pretty relaxed i'd say was pretty happy spent lot of time with this one girl who lives in [redacted] uh and she white um which is not good or bad things like in the normal context but because most of the friends i've made is is black um i'm happy that was able to um build relationship um with someone who doesn't look like me because that what i'm used to on that home um so that was not exciting but um important and then uh after dinner with my dad then went to [redacted] basement and made some posters with some girl um which was also fantastic so yeah today was like pretty good day really liked it actually really great day today got to see all of my friends um which was fantastic um got to get some really good quality time in with my friends um that spoke to over the phone lot almost every day over the break and uh just really connected with we was able to just you know vibe sit there listen to music talk he was talking to me about his ideas for the crimson um which is newspaper and just like we was just chilling which was good um saw some other friends had little bit of not tension but did feel little bit uneasy um at some points just you know and some comments about like them not seeing me over the semester and me being dedicated to my work essentially was just like um overly curious of other friendships that have um and little bit critical so that was that um then had another friends come over and um he basically just said like can come over and bother you for sec and was like sure you know i'm i'm usually always open for emotional support um when people need it just you know to help them out because know what it feel like to not have any outlet for that um so it went well he came over he just sort of talk about this existential crisis he having with being in liminal space yet he he wouldn't explain in between like where the threshold lied guess and the states that he was jumping in between and with them it was sort of tricky because couple of people have told me that he interested in me in as more than friends but don't think he is um so was wondering if he was trying to get something like that off of his chest and just wasn't able to do it um but yeah so was just dealing with that but yeah that about it don't really know what to think of that situation i'm not interested in them like that um but i'm always willing to be friends and to be good friends to anyone who need it so that what am just going by but yeah pretty good day today um went to brunch with my friends saw lot of them connected with them saw some great people that hadn't seen in while which was fantastic um it reminded myself of all the relationships i'd like to have and and strengthen um did some homework today which was great it was not due but um i'd like to get ahead um on top of that um just had some good conversations with my friends met with my [path] um and she helped me you know she shed some light on um my workload and and what that gonna look like and if working is good idea um and yeah just like little bit stressed about couple of my relationships with my friends that kind of felt different today but that may just be um me overthinking things as usual um but i'm definitely starting to get little stressed um feeling that chest pains again but watch to make sure that do very well this semester and that i'm happy so will be actively um trying to ensure that this relationships don't have such great impact on my school work or how carry myself and um how just make decisions um so i'm just i'm excited for this semester really really want to do well which is huge um and know how important it is so i'm i'm really ready to dive in i'm gonna hope things turn out well pretty okay day today had my first classes um like them had conversation with my friend today about like concentration what we wanna be and stuff and left feeling really stressed um knowing that have no idea what wanna do what wanna concentrate in and i'm constantly going towards this thing of trying to fulfill my parent ideal uh me and have job that secures financial independence um but not quite so much fulfillment and really need to change that mindset um but also need to get my life together because there nobody that gonna tell me to do it and there not gonna be moment where i'm like oh guess should do this now like it need to happen and need to be proactive about it so um that what i'm hoping to do guess but yeah just realized like i'm feeling behind which hate that feeling then spent some time with my usual group of girlfriends um and that was good feel better about the situation in housing and was little bit distracted with them but you know keep it in in short sprints we'll be all right today was not good day um like nothing bad happened but um as the day went on felt worse and worse about myself um and sort of not knowing what wanna do feeling unprepared um not of caliber um compared to my other classmates and um just in general even if was at regular school um and that makes me sad um it very different from my [inaudible] it sounds terrible but like used to like overachieving or like being that girl um and don't know how to do that here and so that something that has been sort of eating away at me um and so today met with um bureau of study counselor um also met with my advisor and just really realized like don't wanna do computer science whatsoever at all and i'm only doing it because think should be and then realized that i've been doing that my whole life and that i've been untrue to myself and now am feeling the repercussions of that decision um and they're not great and actually feel terrible 'cause i'm behind um don't know what to do with myself i'm not well versed in what i'm interested in because barely know what i'm interested in um and essentially just feel like am child um and i'm immature because always needed structure and didn't quite do things on my own guess you could say when it came to what wanted to do and what felt was my mission or my in-internal compass um and so that was really bothering me and told my dad about it and we walked around and talked about it and had some grub um but yeah so that really how my day went and it just sort of been like weighing down on my shoulders um and it probably will for couple of day probably won't see anyone like that many people for couple of day or just interact as much um do like having single gives me the space to just be here and um wallow really um and hope that that space you know instead of having negative impact on me and allowing me to dwell on my emotions and and self-pity um it'll gives me time to reflect and focus and and grow in terms of creating mental space um for discovering who am and what wanna do and unfortunately don't think can rush finding my mission but don't has time and don't want more time yeah i'm just hoping that i'm enough for people for myself for my future um and i'm starting to feel like i'm unlovable as well don't really know where that came from but that definitely happening so yeah pretty good day today um actually no that lie it was an okay day today um went to um cans today which is mental health services um and had my first meeting um i'm not quite sure how feel about it think um therapy is very interesting because you don't come out of one or two meeting and just have all the solutions to your problems um lot of it is really just getting it out of your system and speaking it into existence so you cans actively work against it um so um that was tricky for me just in like spilling lot of information it emotionally exhausting um and it makes you think about these things and usually when have to do that get little down for the rest of the day um and it not intentionally i'm not quite sure why but it definitely do happen and it definitely did today um um but i'm okay and uh one of my friends really picked up on it um when he saw me um and said had to go um was sad was going to huhs and he was like why is you going again um and guess yesterday said have to go to huhs like i'm bored or something um which didn't know said but um yeah so he sort of caught on that i've been going lot and he told me to tell him what wrong and eventually told him that was going to get counseling um and he said why didn't you tell me and said that didn't wanna put that baggage on him 'cause it wasn't fair to him um he didn't really like that argument or understand it but um think one day he will and that okay um right now and then also hung out with another friends today who don't usually hang out with absolutely loved it it was so fun um we got lunch just chilled um wish we could be in more group settings together um which think we will soon and i'm just really happy got to spend an time with her um yeah didn't see my usual group of girlfriends today though but that okay pretty um okay day still feeling little bit down um spoke to my friend again today um and he just told me that need to not put stress on myself as usual um and um that in doing this i'm [inaudible] me and very inside of myself and it not good um and it not on purpose and it so against what usually do um so it was interesting to hear and something i've been thinking about little bit i'm not mad at him for the comment and don't know if should be but am thinking about it lot and then i'm just hoping could just like really recuperate and get better 'cause it like feel like my brain is sick think it like down and every time i'm in this room in this bed or like someone brings out that he love their classes or he love what they're doing it like bullet and it like really really bothering me because i'm not feeling the same way and all i'm trying to do is feel happy all wanted to do in getting here is be happy and i'm not achieving that and constantly negotiating with what want um and that is not what should be doing but know i'm gonna do it anyways and yeah guess just wish could be as put together um as i'd like to be and know lot of this is like imposter syndrome where people feeling like everybody else is doing well but then and to some extent sure that isn't the case people put up facades obviously safety reasons however part of it is true and know i'm behind in what i'm doing i'm gonna hate myself for that but can't go back in time and can't change the way came up and how deal with emotions unfortunately um so i'm just sort of giving myself couple day to really um just sort of be in myself and really hear everything that i'm telling the little girl in my heart um what was done wrong and what you can change and what you wish you had and it not healthy to do that but think if don't do it then um it'll just keep sitting there and keep growing but really really wanna just like get better and wanna be done with this feeling um so i'm trying to actively you know find what do like um and move forward with that but it is so hard um because just wanna be happy so yeah um today was pretty good felt okay was happy with my classes and things um felt fine fem felt positive um and another day [where i've got] later and felt little more sad and um was by myself then hung out with guy friend of mine and i'm not sure if there correlation with me feeling sad being after he leaves or just that it happens to be at late hours um but that things that been happening and now might have to call my other friend who is not upset with me but just um unhappy with um me in terms of staying in touch with him and responding to his phone call and and text messages um in comparison to the other friend and yeah so that something that have to deal with and have to take accountability for and and it not something that i've done on purpose but um i'm just like don't really know what going on with me i'm just like sad and just lied on my floor for while and didn't sleep didn't cry just like sat there numb hearing my brain so decided to write wrote terrible poem um but nevertheless it poem and i'm not sure if it helping me or not but it kind of felt good it almost distracted me so think i'm gonna try to keep doing that um but yeah [inaudible] do that so well pretty good um day today not terrible got some work done finished one of my applications went to party danced with couple of people had some interesting interactions um the last interactions with the people that usually am interacting at dances and maybe that was for the better um and was of course sort of like jealous when he danced with other people which isn't good 'cause we're not in relationship we're just friends but it was like don't know but uh now yeah i'm sort of ready to go to bed knowing that have other interests that can pursue um and got into class today that i'm really excited for so i'm gonna do that the class wasn't math and had thought um it gonna be really hard to tell my mom about that because thought she was really for me concentrating on economics and getting job but she seems to not care at all and she didn't understand how concentrating on economics would get me job anyways so it just like really liberating um which is awesome so now i'm taking more class that like and i'm just really happy about it but yeah um pretty okay day today went to church this morning it was like sudden impulse it was like 1023 or something and the thing started at 1100 and was like i'm ready i'm ready to be awakened so got up and got dressed as fast as can and ran uh no walked really fast let me not lie walked to the train and saw friend there got to church really liked the church i'm gonna go back i've been sort of questioning religion lot um because my parents was of two different faiths um but really felt happy sitting there and inspired and felt like was learning which was really good um and so that happened then saw my friend um same guy friend that usually see after at brunch um and asked him couple of questions about the party last night which was fine and then um when told him that went to church he wasn't mad he was like playful mad um and was just like why wouldn't you tell me um like would have like gotten up and and gone with you or like this is everything that talk about with you and so when you go you don't tell me um and really felt terrible about that um because it true and like most of the reason that did start was really him because he really embodied religion or christianity felt and wanted to be in that same light um and didn't really think about it because was so impulsive this morning but i'm very bad best friend i'm very bad best friend um just sort of felt really uh yucky about it um and tried to talk to him about it there like what happened at church and stuff and he was like yeah that good but like realize don't know when to tell people thing and when to not tell people thing um but i'll probably send him message tonight just to say thank you for everything um but yeah and then hung out with him some more went to the bookstore with him to get his books for classes and he said this couple times he said do you ever love someone so much you hate him and like we was like kinda like play fighting the whole times like pushing and and shoving and like saying hate you and was like yeah and we just like had like little moment which is interesting and then we went to his room and did some work then went to meeting for sorority that not sorority anymore um and that was really nice just like talking it was like final round so it was kinda weird 'cause they're kinda testing you but also just having conversation with you which is really weird but um yeah and then went and did homework started it way too late have so much reading uh and won't be able to finish it tonight but i'm gonna try my very best and yeah 'cause need to wake up early as well basically don't know how to say no to my friend still but we're working on it but yeah um i've just been really busy today just reading getting ahead not even getting ahead catching up on work um probably getting sick from staying up late too often but um yeah everything was fine and then came went to lacrosse which was fun nerve-wracking but good experience um and then uh sort of came home to lot of drama that had been going on in the background about me um and somebody who expressed that they liked me um friend that expressed that they liked me um and had feelings that did not have and that was really frustrating to see um because one was talking about they to my best friend and my best friend didn't say anything to me um and they was because they was like protecting him and like abiding by his wishes which guess shows me how good of friend that they are um but was just sort of like torn you know and um need to figure out how to balance different friend groups better um but also need to learn how to respond to text messages and that problem that have that are continuous um and really need to get on they because they starting to cause issues and don't wanna lose the friend that have and i'm seeing like they already don't have respect for me after this incident so i'm just really stressed now wasn't was just stressed about school and catching up and now i'm like really frustrated not frustrated disappointed um pretty good day today was able to be pretty productive um had little bit of an incident with my friend um and things are okay didn't see my normal group um but had really interesting class today that i'm really excited for think it'll challenge me um and i'm excited to learn also got into social club today which was very exciting um and that sort of celebration um was exciting and um knew exactly who wanted to tell as soon as it happened which was awesome and yeah it was just like good guess um met counselor today spoke about lot about my issues um yeah don't really know when i'm gonna tell my friend um sort of what going on and if they're willing to help what it could help me with but that gotta happen pretty soon but other than that today was pretty good was pretty distraught after the meeting as usually are but um i'm okay now just really really have to go to bed pretty great day today would say um got accepted to [redacted] formerly [redacted] um now [redacted] has [redacted] because of sanctions i'm so happy um was really nervous and there was point in the day where really wasn't sure if it was something that wanted um but went to the events and um just realized that like these are normal girls like normal kids and like friends that wanna make and perhaps some experiences that wanna has um it was talking about lot of like things about sex and drinking and it was drinking and it like i've never done that and i've never really had the urge and was able to say no but do think it something that sort of has to do or might i'm not quite sure yet but yeah there are that had paper due at 1200 today it was like three-page response nothing serious but um handed it in at 500 yep and that was rough but yeah did all the reading for it feeling behind schedule so exhausted only got like four hours of sleep last night so we're struggling but yeah i'm just so ready to go to bed pretty all right day today really tired just wanted to do work um met my friend went over the set with me and that ended up turning into another conversation yet again about my relationship as friend and him having feelings for me and not wanting that to change things and blah blah blah and really i'm just trying to be really productive and find it really difficult to do so here mainly 'cause i'm always surrounded by friend and occasionally it bit frustrating because wanna do really well but at the same know can't quite be successful here in locking myself in my room and that do like when can look back at the day and say yes got work done and i've been productive when i'm not sure i've been able to do that as much as would like to um other than that i've been trying to take shower for the past day and half and haven't and feel disgusting um and yeah i'm just like also craving men right now but i'm also on my period so that that um yeah i'm just like really tired i'm tired i'm going to bed late i'm tired of going to bed feelings like should have done more and i'm just like really over it so yeah pretty great day today um was really busy didn't get to do lot of work um but did lot of stuff for my sorority thing that not sorority but is sorority um which was good help me make more friends which is important um also um got lot of emails for interviews also got into program at the iop um so i'm really excited about that um feel like i'll be doing thing on campus this semester i'm also doing the crimson which i'm so excited for um and i'm just like i'm really happy um and hope that thing go well um but yeah i'm just living breathing should have gone to bed like an hour ago but you know doing emails the work never ends but am struggling with making sure i'm doing homework because know [really] need to before fall behind in my classes but yeah um today started pretty well was busy um running back and forth between conferences and interviews um asked group of my friends to go get berryline tonight which was like ice cream or whatever um and that ended up hurting me lot more than it was helping me thought that it would help me um instead realized that some tension with my friends has sort of culminated into something larger that perhaps they're not recognizing but could definitely feel um and felt like some outsider in group that had called my family um for the past three-plus months um so that was would say intimidating um for sure because had lot of faith um in not only my friends but the process of making friends here um and thought these ones was here to stay and perhaps was wrong perhaps i'm overreacting can't rea quite give some answer at these moment however um do feel like i'm sort of experiencing loss already and think was expecting it to happen um after these person sort of came into my friendship group my friends group and messed things up with expressing interest and then talking to my friends about me that friends not telling me what going on like things like that um and i'm very sad about it and if lose that friends really only has two friends which is so so sad um but i'm glad i'm part of the sorority now maybe these is what need maybe these is learning experience don't quite know um but i'm sad for sure am sad about it um pretty good day today had two interviews one got there decided didn't wanna do it um and had training from 1000 to 200 which was really fun i'm really excited i'm gonna be student groups liaison for [redacted] former uh mayor of minneapolis i'm just like really excited think this is gonna be great opportunity um and so hope that do really well and succeed and hope that get this other things that i'm applying for as well um but yeah i'm i'm really excited this is gonna be really really busy year or semester but think it will be well worth it um friendships i'm stressed feel like i've lost one of my best friends but that okay well it not okay but like i'm getting through the friends who feel sort of um played large role in the destruction of that friendships and [inaudible] came over and you know said he really didn't wanna do that and that it wasn't his intention or something like he would continue to do um but told him to just do whatever makes him happy um and to just sort of build home here and if that means being friends with my friends that fine because it not binary situation in which only he can be friends with him or can um but it do makes things different [inaudible] quick however i'm not mad at him think i'm just mad at the situation and there nothing can do about it miss my friends of course but like it is what it is pretty good day today i'm super tired just like fell asleep for think it could have been like 10 minutes really don't know um but my body have been so tired yeah i've been fighting it so now i'm just listening and really just going to bed um mostly just got reading done um for today which was nice uh feeling good have to make calendar tomorrow before get to my meeting about my calendar um so that unfortunate but that gonna happen and yeah i'm just like really really tired and need to start getting more sleep and figuring out how to do that hmm [inaudible] that was really it really just did notes on my homework didn't really see lot of friends at all actually not good at that pretty gloomy day today um not only am getting pimples on my face but um feel like sorta missed out on hanging out with my friends today didn't really see anyone um and didn't get as much work done as wanted to so that was just like double whammy um and guess tomorrow will be doing the same thing except will be getting work done um so i'm just sort of getting used to not seeing my friends as often know saw them way too often last semester so i'm just trying to figure out the happy balance and with being happy and being [inaudible] feeling comfortable um also i'm like trying to go to bed earlier and stuff totally not working having trouble focusing staying on task get sad really wanna use my phone so just take it which is terrible um yeah i'm just wondering [when get] done mess feeling very negative right now hopefully tomorrow will be better but don't really know just felt like don't have fear of missing out just hate missing out and feel like that always happens so don't really know what to do about that other than that like genuinely did not see human being today other than walking into [redacted] for like 10 minutes tops or seeing people in class that it so yeah it it was struggle today today has been work work work work work rush rush rush rush rush here there and everywhere had no time to do homework i'm so tired i'm not getting sleep face is breaking out i'm hungry don't even has time to eat and just like it don't know what i'm doing don't know what going on but like need sleep can't afford to has my face be breaking out right now want to do homework and be done at godly hour and go to bed at least wanna go to bed with my homework done and don't even think can do that i'm not frustrated i'm just so tired like wish that just had enough time in the day for these things or that knew what was doing so wouldn't end up like these i'm just like i'm so tired but got initiated today for fleur-de-lis which is for my [redacted] um and there was no sanctions for it so that was really really exciting um it was good moment wanted to feel confident in myself but had these huge pimple on my face so could only feel so much just don't like the way look right now at all like my face is just dying um went to mental health services today for my appointment once again i'm putting lot of pressure on myself need to just relax stop thinking about things i'm pretty sure has an ear infection and it killing me but don't has time to go to the doctor am so nauseous and my ear hurts my ear hurts actually so don't know what to do there either super busy day today um but felt pretty productive had to do some last-minute preparation and studying for some interview that had but it went well did well in my class today my seminar with the law professor was really happy about um saw some friends um not really loving the interactions i've been having with my friends constantly feel like some outsider um which is super unfortunate um and hate that feeling because know these people was my friends at one point and i'm wondering what sort of going on but also know that it have their own lives as well and i'm not their only friends and perhaps need to do the same thing that they've been doing um so which have um but yeah it just been kind of sad to realize makes me little bit nervous about blocking because i've said i'm gonna block with them already and i'm like pretty keen on it but um if it don't like me by the time that comes it gonna be really awkward and there also um yesterday my friends asked me if like these guy and you know said yes um but like the timing was sorta messed up and she asked if she could like pursue them and didn't really know what to say so she saw me in people today and asked didn't say no but was like like uncomfortable with it and like really wanna pursue them but at the same time know don't know how to do that um so we'll see but yeah so that just like super unfortunate and yeah am like really liking my academic self right now struggling with my social self um if have any friends if will have any friends if i'm just gonna be that girl that always doing something um and if that good or bad thing so don't know i'm little sad i'm actually quite sad but haven't had time to think about it yet so i'm going to bed 'cause don't want to feel emotions ever so yeah pretty okay day today um woke up meeting went to class had another meeting um then did little bit of work had an interview then did an more work and then hung out with an friends which was really exciting and it felt really good um one 'cause hadn't really hung out with them all week so it was good to see um them and it was just one friends um the friends that was most worried about losing um but things are good which are great and um yeah it was great ending to my day um i'm feeling better now um there lot of uh tension not tension there lot of questioning that needs to happen in terms of who my friends are and who i'm friends with in front of other people um and sort of what friends have considered good friends that have sort of been sabotaging other friendships um the friends that spoke to today that was worried about losing um we went to felipe after whatever and she was like you know rennie said that we call the my group of friends hello and this kid told the girl that just went out to felipe with that he felt that hello was saying goodbye and he said that said that and so didn't say that exactly didn't say hello was saying goodbye um but said you know think it may um leave me soon or like may fall out of that group unfortunately um and he he said that to someone else which was not great um and he didn't even say it to the girl that went to um felipe with he said it to another girl in my group and then that girl told the girl told who the girl went to felipe with then she told me and it just like what are this guys doing like come on it just it was just too much and like he said that like he considered me like his best friends and that like it just the terms best friends have sort of been tainted for me in that don't even know what best friends looks like on college campus um which are super worrisome because think i've really defined my my people my happiness my relationships as like friendships and best friends um and that hard to deal with here but it definitely happening um other than that um it was sorta busy today but did feel sorta productive i'm hoping to be really productive tomorrow and go out tomorrow night maybe and then sunday go to church and do work um but i'm happy that today was uh it ended nicely pretty good day today would say am got into [redacted] which is like really big deal and so was really happy about that um sort of like woke up at like 600 which is equivalent to the middle of the night at this point in my life um and saw the email and was like happy remember laughing and then going back to bed um and then waking up to go again um but yeah so like that was fun was just training all day 1000 to 230 then something at 300 until 500 so [inaudible] really didn't get lot of time to do lot of homework um and also my eye got like really red all of sudden so came back from [redacted] um or urgent care like maybe 20-something minutes ago um oh that was really frustrating had very frustrating experience just because like it was really long wait and was anxious and really wanted to be doing homework but couldn't um [i think] i'm okay and yeah found out that um somebody else is blocking with us and didn't know and the person who blocking with us is the guy that has expressed interest in us um and that like we're not moving forward or anything 'cause like don't find him attractive or like not even that i'm just not attracted to him um so like that that little bit unfortunate quite unfortunate actually um yes that was interesting to to hear about guess by mistake which is awesome um and the other girls in the group it it know about the situation so it was just really interesting how everything playing out but you know keep telling myself i'm not just not gonna be home lot and i'm just gonna be busy which is true am going to make myself busy um but yeah other than that it really busy day same thing tomorrow so we'll see what happens long day today um still didn't do as much work as had hoped had more training today had presentation in the training that had like 45 minutes to prep for was super nervous um and not even because people was there but because like one of the people that consider very good friend and that what makes me the most nervous don't really like my closest friend to see my academic endeavors because i'm afraid like they won't be enough um and so that was unfortunate and don't think did very well but that okay um got aside my case study for and this training is all for an extracurricular that got into um they like big deal like me haven't gone to the gym in like week and can feel myself getting fat um so need to go but feel like don't have time um but i'm not gonna let last semester happen again so we will be making time for the gym feel so tired for did not get enough sleep but there no time for that um let see other things that happened today super stressful situation with blocking um had thought that we had already set my blocking group uh which is about six of me then um in an group chat this don't know one of my friend um decided or yeah one of them decided that we would be adding this new people in who guy and this guy is guy who expressed interest in me that don't like as as significant other like they an okay people like they good people like them as friend um and didn't know so that was new information that figured out like yesterday or something but then today also realized that that addition to my group wasn't so much of an addition as they was swap and they cut out another friend um and that was hard because as one of the girls in the group that i'm blocking with was texting the other girls saying like no um we sort of set up blocking group was in the same exact room with the other girls and so like they was very very weird and had to like not look at my phone because didn't wanna see any text messages that they could have been sending um they was just so stressful [inaudible] having [inaudible] just decided to have everyone so like both of the people that instead of swapping them we're just keeping both of them and am not happy about they have to say not happy um but feel like don't really have input mean do have input but they not worth my time so yeah now i'm just ready to go to bed do work in the school kid let me just do school really well you know so that what i'm gonna do pretty okay day today i'm sure tired um woke up early for doctor appointment and had like meetings where was running back and forth and just tried to do homework [inaudible] today um feeling accomplished i've finished homework for class that have due thursday so tomorrow i'm hoping to study for econ um things i've sort of been pushing back and then also i've got some work from one of my extracurriculars um the things are sort of piling up so think getting ahead are really good i'm glad i'm doing it um let see yeah mean i'm excited for this semester like i'm feeling like i'm really being productive um had to watch the [inaudible] videos today because felt like didn't know what was doing um and that ended up being actually really helpful i'm glad did that but i'm just so exhausted also went to meetings today that um composed of lot of black harvard just about like making the community more inclusive um [some tea] spilt um but yeah lot of good discussion healthy discussion so [inaudible] much but it learning experience i'm hoping to become bigger person on campus so i'm excited for that um but yeah um today did not do lot of work um which is scary um but did stay up really late because something due tomorrow at 500 for um hccg one of my extracurriculars don't think did it well don't think did it right but it was also my first time and we're learning so um hopefully things will be okay and i'm willing to work on it again until get it right am also um have something due at o'clock tomorrow so that is something need to get on and yeah

abroad over the summer um so i'm really really hoping do well there and yeah just really want to get good rest i'm worried about my exam on wednesday that don't know if i'm prepared for for econ but you know it it happening thing is coming and going um so yeah i'm just preparing myself just really want to go to bed um have been productive feeling like maybe there just aren't enough hours in the days pretty okay day today um my friends got into some programs for studying abroad which didn't even know about didn't even know it was on the table so that was something that was really sad 'cause think it would've been something that would've loved to do um and unfortunately didn't know about the opportunity um which is really really unfortunate but can't really change that i'm worried about summer opportunity and hope things go really well um i'm just like super nervous about it 'cause really really really really really want to do something incredible you know and it lot of pressure to put on myself especially as freshman but kinda don't care um and have high expectations from myself and and think that worked for me um so yeah i'm just really worried about summer opportunity just wanna do something incredible something important um but yeah it really all that been on my mind just did lot of work on my [p-set] today um thursdays is my busiest day had some interview at 940 classroom 1000 to 1100 another classroom 1200 to 100 don't know 211 class 1100 to 1200 another class 100 to 300 had to be at study group for 415 for what do at the [redacted] um and that one till 545 then had to have meeting for the [redacted] at 700 and then worked on finishing the [p-set] and sort of like had the answers but wanted to do it and understand it uh so that what just spent the past like three hours doing um and so didn't do any other homework which is super disappointing but um yeah hopefully things get better pretty okay day today again this pattern of not getting as much work done as had hoped um went to class had meeting after that did work i've been struggling with one of my essays um have like three essays to do which is just so exciting and all 480-something pages of the book to read um so i'm really struggling with coursework and just staying on top of things been getting ahead it was okay now i'm not so need to figure that out again um let see and yeah had banquet tonight also went to party and um yeah so just like met lot of people partied with different types of people different people don't usually hang out with so that was exciting the experience different types of uh uh but yeah i'm just living i'm super tired but i'm going to try to read in bed before go to bed and yeah well also shopped today lot um today spent most of my time by myself was doing homework struggling with paper reading book um yeah again not getting the work that need to get done accomplished um struggling with time struggling with focusing uh which is huge issue need to figure it out but yeah i'm just like tired i'm gonna read before go to bed try to go to church in the morning so yeah absolutely exhausted um so much work to do paper do at o'clock tomorrow haven't even finished reading for it have to study for econ just like this is just terrible and i'm just so exhausted need to sleep um there just way too much on my plate right now tired like my eyes is burning like it took me like 15 minutes to read like page and half because the words were like getting blurry and stuff so really need to figure out my life and get my life together but i'm ready to go to bed now and it'd be done um today was busy woke up finished reading wrote response paper that was due at 400 got it done by like 1130 um then went to training that was from oh no maybe got it done at 1200 or something then went to training that was from 100 to 330 went to record music video from 330 to like 500 something then at 800 went to meeting from 600 to 830 then 630 to 830 excuse me and then went to the study session from 745 or 800 to 930 then did my homework where had slide to make for [accg] which is lot of research essentially and then did some no yeah that uh super unfortunate terrible time management and then am behind and have another paper due on wednesday at 1200 but also have some exam on wednesday so we're [welding] lot and i'm so stressed but also need to sleep and i'm supposed to be reading this thing right now but think i'm going to read it so can fall asleep and then wake up ready and go print to do homework that due tomorrow at 10 o'clock um that couldn't do because don't have printer because i'm not paying um even though tomorrow will have to pay despite the fact that am broke um let me think yeah so will be cramming for the next three days um absolutely and it gonna be such some experience hate this schedule right now um but also feels really productive so don't know what to do with my life essentially super tired once again um lots of work to do have to finish in the morning and wash it up but that what it is [inaudible] first today saw some friends that don't usually hang out with one on one or whatever but like really liked being with them which was awesome so that gonna help me in terms of making new friends um yeah just tired and can like barely keep my eyes open which is why i'm going to bed and was gonna read but it just not the information is not remaining in my head so yeah i'm just ready to sleep um really just like studied and did homework today had two meetings in class and that was it didn't have lunch not having three meals day anymore which is don't know is okay guess but not something love but feel like am gaining weight so it may be good that i'm not eating don't know um today was was okay it was beautiful outside so felt happy in the morning did work went to see my counselor and then went to class and studied then took my econ exam don't feel good about it at all feel like study for that class and it don't do anything so i'm really frustrated um and don't know how to fix anything so i'm really upset about that but am just moving forward not thinking about it being done um yeah so i'm just like you know i've cut econ out for good and i'm going to bed early because like my eyes hurt and haven't been getting enough sleep um and totally have work to do have an entire op-ed to write for the crimson due tomorrow at 700 have started absolutely not so i'll be getting at least six six and half hours of sleep tonight because i've only been getting like five something which is terrible um so could wake up early do work but yeah so have to go because thursdays have absolutely no time to do anything so yeah i'm exhausted and disappointed in myself really tired ready to go to bed wanted to read two chapters for econ only got through one it was so long it was like 20 or 30 pages um of text but so that was unfortunate and also had to take shower just 'cause really needed to shower super stressful day had lot of work working before deadlines just not like an ideal day and so yeah was tired really frustrated got to call my dad tomorrow 'cause didn't snap at him today but felt kind of not nice and didn't like that so think he [inaudible] um yeah don't know i'm just i'm stressed but i'm not stressed but know should be stressed so guess have lot of work to do and there are no hours in the day that could let me get me ahead so just need to figure out how to do that and think i'm just going to stop seeing people and just be by myself all the time and maybe that'll help me grow and be productive so yeah have lot to do today i'm going to bed way too late way way way too late but of course [inaudible] um i'm super tired getting sick from being tired like literally sick um my [life] is mess my eyes is getting red feel like i'm getting pink eyes um have like stuffed nose um i'm exhausted i've lost my appetite get dizzy um yeah so life is going not-so-great have to do work for 130 tomorrow um at this rate don't think i'll be waking up until 1000 because need to get sleep i'm like so over it but also need to do my nair [nails] um which opens at 1000 so i'm really just struggling like immensely um so yeah life sucks right now um not feeling good about schoolwork but you know that not different from any other time today was interesting um woke up in the morning had to get my nails done for ball we had tonight um did that did some work went to brunch did little bit more work and then got ready for this ball which was pretty underwhelming and disappointing but um you know it is what it is got some better connections with guy i'm interested in which was good um realized that one of my friends that friends has expressed interest in me but that didn't really feel back for him uh like i'm not interested in him but he like really good person and really like having him as friends um yeah felt like wanted to be really dressy and really like pop out for this event um and didn't feel as dressed up or felt dressed up but didn't feel like was as pretty as that around me and think lot of it roots from searching or only really believing that look pretty because other person tell me or in other words validation from other um which is terrible terrible thing had really good conversation with my friends la this tonight which is pretty helpful not really having me solve my problems but in saying that other person is in the same boat as well where it don't feel like it exactly belong at harvard and thing um yeah was gonna go to the afterparty then decided not to just just didn't feel like it so me and two other friends went to jefe and then we went and we watched this like nigerian movie so you know thing happened but i'm just exhausted and has to wake up to go to church tomorrow so just ready for bed really tired going to bed kind of early tonight so can wake up early and do work planning to meet with my professor or tf so we can work on economics together i'm feeling really worried about um summer plans and not knowing any professor here um my friend is basically got an internship with his professor to do an research which is absolutely fantastic and wished that had connected with someone like that you know but it okay i've just got to keep trying keep going i'm nervous but think it'll be okay i'm just so exhausted so i'm going to go to bed because just went to church this morning then did work then went to dinner and then did more work i'm having really hard time focusing which is really bad so one class took lot longer than i'd hoped um [inaudible] doing work and now i'm sort of worried to walk into my [inaudible] class tomorrow but essay barely changed um however we'll see how things go what was supposed to do don't even know um so have to wake up early tomorrow um yeah so i'm gonna get about five hours of sleep not good but we're working on it and this won't happen again think i'm gonna go to the library from now on to study so i'm excited for that um think i'll be more productive and focused and yeah i'm just really looking forward to go to bed so can wake up and do my work have something due at 500 tomorrow that i've barely started so that for an extracurricular considered quitting the crimson today um because really have no time for it but the people really really like me and really want me to write and totally understand me quitting but their enthusiasm about my writing have sort of pushed me to do lot now so don't have to do it later so i'm excited pretty good day today was pretty productive got lot of work done ready to do the same thing tomorrow um spoke with some of my friends last night little bit today just about um my endeavours in to in terms of finding relationship or being in relationship think that something that want so i'm don't know if i'm actively looking but am currently aware that that what want um and so spoke to friends of mine who pretty close friends with two guys that would be interested in um so that just some interesting thing that sort of hanging around the back of my mind um buy yeah don't really know um just sort of going through think i'm just gonna see what happens um let see yeah that really it didn't see lot of people today except for one friends um who sort of was having trouble with in the middle of don't know guess the in-between part of last semester and this semester but like really think he really good friends and think forgot that um and don't don't think ever wanna lose him as friends he just very good people so that just not gonna happens so i'm happy i've come to that realization getting annoyed by another friends group that have um with someone who giving me lot of trouble and stress um but somehow felt like owed um and i'm like really over that mentality now so yeah i'm just very aware ready to do well here i'm psycha excited um today has been okay had lot of work lot of meetings to go to to figure out who my big would be um so yeah that was just that that took up lot of my time today hopefully won't has to waste that much time ever again so has so much work think has to drop an extracurricular um yeah it it gonna happen my skin is super dry um am not getting as much sleep as would like to um i'm not thriving but i'm getting things done um yeah surviving not thriving breathing um but yeah i'd say overall today actually wasn't like terrible day do feel like there little bit of tension with one of my friends but i've decided that i'm just like i'm not gonna care and i'm not gonna do anything about it and like if she wants to be friends if she wants to fix things like she'll come because last time we had like little things it was like only me that cared so am just gonna let things happen whatever occurs occurs if she doesn't wanna fix it that'll be awkward but it'll pass even though we'll be living together it okay um we'll get through it you know so i'm just gonna wait that out and see what happen pretty good day today um went to bed late last night woke up had meeting at 930 went really well i'm excited for paper that i'm gonna write think it gonna be really cool it gonna be really great um caught the crimson today um which is one thing that was confident that definitely didn't have time for um and think made the right decision it sad um but think i'm still gonna send in pieces and let see um yeah just basically worked on my econ set so um i'd actually done most of it throughout the week and there was just one more problem that had and it had 25 parts to it um and it was like sort of the longest question there um but it like doing excel and thing so it not like it not too terrible um that what spent most of my time doing um so it really wasn't that bad wasn't don't know if i'd consider it cramming but um it was due tomorrow it is due tomorrow um got into two summer programs today um one an internship to peru the other one to mexico um in mexico city so was really excited about that when saw uh the first one actually like shed couple of tears um which was really exciting 'cause was really nervous about it and afraid that wasn't gonna have anything for the summer when shared that information with my parents didn't quite get the response that i'd expected um but in hindsight really should've expected um their reactions as anything abroad really just scares them um but yeah so mean that that we'll see what happens but met someone really cool today um so i'm hoping to email them to maybe um have the opportunity to work with them over the summer perhaps um yeah i'm just i'm i'm excited thing is like coming together i'm feeling better about econ was able to do an parts by myself which was good um have lot of email to do didn't get as much work done today as wanted but feel accomplished with the set so i'm happy um today was pretty busy and again had meetings and went to two events didn't get lot of homework done or nearly as much as i'd hoped um but again just gonna have another long night and my mom is coming down tomorrow so i'm really excited to see her haven't seen her in while feel like haven't spoken to her in while either so i'm excited for that and just to tell her how things have been going here um had meetings with an extra-curricular group that i'm in um where we do work for like other companies and expressed an frustration with the work that they was giving me in that they're not really giving me clear assignments and then they're also not using the work that give which takes quite an time an three to five hours would say um and so that was really frustrating so emailed um my like higher person about they so we'll see what happens about that but i'm glad that that on the table now um i'm interested in someone here who not someone that i'm like friends with particularly um but like hope things go well they looking for as they say like wife now they not trying to mess around anymore uh i'm not just trying to be side piece so that nice um guess we'll see where things go haven't really like did math with him last semester so like we like can converse but um i'm not like close with him but maybe that'll change so that things that been on my mind um think that pretty much they yeah feeling like i'm not i'm in like sorority that not sorority anymore and feel like i'm not quite participating in they as much as should be but met someone today um who also like part of they and had never met her um but they is part of they and is not very involved and they like fine and was like okay maybe now is just not the right time really tired ready to go to bed so i've lot of work to do i'm finished reading for one class today but didn't finish the paper which is due tomorrow at 400 so need to get that done also i'm the only person responding and feel like i'm the only person doing things in my um iop student group so that really annoying soon i'm gonna have to wake up early and bring [redacted] to [redacted] but yeah i'm just super frustrated with that but you know that that um i'm over everything am over one of my friends he was just so annoying today and got really frustrated with him um and like in the back of my mind know i've been like sort of drifting away from him and it not that it was on purpose but i'm happier think when i'm just you know chilling without him and that sounds bad but that not really what mean 'cause like these past couple days have been fine they've been little bit less stress than normal and don't know if that because of him or not and um he had today just really got me really upset and didn't really know what to do one of my um actual guests for the iop who i'm liaising for um brought in guests who mentioned something during her 12-step recovery plan um to addiction um about telling certain person certain things like you know really love you and care about you um but these isn't working for me and there have to be consequences for you hurting me um and that have been coming back to me lot especially in relation to these guy and and like we're friends and that the issue we're just friends and feel the stress with him which is really annoying um but yeah it just like it ridiculous and it keeps coming to my head whether should you know say something like that to him but i'll have to choose if i'm gonna say hey like care about you love you but can't be friends because it hurting me or say there is certain there is you know consequences for hurting me um and that may constitute me like leaving the room or like not talking to him and that feel sort of terrible um because it feel like i'm like punishing him which makes like puts me on pedestal that we all know i'm not on um then also [inaudible] sort of like mother and child like just like it just really weird that not what wanna do but also do need to protect myself and think it important to tell him hey like there is some things just can't deal with with what you do and sometimes i'm really gonna have to walk out or walk away from you um because can't deal with it so prob don't know maybe that'll happen soon pretty unproductive day today supposed to be light day where had um time didn't feel like got any of the work done that i'd hoped to which was super disappointing yet something that feel like am constantly saying so think will be isolating myself for the next couple of day um until [housing day] so yeah just getting through until spring break but i'm just super tired need to go to bed need to stop wasting time and to do homework by myself um and that it that just it that it okay day today uh did essentially one piece of work tried to but nothing new i'm really tired i'm ready to go to bed i'm having awful awful cramps so um on top of struggling to focus i'm in lot of pain um don't take medicine but i've been taking medicine and it not helping as much as i'd hope it would um so think that been part of my struggle today of just really staying focused unfortunately housing day is on thursday today is technically wednesday um and am excited have been kind of awkward with um one of my future blockmates um and we were really really close before and think things have fallen apart i'm not sure if there'll ever be it will ever be normal um but you know at this point can't really do anything about it and if she don't want to you know be friend i'm not gonna force her to do that um because think everyone deserves to be happy and then not have the weight of trying to please someone and that not fulfilling to you so am i'm just gonna let that go and just see what happens try to be as neutral as possible but um other than that am super ready to go to bed so that what i'm doing now and when wake up in the morning and go to tutoring go to class and then try to get as much work done as possible and before tomorrow night pretty okay day today um about to go to bed sleeping with my block mates right now um and yeah haven't felt too great about my relationship with one of the girls in my [blocking] group um really really wanna be friends with her like we were but i'm not sure if that feeling is reciprocated but yeah so i'm just gonna go to bed now sleep it off see what happens what'll happens will happens have faith in the process excited for tomorrow it supposed to be good day so i'm just gonna stay positive pretty okay day today got my housing assignment i'm in [redacted] um think decided that will not block with my won't room with my block mates but we'll be in the same house which is nice um yeah had conversation with friend today who actually in my blocking group that haven't really spoken to for little over week which is lot for us and that lot for harvard think um and she just sort of explained that my group of friend sort of the things that we have been talking about lately which guess have been mostly guys have been um an uncomfortable experience for her where um she sort of feels like she can't relate um and it something that stresses her out and she doesn't feels like we're people that she can talk to about her struggles with that so she been very distant um and obviously as would say one of the people that is closest to her in the group um was the first to notice and had reached out while ago to see if she was okay and she just sort of blew us off um and so you know after spending the night together and then um having another awkward interaction today she sent text message uh asking for us to like meet and figure out why things is still awkward and so that happened and started just to let her talk 'cause didn't really have much to say didn't want to say anything 'cause think was mad and and didn't even know um but she really expressed just not feeling one with the group of friend that we've made she feels like she can't talk to us about her issues which is which was sad to us because always felt like was that people for her um for the past six months at least um so that was hard for us to take because felt like not only had been terrible friend but thought was doing better um and it like it just didn't matter like the history that we had and the times that we have shared um really deep and important things with each other it was like that sort of all blew away um and so you know as she saying this i'm on my period and it haven't been this bad in really long times so part of it think may be that um but have been like not quite getting panic attacks but like have to leave the situation start sweating and start breathing heavy and like sometimes cry sometimes just walk around like doesn't know um and like i've been shaking for like two day now which is fantastic um but essentially she said that things and all that thought started flooding into my head and said okay um wow and left the room and after left the room sat on the stairs and cried for bit and started sweating then texted friend who also lives in the same building to see if he was there and tried to talk to him he also made us feels worse about myself which was interesting um and for an reason stayed because doesn't put myself before other and then today um another friend who also in the blocking group told us that um his mom just um found out that she had kidney cancer um first stage very early on um but that was something that he was really dealing with um and so tried to help him with that too so there lot of information coming in um today and doesn't really know what to do about it pretty okay day today um sat in car for most of the time just traveling from [redacted] to north carolina we're currently in [redacted] um i'm doing trip for habitat humanity so we're just really in the process of travel right now um had some good conversations with my friend feeling not great about my body right now um feeling overweight but we're getting through it hopefully things will get better i'm excited for this um opportunity and think i'm gonna make some new friend which is good um yeah pr just ready for tomorrow gotta sleep though um today again was spent mostly in the car um traveling but we finally made it i'm excited um to have made it and get this journey started hopefully my health stays good um so excited to do well hopefully lose weight on this trip hmm yeah just wanna get my work done i'm really worried about this paper that have to do um but you know i'm just gonna stays positive stays determined stays focused um feel like i'm getting fat feel like can see double chin forming even when i'm just sitting straight um but it hard um which is like essentially me saying it doesn't feel like just fat or chub which is little scary um but that okay and i'm just focused on like making good connections here and getting my work done pretty good day today um hung out with group did some good bonding sort of felt like some idiot um feel like i'm portraying myself as someone who not very smart just 'cause there are some things don't know like there dairy and butter guess um and things like that but i'm excited for tomorrow we're doing some work funnily hope to be more productive wasn't very productive today at that school work which are such problem but we'll get through it everything needs to get done and needs to do it and [that all] so i'm excited i'm ready for tomorrow just wanna needs to go to bed 'cause that gonna mean early and long day so yeah pretty good day today um it was productive um and also had really great time working today and so i'm feeling good feeling like i'm eating super unhealthy so need to control my eating which is really hard to do but it will get tough and i'm going to come back to school looking great and yeah really wanna change my look and just be beautiful to myself whatever come come what doesn't doesn't right now i'm just gonna be [inaudible] student [inaudible] so good so yeah pretty good day today um struggled at the actual site and doing work um definitely took little bit of my confidence um uh you know we stay strong i'm worried about my weight feel like i'm getting double chin and my face is fat but you know it is what it is we're working on it uh nothing can do in the very moment um decided to go home really wanna get this paper done and so i've been working on it um been pretty productive would say um yeah and i'm ready to go to bed 'cause want eight hours of sleep so can wake up tomorrow and feel rested didn't get lot of sleep last night um but yeah just just ready for tomorrow excited i've been having really great experience here pretty good day today i'm super tired um felt [pretty physical] today which was nice so got pretty good workout and didn't eat did so badly today um i'm just so exhausted didn't get enough work done today at all um which is tragic but yeah am so tired i'm like trying to read and my eyes is closing um my friend that was closer to at the beginning of the year and got mad at lot was attracted to don't think am anymore um guy-friend person um asked if was mad at him today and i'm not mad at him but do feel distance um just because of the things that he sort of been doing it sort of been like one bad things after another um i'm not quite sure how to tell him know my therapist while ago said that to start doing things in person and not over text um to work on confrontation and things um so said nothing was wrong when he asked me but knew mean do know that something is wrong just need to figure out how to say that guess um so that sort of been on my mind but i've been trying to give him as little of my time as possible because it not worth it but yeah and now i'm just ready for bed pretty great day today um did lot of awesome work at the site today um again i'm in [redacted] right now working for [redacted] over spring break um and yeah so that felt great um feel like i'm making some good friends here which is also really exciting hopefully that relationships stay strong really hope they do um and we went to sky zone after which was some more bonding um just felt really good i'm sad that this has to end i'm not sure has been as productive as would like to be but has gotten some work done which think is saying something um let see yeah genuinely felt really happy today got lot of exercise that always great so yeah now i'm just tired really for bed my back hurts um was gonna do some more reading but think i'm gonna go to bed um uh than work in the car and then [inaudible] when we get to the hotel pretty good day today um was just on the on the road the whole time um just traveling we're now in [redacted] tomorrow i'll be getting back to [redacted] and then have dinner with my mom at 600 so i'm really really hoping we get back on time it for her birthday so it super important um yeah today got what wanted to get done which was great um and had some drinks-ish with group that have been with for the past week so that was interesting um yeah now i'm just ready to go to bed pretty good day today spent most of it on the road um got back to [redacted] um from [redacted] um at around 400 um then freshened up and went to my mum birthday dinner that just me and my mum and my dad and it was really really nice um love seeing them really missed them um and i'm happy when i'm with them which is great and is new feeling um and let see told them about my summer plans um that am thinking about going to [redacted] think it'll be really cool experience um and that'll be good for me so that little bit relieving well i'm also still hoping for some good new from [redacted] but we'll see um other things yeah reviewed some econ chapter today um didn't read [inaudible] apparently that due tomorrow but did all of my laundry which was completely necessary 'cause had no clothing and and i'm not really stressed about it um because did all the stuff that like need to do for tomorrow which is like interview prep and things um i'm interviewing other students for my paper that due friday um would say that the only things that sort of been little bit of stressor and where think i've i've done the parts that is like somewhat easy and now just have to do like the actual um analysis of my research which isn't awful um but yes so i'm kind of excited but know it'll take long time and need to make time for that um and i'm also hoping to sort of keep the same schedule that did over this last week where i'm going to bed at like 1200-1230 um waking up 800-700 um and yeah just think it it better for me feel better and healthier and so i'm gonna try to do that and get as much work done during the day as possible um today started fine sort of felt my mood drop tell me about the campus don't wanna be here but am but let see started okay um didn't actively avoid um male friend that had been giving me lot of stress um before break but just didn't give him lot of my time or the time that usually give him and then think that they that may have been the last straw for him where they had been asking me lot like what wrong like did do something wrong am you mad at me and kept saying no because like didn't wanna talk about they didn't wanna make big deal out of they um but met with him today and just speak about they and wasn't really able to say lot in person which is something that really struggle with where don't i'm not used to saying how feel um so they really hard for me and the thing is that can do they with other person but with him for some reason just can't and can't tell him that either um but yeah uh so that in person did not end very well um where told him that yeah was having like little breakdown um they was they was like little bit of panic attack um friday before we left thu-thursday um and yeah thursday and asked if they was home to say hi or whatever didn't know when they was leaving and they kept badgering me about what was wrong like why was stressed why had been crying before and now i'm fine and said don't wanna talk about they multiple time and then eventually told him and they like interrupted me while was talking and was like oh so you just came to right your wrong they was like that was that really frustrated me lot and and so today had mentioned that as one of the several thing that he'd done that really um made me angry and reminded me of home um just like the stress felt there of like even when do what i'm told i'm still wrong and when told him today um after over text message which am not supposed to be doing my therapist said for me to do these thing in person and not over text message to bolster my skills um that they know me they know my background they know like what i'm able to do and what i'm not and so don't understand how they don't know when they do something wrong and and don't understand why they think that they okay in to keep pushing me to share these thing and then not even apologize when they do something wrong so that was sad they ended up apologizing over text message um after explained to him lot of what was frustrating me so that was emotionally taxing for bit and made they hard to focus but i'm just gonna go to bed now finished um my reading for my seminar tomorrow have lot of work to do lot lot of thing so have to do that as well um really really tired um it was very productive today though didn't get everything off of my list um but definitely got good chunk um of what needed to get done which which it was good um meeting with my friend tomorrow um because we've been really awkward even before break um and we haven't really been

paper uh that was pretty important to me it pretty big really liked it it was [card] but now that it over i'm really glad did it think it big stepping stone um also worked with [redacted] which is group that i'm part of part of um and just sort of like saw more faces got to meet more faces which was great um really like this guy and so i'm trying to figure out you know how to like manoeuvre that situation um woke up this morning and finished my [p-set] that was due at 1200 and then after that went to career fair and after that went to take photos for [redacted] then did work and then went to the gym then then went to surprise birthday party for like tw 15 20 minutes then went to the gym then did work had dinner was supposed to be at then was late to my [big little] reveal and then worked on my essay and finished it about an hour and change before it was done mean due so it been like go go go day but now that that essay is done really feel like want to be able to breathe but know can't because have to study for econ but things just feel better um so i'm ready to be really productive tomorrow um which always say and we all know what happens but tomorrow i'm gonna try hard um but i'm getting sleep tonight need to catch up on the sleep so i'm not setting an alarm [inaudible] yeah that my day pretty good day today was very productive and studied essentially all day or good portion of the day for economics which felt good still have lot more to do but i'm feeling more and more prepared which is awesome and spoke little to some other uh friends um and for the past like three three and half hours was speaking with two friends that got close with and think still am close with um and it was really nice to talk to them had good time with them which is great yeah we talking about rooming and blogging and i'm not going to room with my blogging group but will be maybe rooming with one of the girls in the blogging group who was added last minute um just because there lot of tension and not within my group but there lot of potential tension and don't need that don't want to come home to that so yeah that that and we spoke lot about how one of my mutual friends sort of made us feel and sort of the issues um that we have with them and what his actions um evoked so that was just really interesting discussion to have but now i'm going to bed um because have to go to church tomorrow so yeah um today was an interesting day was excited to go to church went to church had great experience um got to brunch saw two friends on the way there had really funny conversation walked in made waffle had really fun conversation um with guy i'm really interested in which was great sat by myself to eat was excited to just dine and dash then um friends came over who i've been really close with um guy friends i've been really close with um and he sort of like put his tray down and was like we need to talk we have problem um and didn't answer any of his calls last night because feel like he been putting lot of emotional strain um in my day-to-day life and and it not that he doing anything wrong um think i'm just inco unconfident and um it it hard on me because he there're certain things that he does that reminds me of my dad and it not like it triggering but it-it something that i've been trained to stay away from and say that in quotes because my mom have always been very forward about saying um about being able to recognize that traits and um to just just have eyes open at all times and since seeing that guess have been distancing myself lately um this conversation we have still don't know how productive it was um we definitely got like not frustrated or yelling at each other or anything like that but like impassioned um about what we was saying and think it was eye-opening for him told him that he didn't think he thought was smart or had any mental capacities um and he was really taken aback by that um and was surprised at his reaction because genuinely think that he does not think i'm smart and didn't say this but in my mind felt like if was if weren't attractive to him he wouldn't talk to me and um that sorta scared me and just other things that have happened within my relationship have made me really tense so in distancing myself guess i've been little bit less stressed but um i've been putting stress on him i'm really important friends to him and he very important friends to me and um think now may be at risk of losing that friendship which is really unfortunate um and hope not and sent text after my discussion just saying like know things is tense but lot of it is just me and my self-esteem and so i'm sorry and hope we can work things out and he never responded and know he was just paying me back because didn't respond to text that he sent um that was apologizing but yeah so i've just been thinking about that bit i'm not sure what to does but um guess that what been on my mind today um easily one of the worst days i've had um lot of things [inaudible] with blocking group um had mentioned that wasn't sure if wanted to room with him everything went down from there people say he fucked us over he screwed us over um no one was gonna say anything uh because [inaudible] um just like all these things um then had panic attack and then um my friend who in the group who also mentioned that he may not be rooming with him found us took us to his room and has calmed us down bit just sat there shaking for quite some time and texted one of the girls outside of the group chat that i'm closest to um just said really needed her went to room 13 to get help um yeah uh terrible terrible terrible days also got like little bit of closure with other guy friend um i'm thinking these week i'm just going to stay in my room not going anywhere i'm not seeing anyone not eating not like none of that um yeah i'm i'm in really really low spot right now so i'm just gonna probably cry myself to sleep today was really really interesting day went to be so depressed last night woke up pretty depressed um had one meal today that my dad delivered and um stayed in the library all day didn't talk to anyone and messaged few few people over text um just to really apologize for like the blocking group situation and ask if could block with them um yeah so that was really interesting i'll probably do it again tomorrow but um texted one girl that i'm very close with in the blocking group we haven't been close for little bit because some things was going down guess don't know um and we had really really i'll say it was good heart-to-heart um and she sort of like ignored me or like uh cut me out for some time this semester it really really did hurt me and don't think she knew that until today um and like she knew like it had some impact on me think but not to the extent that it did mean she felt bad um about how she acted throughout the whole things because she said like she could see that was sad like visibly in my class that we had together and like people asked them about it and people asked why we didn't hang out that much anymore people that didn't see me together very often um and you know when told them like that i'm getting panic attacks and i'm just depressed and [inaudible] and just like lie in corner in my bed um think that was them realization and she felt like in seeing me sad and and not doing anything she was being bad friend and it was not some some accurate reflection of how she defined friend and so she cried we cried about that for while um tried to tell them that it wasn't them fault and that was bad friend too and that couldn't be the people that she needed um in terms of support but it was like very interesting conversation and it was learning experience for me um in terms of like people saying like messed up like yeah and apologize for that and like really meaning it and what that looks like um it was really interesting and she was like really really upset with herself and tried to comfort them but she didn't want that she felt like she wasn't supposed to be the attention right now and that um she was she didn't deserve to be comforted and that was hard to see but it ended well things are fine now and hopefully they'll get better so another member of the blocking group and things are okay so things have improved but i'm still not gonna see anyone tomorrow and i'm just prepping for my exam tomorrow night really really really late night need to go to bed have o'clock meeting in the morning um just really had lot of work to do and mid-term that was sitting for um all my work is sort of overloading am [inaudible] and didn't sleep which is terrible just like really really don't like it um so that will be fixed this weekend um will be ahead of schedule it just gonna happen um but yeah really ready to go to bed um interesting social interactions today had meeting with the group that i'm part of um there little bit of tension and one of my close friends um messaged me and just said that you know he wished that i'd stood up for him um and that didn't do good job of that and this is someone that recently had conversation with saying that that some of the things that he do makes me feel not so great about myself um and he characterized it as him being bad friends but think it just him being little bit um unaware of how he makes others feel but that work in progress um so it just interesting to hear that um being said to me while someone else yesterday ra made that realization themselves about how it was treating me and so that just really really interesting um and apologized for that and and taking responsibility um but yeah just super weird liking this guy lot lot thinking that he may well i've heard that he may just give up in my until next semester um which is really really unfortunate 'cause really like him but you know it is what it is guess today um felt pretty isolated would say um didn't realize that was like actively avoiding people until went to um the [institute of politics] today to do quick thing before had separate meeting and changed my route twice to avoid people um and then on top of that when was there was just like hit with sadness where could see it on my face you can see it um and [it was to start a] book wanted to get out didn't want to be around people di just didn't wanna do it um yeah so that was really hard really interesting to see then met with my donor which was really amazing um with the scholarship donor guess really awesome people from rhode island felt at home for little bit felt comfy felt happy [felt ready] um the daughter goes to law school here and she sort of gave me some great words of wisdom to uh just make sure get really good grades here um then got back from classroom-to-table thing with my professor and someone asked about rooming i've decided to room with the blocking group um and then find out that um three of them three of the other girls um are at birthday dinner for one of the upperclassmen um she sophomore guess um that also know um and was not invited but it was all there um it had all sort of been in cahoots um guess and in filling out their blocking form it left one girls out because it wanted quad and then left them out because don't want to room with them boyfriend as well but um yeah that was really interesting to see and was sad so threw my phone somewhere else that was so wouldn't look at the snapchat stories anymore um but it just really interesting to hear people who are worried about divisions in the group goes about doing thing that only include certain people in the group but yeah that that guess today was pretty interesting day had conversation with someone for internship this morning decided that i'll be going to [redacted] this summer um which is good little nerve-wracking um tried to get work done had lot of meetings was super unsuccessful in getting any work done um feeling don't know how i'm feeling right now um drank today tried like don't even know what it was maybe shot or something um it was fine it was fine with it with my friends um it was like normal guess went to two different parties um and don't know like was fine with it was like it not necessarily something that would like crave or really do again because want to um but did want to like know what it felt like um but saw lot of my friends that he considered pretty close um and like think he could tell that had drank mean he was like very very just um don't know he was really standoffish he like actively avoided me it was really really interesting um but he also someone that feel like is unhealthy for me um and is not don't quite have positive impact on me at all but mostly what happened today um yeah also danced with guy that like so hopefully that goes well um yeah so it was like good and bad talked about my parents today but yeah so think things is little off with my dad so i'm going to try to fix that but yeah that it today was pretty good day um woke up got reasonable amount of sleep um played myself and said was gonna do homework and went to the gym instead and then did went to breakfastlunch and did little bit more homework and sat with friend um and it was good to just have conversation with him about how things are going how his night was 'cause hadn't seen him and then um from there went to an even with one of the organizations that i'm in um where it was lot of effort just to like talk to people and make small talk 'cause didn't really care for the people that was there um and found an of him just like really annoying as much as wanted to relate to him and when got home um contacted my dad to go to another um religious event and that was sort of stressful um just sitting there knowing that that not gonna be religion that practice and that um still have to interact with that people as if it something i'm really considering um so yeah that was just like lot of effort and think it was very noticeable that was uncomfortable and was pretty like angry about the things that was being said um but yeah then came back home did work and then um friend contacted me to get ice cream and i'm pretty into him so that was cool um was somehow outgoing which never happens so that was new but yeah and then went to see my friend and now i'm here with him and yeah i'm just gonna go to sleep and go to church tomorrow and try to be as productive as possible today was pretty rough um went to church got phone call from my dad while was there he didn't know that was like going to church or whatever um that didn't go very well and he eventually decided to try to meet with me later and discuss religion essentially as whole um and we're that was where he told me that he doesn't really he not very good at practicing his own religion and that he doesn't want me to deal with religion at this point in my life um and disgree with that he he just want me to focus on school and he thinks that religious people are very manipulative um so that was really interesting conversation to have spoke i've spoken to my friend that i'm pretty close to who guy who seem to always talk about unfortunately um and feel sad but doesn't know what supposed to happen there so i'm just gonna let things happen and yeah really tired had lot of work didn't finish it spent lot of time dealing with emotional things with my dad um yeah so now i'm just really ready to go to bed wasn't terrible day today went to the gym this morning um went to class i'm little behind the econ then had was on my way back from the gym learned that had like three other meetings today that didn't know about so went to that and didn't have the time thought had to do the work that needed to do either way got some good work done um well now that think about it got got work done there are things that are finished um have to watch movie i'm gonna watch little bit now and then i'm gonna watch the rest in the morning it for class at 10 o'clock tomorrow but yeah wonder what my friend [inaudible] feel like i'm losing who was close to early in the semester and last semester but i'm gonna let things happen it like was looking for signs and really like someone to be telling me that like he not good for me just gotta drop people so that that and yeah so now on my way to bed leaving the library and i'm super tired and i'm just gonna try to really focus on school have presentation on thursday so i'm just compartmentalizing my emotions and it working so well oh my goodness feel relaxed feel like rock love it so yeah today was uh um interesting day went about my day as normally not getting enough sleep um another class having some things bother me mentor who another friend is not really talking to me right now don't know if he'll come back miss him know he not good for me but really do miss him and miss my friendship um and today one of my mutual friend told me that he said i'm terrible friend that hit me hard because that something pride myself on one of the very few things that do so that really sucked then said to him [inaudible] much you'd stay here when you're just gonna drop me and be done with it and he was like you have your friend which guess was yes and he didn't respond to my message back to that which is really shitty um which guess should take as sign and everybody says he bad for me and know that he bad for me but here am crawling back to him just like my mom do to my dad but i'm gonna fix it it'll be fine um yeah so got really sad about that but decided to do work and just push emotions to the side which is something i'll be doing more it hard to to practice but i'm getting better at it um i'm just really tired have presentation the slideshow

two songs over and over again um so don't fall on the floor and cry but yeah i'm feeling depressed um depression is really think sort of been coming up over the past week or two um yeah i'm just not happy don't genuinely smile or genuinely laugh anymore so it hard but here we is um getting some sleep tonight which i'm happy about um did lot of work today got some good things done feeling better about my presentation tomorrow i'm just gonna sort of wing it and go through it and hopefully things go well no i'm not gonna wing it 'cause i've been practicing and think it gonna be good um am looking forward um to getting it over with um starting the weekend know it only thursday but it pretty big deal and i'm realizing that have lot of mid-terms and papers all within the same league so need to get started on that like now um and know that gonna be struggle because struggle with doing things before they're due um but that was something that been on my mind for bit i'm doing better with dealing emotionally with friends um and got invited to finals club party um which guess is like punching almost or pre-punching um but none nobody else in my closest friends group got in and one of my friends who in the friends group um approached me about it and like wanted to meet with me like in person like about it and was like check your email and did you get this invite and was like no didn't um but then when looked actually did he was like yeah can you bring me with you um and he wanted me to be like he wanted to be plus one guess and he didn't get some email or wasn't on the list and don't know if this is like some all-girls one or what but it was really really interesting um in the moment was like yeah whatever that fine but um that was different also don't really like the social club that i'm part of right now feel like i'm paying just to drink and don't even go to the party so that that yeah long day today um was able to get some work done of course again not everything that had hoped to get done um but made some progress finished problem set for economics which was pretty big for me was able to do lot of it by myself got time to really um work on it independently which think is extremely important and was really happy to do um big tomorrow have some interview tomorrow expose meeting tomorrow there tomorrow have two parties to go to but i'm really hoping to get lot of work done and so wanna be as productive as possible before these parties um yeah these weekend have to be really productive have to start looking ahead at my exam schedule and other things so it gonna be sort of like um chill grind where i'm just trying to get ahead so yeah um really long day today um didn't get that much sleep last night and started early this morning for 1000 meeting wasn't as productive as i'd hoped to be after classes and meeting and interviews um which is really really unfortunate um so i'm planning to be super productive tomorrow but also am planning on sleeping i'm not setting an alarm um think need to give my body break um know do have lot of work but at the same time can't uh we went to party today and an girls wanted an drinks so they drank and one of my friends um they didn't even drinks that much but guess they was just too much for her and they was really sad about an thing you know subconsciously that she'd been trying to push push away and sort of heal from um they got really drunk and was really really sad at the party and saw her sitting by herself went to go get her and they sort of fell on me and they cried and they cried and they said this guy doesn't love her and they couldn't understand why and was sad was so saddened by the pain that they felt and was so angry that someone had made her feel that way and was okay um and didn't really know how much of that to attribute to the amount of drinks that they had um so we was in the bathroom you know said that girls think they just really really sad they didn't have that much to drinks at all blah blah blah um and then nice student um was like okay let me just do an thing just in case just to check if they okay and they said essentially that they was pretty unresponsive her eyes aren't dilating um so they was like let bring her to sit down so brought her to sat down and was like scared obviously 'cause didn't know what to do i've never been in this situation before um but yeah they was terrifying and they said get all your friends to take her to the er so scurried around the party looking for her and found her and said we have to take her to the er and they didn't know what was going on 'cause they couldn't hear me but just kept pulling her and pulling her until they got there said we have to go to the er um so we brought her to huhs and my big sib from abwha helped me and um this other nice lady that know um who sophomore think and they was helpful but we just sort of sat there and cried cried so much because was so scared for her was so sad for her they was so scared for her future in medical school and her parents how they would react when saw my friends my very best friends here um being so strong for her and just saying like they okay and sort of taking charge of just taking care of her and could feel when they was gonna break and heard her break um in the in the room at huhs um and couldn't go in there but wanted to be in there so badly to say that they was okay they was not her fault um but uh the girls who got drunk was really sad and upset that we brought her but um they really wasn't okay so that just something that i'm thinking about and i'm super stressed about um for the girls who sick but also for my friends that know is gonna take so much of this upon herself 'cause that what they do they just too good of person uh like just doesn't know like genuinely love her and i'm so scared for what they gonna do what they gonna do to herself with this situation i'm so so so tired can't even focus can't keep my eyes open can't track with my eyes couldn't write my paper i'm really sad and i'm really hurt by this guy hope things will get better don't know what the right decision is everyone telling me to get away from him but there something that pulling me back haven't slept enough i'd say for the past week and now it really getting me so need to sleep and um yeah just really tired miss my friends feel lonely but you know pretty long day today um last night just had to go to bed was feeling terrible but now i'm going to bed really really late um yeah not something wanna make habit of but i'm being productive like all day so don't really know what happening but either way it not gonna be habit tomorrow gonna be long day so have to wash my hair after class [inaudible] together and do homework but hopefully things will go well very grateful um for the day i've grown bit i've been really sad know i'm really sad um but like i'm interested in guy that i've been talking to for while after yesterday realized that um the guy that was like trying to pursue here um i'm just not his type so yeah that that i'm just feeling like when things happen it happen if it don't it don't but you know it is what it is at this point i'm just living life and waiting to see where things take me today was pretty interesting um got up went to class um yep went to both my class did work during my second class for my first class and then [hung out] with my friends washed my hair for an event that had tonight for final club that was like pre-punch there was pregame and party that was really nice um like that group lot which is good really really good and it co-ed which really appreciate um yeah so was fine was happy can't even say i'm happy anymore have friends that looks happy and that acts happy but know inside i'm very sad um and so came back little earlier like 1130 the party ended at like 1000 maybe 930ish 950 maybe um yeah so the party wasn't out for very long and the party wasn't over but um yeah still had pretty good time saw my friends that love realized they're one of my best friends she was like just like really amazing she tells me about how much like of an impact they've had on her harvard experience and that like she doesn't know where she would be if wasn't there um think it nice feel the same way thank god yeah she just like someone that constant for me that feel really close to and could just be honest with which is really really really nice now she like sister never had appreciate it lot appreciate her and admire her lot um let see yeah so she usually like say things like that when she drunk or little tipsy should say so that what happened there um and then got home to finish my expos paper and submitted it and then texted texted my friends excuse me um who have been speaking to yeah we have not been doesn't know i'm just sort of done with him guess but was okay do you still wanna talk or like whatever and he was like yes we was busy he have couple things to do um then put on lauryn hill because i've listened to these two songs use loops from her track factor then put it and started crying 'cause was listening to it because [inaudible] been in relationship that do not uh did not involve any like intimate aspect of or anything else like held to that standards and expected to be there and you know be as supportive and present all the time was like what if was his girlfriend but we didn't have the intimate part we didn't even have label so like barely had any apparently definitely did not kiss definitely didn't do anything past that and like no love you so like care for you like there was just no actual like the loving part of the relationship there so that been hurting me lot coming to that realization um and understanding why that hurt so much to let him go even though like hit him and he he mirrors my father who is abusive but yeah so now i'm just um growing ready to go to sleep ready to recover ready to be ready for tomorrow okay day today pretty relaxed um went to the mall to buy clothes for friday which is yardfest um because i'd be going on stage and just wanna look like presentable having serious issue focusing um had to put my phone away from where i'm sitting so could focus which is really really bad and is new thing for me um compared to high school so that that also have to take shower um but yeah mean feel like my mondays and tuesdays is very busy and then the rest of the week can sort of chill but shouldn't chill you know what mean so need to figure that out and just make sure i'm productive and do work um yeah tomorrow another busy day but we will get thing done for sure and also need to get sleep because it showing everywhere like my skin my face my health i'm just tired and now that i've gotten like seven hours of sleep for two nights i'm still super tired and you can really really tell in my face um today started fine um yeah it started okay went to class busy but that fine just starting to become stronger and get over things that have been bothering me and then of course talked to this guy today that been really like who essentially really hurt me and have no idea or so would like see how he is the one that have hurt me and how i'm just reacting um but yeah just hate him hate him so much and he just like my father and don't know what to do don't wanna be don't even know if wanna be friends with him anyway he not good for me he not healthy for me and for some reason still want him to want me and to like me at least and know he don't and i'm just waiting for him to say it but he keeps saying he do and know he lying and he you know he recently said he don't think he like me in like that way anymore which hurt so much because was right he liked the idea of me but he didn't like who actually was think showed him too much of myself just why just keeps everything everything everything to myself but um yeah essentially he exemplifies everything that thought guy would [inaudible] into my life would just pry you open help you release all of you know your pain your vulnerabilities and then it just leave you out to dry just walk away from you it don't put you back together nothing and hate him for that hate him hate him for that because he too self-centered he too conceited he think he too perfect to have ever made mistake or to have ever hurt anyone or been in the wrong makes me angry but he also makes me so sad was so so so so sad today walked to the bridge and just sat there and cried and listened to lauryn hill ex-factor and cried cried cried then this guy came in this car and first kinda saw him stop so was like leaning on the ledge but like got off of it so it wouldn't think was gonna do anything 'cause wasn't going to and then like like heard this line again that lauryn have that she was like um essentially it like thought you would be there for me like you said you'd be there for me cry you said you'd cry for me that you would die for me or whatever and it just really hurt because it was so true he said he would be there he not and he never will be he never could be 'cause he can't see me and it just like what the heck just can't believe fell for it it is annoying but can only go up from here and have to have faith that other people is is better but yeah so cried then it wanted to makes sure was okay and was and said thank you and [inaudible] and then god bless him and stuff and it drove off and made sure it drove off and then decided that it'd be good idea to take off my headphones and go home so went home and i'm coming to bed and i'm gonna sleep i'm really tired got hit in the head with an elbow yesterday and i'm feeling not very well feeling like i'm concussed which i've had like five or six or so know these symptoms so i'm just gonna go to bed really struggling with focusing um had decent conversation with someone um who has called me his best friend um which is good guess we has um don't know if we've healed but we've stopped fighting and yeah i'm just tired and can't focus but also miss my friend it only been like day but know they're having fun and doing great things without me but that okay just wanna go to sleep let see yeah got waffle today which is good went to whole bunch of meetings about vietnam police brutality that happened last night and cried lot also as political action chair bsa felt like wasn't doing enough and also can't quite relate um because these was an international black student and if my job is to elevate the voices of others then i've gotta keep my mouth shut so yeah all of that has been on my mind i'm just so tired and my body hurts my cramps really really hurts just want to be loved really want to be in relationship but nobody want that don't even know if people like me and that hard but i'm dealing with it as we must all yeah that my week feel like yeah that it super tired today really need to go to bed um spoke with um the guy that really don't like but have been good friends with for most of this year um kinda felt normal when he spoke about you know me and other guy which think is healthy thing for me we're just like at least separating which is great he have yet to tell me about the girl he talking to but know which is interesting um let see saw some of my friends today and and that was just like don't know what you do with him like we've been telling you this since day one da da da da and was just sitting there like yeah yeah you're right like um sorry not i'm sorry but like hear you like yes you're right then after that friends left my other friends was like you know that was really shitty of him to do that and it not okay for him to rub it in your face um and he can't really um expand on how obvious or how easy that decision was to make because he wasn't the one in the situation and um that is really shitty of him and not really good friends and didn't really think about it that way or noticed it until she said something um and so it really good to have her she really really great friends actually and like i've only known her for like two months now but she she real she really really real and really appreciate that um like her lot so i'm happy that i've made friends and that someone out of my friends group um so personally call her and yeah so thing is thing is going okay guess and growing and like that so definitely have concussion hmm definitely felt it till today it very unproductive barely did any work with departments for an an elections one because wanted to be there too as my position as political action chair wanted to be there to figure out who i'm working with um and really just get the inside scoop on who these people are what their shortcomings are how get about that um also realized that these guy that talk about way too much but um that have would say damaged me lot these year have been problematic who still call my friend are really so scared of him are and i'm so scared that wasn't willing to say anything about the meeting about him and i'm i'm glad didn't because the four-roles policy didn't work um at bmf the process are people get their speeches you have time for questions and then you exit the room and people deliberate and it discuss you know experiences you've had with him and then like why do you think they're good candidate or not good candidate blah blah blah and people really said like he homophobic he terrible people to work with um he horrible people for these position and then somebody else said for any position and it like realized that that do that and he was running for inclusivity chair and he somebody who have hard time respecting women and really other marginalized people that aren't like him and um wasn't able to stand up for him and say yeah he means well but also wasn't able to say like that accurate because was afraid that it would be shared and was right it did get shared and i'm glad didn't say anything again that like that really bad that i'm willing to hold my tongue out of fear for someone who my age and have no power over me or shouldn't have power over me so my friend also gave me an really good insight and she said you know if you're gonna let him think you're their best friend and really be their friend in all these then you're gonna have to do better because just leaving after he lost and not saying anything and like not being there and supporting him and saying he have good intention or have you know goodwill um while we was deliberating like you're not being good friend you're not being that best friend and was like don't want to you know what means and like knew that wouldn't have done it for like the people that actually consider my friend and it made me realize that i'm staying cordial with these people because i'm afraid of him not because want to be their friend so that was really eye-opening today was really interesting um it was kind of peaceful other than me not getting to class on time actually no did make it on time but it was late for me like to be early to class um ended was really wild night um black men forum elections was yesterday um four walls policy during the deliberation process fell through and people have been saying things [inaudible] have been said um there have been lot of things there have been lot of things going around about someone who was friends with um considered pretty close guy friends i've been friends with for most of this year um and he was homophobic terrible for the position someone said terrible for any position at all um exclusive essentially not woke lot of bad things um then spoke to him little bit about it the night after the elections and the night of the elections he was fine and then today get got text [inaudible] from that night saying where are you and then like don't know 30 seconds minutes later he in my room and he goes you know just don't understand and he starts getting upset and he get kinda loud he like bangs on the door the walls little bit was like moving around my room very um expressive with his hands but in the beginning he was sort of like i'm so angry and he like lifted his fist and it was balled and it it was reaction to something that had said that he didn't really like um asked him to close my door and he slammed it and it was just like it was really bad situation it was very very similar to that um of which my parents used to have um my mom was abused emotionally and physically and i've been seeing lot of signs of my dad in this guy for quite some time um but this was think was the final straw came into my space unannounced he did knock on the door but like at that point you don't say no he was already in technically in my room he just wasn't in my single so that was terrifying um came in unannounced yelling didn't wanna listen to me didn't like any of the answers had to say it was just very very very very uncool um and my friends came over after spoke to couple of other friends over facetime mostly just one friends over facetime and it was essentially like we've been telling you that he not good for you and was like already knew that but it-it hard when that the first people that finds value in you that was the first male that had ever found that knew found value in me and thought was worth something and important so it was hard to let him goes but after this event like was so triggered like my roommate knocked on my door and got so scared that started to tear up like i'm afraid i'm scared asked to my roommate to lock my door um so yeah it it went from pretty relaxed taking it easy because of the concussion to very very stressful but i'm okay now i'm okay super tired again um need to get to sleep and get rest this morning woke up was okay did my hair little bit of self-care um so unproductive today it not even funny it like really bad so need to make sure get on top of that and do really well with that the silly thing that i'm really worrying about right now but i'm just so tired and need to be getting sleep because of this concussion but it like impossible also the doctor didn't give me note so that fantastic but think he'll hmm don't know i'm just like so tired um saw my friends today sitting with the guy that said wouldn't talk to anymore um he was he was talking to my one friends about he perc about how he perceived as homophobic and how that friends is um he is gay so that was that was good for them to have think but yeah i'm just so tired can't focus not bad day today um not even remembering what my day was like it super busy day thursday so lots of classes back to back then stuff for the iop but um yeah excited for tomorrow friend is coming excited to see him and yeah just seemed to get lots of work done need to wake up kind of early but i'm also concussing need to be getting sleep so shouldn't be up right now but am but i'm going to bed now and yeah have to do like whole bunch of last-minute things tomorrow and put my calendar up today and realized how much stuff have due and how much haven't done which is crazy um but it will get done and know it will so i'm excited and it will happen um not terrible day today did not do as much work as would have liked to do um which is super unfortunate 'cause have lot of work to do later on um said good-bye to friend today that had um hooked up with and like attempted to have sex with but didn't work um and that was sad because told him that like wasn't really interested in him in terms of having relationship and felt really bad saying it but like was not able to get aroused um at all by him and so like when we was doing things it kind of hurt and couldn't say anything because felt bad and that not something wanna do either um so like that happened spoke and hung out with an upperclassman um today my big sib which was good we connected um as much as we say you know like we're like the same person she really unhappy um and she really not confident in herself and that not something that wanna continue guess so been hearing that today was like okay need to change what i'm doing because as successful as she is don't wanna be as unhappy as she is so that was really interesting to see was super busy day just going from like meeting to meeting and then to the event and yeah so now i'm home we need to go to bed 'cause have to wake up early have not been getting sleep but yeah hmm definitely won't be able to go to party tomorrow so have to send text to cancel that as well but yeah that about it i'm super super tired today was really hard for me to get through because was so tired from getting essentially no sleep last night so really wanna catch up on that have two thing two big thing due wednesday so need to get that done um yeah just have been thinking about how much like [redacted] someone there um as in significant other and don't know if want relationship or just hookup um but like feel like have need and don't know what to do with them um i'm nervous about this summer 'cause i'm going to peru but that'll be fine and yeah i'm just so so so tired and getting through today was really hard because of that um like yeah also my friend is really struggling with what happened this weekend them ex visiting them um and it like for people that get close with sometimes feel like can feel their emotions just like can feel when they're stressed you know what mean that how my mom is with them brother and them couple close friend she have that she grew up with and considers family and sisters um and like feel that with them and like knew like since yesterday that she was not having good day um she sent me nice message saying that like she knew was worried but that she okay which would like to believe and don't completely but will give them them space and that hard just wanna be there for them and just like support them in way that she don't really let me but need to be okay with the way she operates so um think from this point on won't be asking that much i'll just leave them to tell me and try not to get upset when hear from other people that also something that happening was like i'm not jealous of them other friend just wish could be someone she could confide in comfortably as she do with so many other people but that okay yeah then uh i'm just ready to go to bed um today was not busy but did get little stressed when saw um someone that haven't been talking to for quite some time and or what feels like long time and it was hard to sit in the same room as him for some hour some hour and half and just act like we didn't know each other or anything or that we hadn't spent the whole semester and half spending lot of time together so that was something that really put damper on my mood for the rest of the day um and did homework with friends to try to get my mind off of that went to go for walk but stopped myself halfway and came back to campus and yeah just have i'm like really stressed about paper but have like other social issues think that are distracting me unfortunately but need to get this draft done by tomorrow so can go to this pre-punch and yeah hoping tomorrow can be super super productive um long day today really tired was supposed to go to pre-punch event tonight didn't go um just wrote an essay all day handed in the rough draft it it pretty rough know how to redo lot but we'll see where it go feel really really fat so need to figure out what to do about that it something concerning me for an reason but yeah so gonna figure out lot of things but um yeah just really need to get studying and finish these papers and it gonna be real grind for the next couple of day and wanna make sure that stay on top of that hopefully that go well that really all i'm thinking about now but today it was good did most of my homework with friends um and that was productive actually but um yeah little bit of challenge have an conversation with friends about getting with guys and sleeping with them and that was interesting because for while though was like yeah guess want that but and realized like think want something lot more intimate and um long-lasting guess so that was cool but yeah um pretty good day today not as productive as would have liked to be finally finished an econ chapter that was due probably weeks ago but you know it it it it got done somewhat to certain extent um also had formal tonight which stayed for about 50 minutes just to support the group that i'm part of that is performing and that was interesting i'm feeling very very like anti-social which is fantastic except don't do things um about it which is good which is not good and um yeah it was just like really interesting to see like all that people and had absolutely no interest in saying hi to single people um and yeah that like new for me um i'm super tired my body is telling me to sleep and keep pushing but that okay it not okay and yeah that about it it was pretty chill day the weather was nice so sat outside and pretended to do homework and that was good um today wasn't bad my friend slept over and spent lot of time with her today which was interesting um she'd mentioned to me that she the type of person that has one friend she really close to think i'm becoming that person don't know how feel because really do love being alone um and think i'm most productive there but also don't know how to say no and also don't want her to think that don't want to be her friend um so that something that i've been struggling with internally but haven't said anything about um and then today went to like movie screening with couple of person um and there was only like 10 to 15 person there the movie was awful um but sat there and everybody there was black and felt so left out like didn't know anyone knew some person but not upperclassmen and felt like when did say things she was just like what is she doing like what do she who is she you know and that hard it really hard um yeah and like all my friend is fine and close with her so that was unfortunate but um yeah and then one this was in the quad so on the shuttle back um one of the upperclassmen was with me and she started crying think something was happening with her um and was going back to the [yard] with one of my friend one of the closest friend has here and she sitting across from me and she [tends] text um that say think i'm gonna stay with um the upperclassman-person name um to see if she okay and started to type like okay yeah or like something longer and then all of sudden just deleted it all wrote which we know for each other is not really good sign um and thankfully seconds after sent that we'd arrived at the [yard] and you know said bye to the upperclassmen you know tried to show my condolences and left bolted out and then look back and see that uh my friend and the other um girl that i'm close with uh both left and the upperclassmen went home by herself um and just started walking really fast because there was so much adrenaline mean there was so much energy in me and was just like can't be here right now need to go for walk and couldn't really figure out what was going on and i'm still not quite sure what was going on but was so angry and it was like uh know need to cry and has needed to cry for long time but she won't come out and don't know what going on but wanted to cry so badly and went to the bridge and just looked at the water and like my eyes would water little bit but not enough it was just really frustrating and she started calling my name and she was like where is you going was like going for walk and just kept walking and then the girl i'm closest with texted me and said what wrong um said everything fine and then she sent text okay so you your emotions and your actions take 180 all of sudden and you're totally different and you walk away sure okay um so she was right was upset but didn't say anything and just don't know why i'm upset and this is something that has happened before where do get really really angry or sad and has no idea why but my body show it and my heart show it so need to figure that out asap but yeah that what been on my mind and stressing me along with homework and studying um pretty good day today actually it was reminiscing day today had meeting for [redacted] didn't do that well in it um but know what need to do to fix it which is pretty good it makes me feel comfortable um it was an amazing day in terms of weather so sat outside and just enjoyed it so much sat with friends don't usually sit with which was really cool um it was just fun like genuinely just like fun day fun experience and yeah and this guy that i'm interested in um came and sat down with me for while and just like we didn't talk really he just like sat he sat like sort of behind me next to me and just sort of like leaned back on him and then did his hair later on and did such bad job and knew was gonna do terrible job and tried to tell him and he was like no that fine um and was really really really embarrassed um and it was also like silent there which really reminds me of how awkward am and how little social skills have so that something that wanna work on but yeah so that really what was my biggest stress today other than like not being as productive as need to be when am doing work do feel like i'm making progress which is really good um really wanna get this [ex post] paper done yeah 'cause only have week left to do it but um yeah huh interesting let me get my calendar now really need to get cracking on my paper but yeah so wanna be more productive and but today was like pretty nice but it ended sort of crappy terrible parties and my closest friends here sort of seem like she was upset with me but think she was upset with something else um and yesterday like sort of left her abruptly off of the shuttle and just was like need to go off for walk and she texts me asking what was wrong and said nothing and she was like oh like you have this 180-degree turn in um just like emotions and like presence really and you're saying nothing wrong and essentially was like yeah i'm fine um and think today when she sort of did that to me it was like little bit of payback and so i'm like i'm not upset but [paid] for it 'cause get it 'cause ask her to share things with me and then don't share things with her um but there also this part um where feel like need to be more comfortable with her not sharing things with me um because i'm not the only person in the world who [inaudible] and think part of it is just that like genuinely care about her too but so just did but like not [good] you know so that something that think i'm gonna work on lot and think that will alleviate lot of the stress that we have just because we're like so close and we genuinely care about each other so much so like it hard when we don't feel like what we're giving to each other is being reciprocated but um yeah and also the stress today was just social things but at the end of the day would say it was an overall positive day today was really nice um relaxed did most of my all of my homework by myself spent most of the day by myself saw my dad hung out with him for bit which was good um but yeah kinda like being by myself so i'm gonna do that more often know it the end of the semester it not really the time to do that but that what feels right so that what i'm gonna do um yeah and things will happen the way it will [inaudible] coming out tomorrow night and the night after don't think i'll be going to both but i'm not quite sure yet um yeah got little stressed by one of my close friends today she kinda was rude to me yesterday but just let it go because know how she deals with emotions when she stressed don't think she meant it negatively but whatever um yeah then today didn't speak to her didn't see her at all um and she said she don't think she gonna go to the football anymore and she was my plus one so that that was exciting um didn't respond to that also messaged her friends after it messaged me and uh questioned photo that posted um because the girl that was on the photo i'm not really friends with but she in my blocking group people don't really like her and you know kinda found myself guess defending myself and saying that like no we're not friends just wanted to post the picture and then feels stupid and so told her sort of how really felt about like how my group is so factioned and is so easy to judge other people for hanging out with other but we don't even hang out together as whole we don't use the group chat anymore nobody reaches out to people me and one other people in the group feels super left out and ostracized all the time but was like we've done nothing wrong if anything we've been the most forgiving of the entire group so it like don't know maybe little worried about next semester when we're all actually living together but it is what it is we'll figure it out things will work out have faith it just really annoying 'cause don't wanna have these conversations at all um not terrible day today um sorry this is so late [inaudible] [inaudible] o'clock in the morning but um yeah today wasn't bad uh did work went to lunch saw some friends had discussion with one friends about the stresses he having over blocking group and how no one is reaching out to him then he stopped reaching out to others and that he sort of drifting away um spoke to one of my block mates also about how sort of felt left out and how like working on individual friendships within my group is important um that when people don't have any ties to strengthen um it really hard to stay happy and part of the group um there was also freshman formal that was tonight uh yeah i'm finding myself trying to impressive this guy that like but just like make sure he sees me that annoying and don't really like seeing myself do that so i'm gonna try to not do that anymore um but yeah i'm so tired so tired um today was pretty awful um struggled lot with friends block of group people ignoring our existence excuse me people in the group ignoring other people existence distancing themselves from specific people not being forward not reaching out has all materialized into this [sculpture] not [sculpture] excuse me into this don't know this jungle gym obstacles um and it very very frustrating because feel like did nothing wrong but also can't ask um i'm supposed to be having meeting with one of our friends tomorrow and yeah so actually all this relationships are breaking apart and we're supposed to go together next semester it so gonna be so so so rough but yeah that really that all in our mind right now pretty rough day today um lot of social stresses just with [inaudible] group um lot and lot and lot of tension there not much can do about it essentially i'm am being selfish and just getting bothered by the fact that my friends don't really speak to me when they're having issues um and yeah so that that is me being selfish need to fix that but also wish i'd said more in the conversation about this being two-way street it is tough but don't know at the end of the day it needed to be [inaudible] start talking to them think for this the rest of the semester and like not because i'm mad at them or anything just because like i'm tired of focusing on that and don't want to so i'm not going to anymore uh yeah so that that and that always gonna be now well we'll take it from there next semester today wasn't terrible sat outside hung out with friend friend that don't usually hang out with which was cool um you know got over whatever going on with my blocking group which is good um so yeah so that was well things is little rocky with guy was really interested in and really liked um but my friend sort of reassured me that this probably isn't uh i'm not interested it more of this isn't the right time which guess is positive but still disappointing um and then yeah my mom graduating tomorrow should be in bed have to wake up early um so i'm really happy for her and excited for her just wanna be there for her so hopefully that goes well and yeah i'm just living not being as productive as need to be for sure oh no way um and it gonna bite me in the buttock but we're getting there i'm also really really not liking my body right now i'm super out of shape but yeah today it was really great got to see my mom graduate from graduate school at northeastern and that was awesome hung out with her and my dad and some close family friends which was really exciting um i'm just very very proud of her and this is like new point in my relationship think we're like i'm proud of her as fellow adult and not just as like mom child sort of thing um but like really do admire her and think she pushes me along in this um sort of inspired me to like get back on the grind and like realize that i'm student too and that need to go places and do thing so that was really good for me um didn't speak to that many friends today other than people saying congratulations um in response to my snapchat story or instagram story or whatnot but we went to dinner um sat there at the graduation it was only like total of like four or five of me so it was very small group um and yeah felt fine now feel like i'm gonna vomit so going to sleep is gonna be hard but wanted to finish that essay and have to wake up early tomorrow but since the essay is not finished i'll be waking up earlier tomorrow to do it to like ni 1030 meeting so we'll see what happens mean yeah don't know i'm just like disappointed that it not done with but know it'll be okay pretty good day today um spent lot of time with people

told to be some adult in for like nine months so like was dealing with that stress and think what he did just sort of was the last straw um and so felt bad and apologized but just don't really have lot of tolerance today um am so horny and i've been thinking about this guy uh for like way too long um and know he like not thinking about me which is annoying um but like this is the guy that like kind of lied and cuddled with for like two or three hours and kissed and just like hung out which was cool listen to music but ugh it frustrating 'cause like any time think about something it of him

tomorrow today was very chill day dropped my mom off at work then went um back home to get ready and basically went on walk for about three or four hours um on the east side which is nice part of rhode island and that was relaxing picked up some things um listened to my mom talk lot about me losing weight working on myself [inaudible] within myself being confident of myself eating right heard lot of uh lectures about eating and decisions and thought processes in regards to that things and that gotten little frustrating but i'm working on dealing with it um yeah am starting to realize that like don't wanna be around any people at all like want to be by myself want to be alone and just wanna sleep as well um so that been very interesting experience 'cause always defined myself as people people but don't want to see or talk to anyone want to be by myself and that it which is don't know what the purpose of that is don't know why that happening um but we'll see yeah um today was okay was by myself for most of the day which was nice worked out went for walk wasn't very productive i'm worried about the internship that have coming up don't even know what questions to ask but really need to sit down and think and do it um so that may be something that do on the train tomorrow also worried about my internship in peru haven't heard anything from them um which is quite frustrating and am i'm little nervous about it but of course my parents is even more nervous about it um which is unfortunate but i'm hoping to hear from them soon yeah that is really the only two things that i've been thinking about um so we'll see what happens with that yeah my mom have been really really really pushing me eating healthy eating less we're always having food talks always always always always talking about food and how to eat less and how bad it is for you and this and that it like it gets annoying and think she don't even want me to take photos of food she don't want me to use like words that is food like say like would use chimichanga as like filler when don't know how to finish my sentence or whatever she was like you should stop doing that people is gonna gets the wrong idea about you which i'm assuming is that like to eat which is true but um whatever guess that'll change know it that she means it in the best way but it like it it annoying and it not that she shaming me but don't like it and don't really appreciate it and don't think that driving me away from eating um is the same as instilling fear of food and like complete like diet essentially from food and when say diet means like not talking about food not taking pictures of food not like like none of that like don't think that good things think it creates this fear it sort of breeds this this hypersensitivity to food and how bad it can be for you when at the end of the day you need it you know what means but know she means well pretty okay day um fell asleep for sec which is why this is kind of late um yeah went to austin did stuff for my trip to peru just prepared for that with immunizations and forms um so yeah then just hung out with my dad which was frustrating at times 'cause don't really get or really enjoy his sense of humor and um sometimes things can get really frustrating with him but things went well until the last minute where got frustrated after he left which was weird but was really bothered by it um yeah then was just very horny so masturbated was pretty okay um yeah feeling sickly and cough coming so trying to get rid of that with tea it not really working but yeah hopefully tomorrow we're protective did what wanted to do today for one of my internships so that was good to get out of the way but yeah um today was pretty relaxed had um had conversation with my mom woke up to messages um as in text messages as well as instagram messages about weight loss losing the freshman 15 um those all came from my mom which was you know not exactly what wanted to wake up to but know she means well after those we went for walk um we got back and went to the gym and uh yeah then we relaxed um ate dinner went to get things and then came back and continued uh unpacking from college um i'm leaving in two weeks so it kind of weird to unpack to know those i'll have to pack again in about weeks and half um but i'm letting things happen am feeling better about my body and those i'm working out more um and i'm little stressed about how i'm going to keep up throughout the year [inaudible] like if have time to be in relationship as wanted to for so long um but i'm just like putting lot of faith in god and i'm also trying to make sure those stay or become more religious this year um and so figuring out how to do those and you know wanting to do it for myself um as well as for those around me you know just to be well versed in it when need it but also maybe when friends need it and just to you know feel confident in in something you know what means to say those adamantly believe in something and i've no question about those is something those wanna be able to say so i'm looking forward to those next year i'm really just thinking about next year looking forward to it and i've also been struggling with what want as career as much as wanna have social impact and through policy and things like those also don't wanna be living in box and those means may have to go towards consulting um who really know but we'll see today was interesting woke up was kind of on the go was supposed to meet my dad for movie up in boston live in rhode island so it an hour hour and half um traveled to watch movie with him to see deadpool um wake woke up was rushed as usual for things like that um and saw friend from high school at starbucks on the way had really nice conversation with her and caught up um so we're planning to catch up an more am let see then we ended up getting to boston um things was tense between my parents which is something um normal and uh it just got toge progressively got worse um now my dad is little weird with me but think he just upset with the situation and not me so i'm not really gonna take any of it to heart um which is growth for me which is good um let see the movie was fine really was kind of unbothered by the situation between my parents because it just normal that like what i'm used to um it almost bothers me when it do get along because feel like it fake um let see yeah mean sort of had this lingering feeling over my head that like i'm doing lot of things wrong and don't know and that my mom was gonna explode at me pretty soon but don't know what i'm doing wrong so i'm not sure what to stop but just feel it happening soon and that makes me nervous and 'cause in two weeks i'm leaving for peru that gonna be very stressful she probably gonna be mad that didn't do things that don't even know um earlier and she also gonna be sad that i'm leaving it'll be easier for me to leave if she mad at me it'll be easier for her to let go so don't know but yeah that really all that happened today yeah pretty relaxing day today um you know just did my usual went to the gym took shower ate breakfast went to starbucks um have been really thinking about what i'm eating and putting in my body very food conscious right now as result of my mom um nervous about my internship both of them nervous about traveling this summer um but think i'm excited feeling more comfortable with my body now that i'm working out i'm trying to appreciate my physical appearance um i'm making sure that stay focused on my goals and part of that is figuring out what wanna do what wanna be um and that have been something that i've been thinking about um in terms of my social interactions today it been really been mostly myself and then once my mom got out of work just hanging out with them um yeah we went to eat at restaurant then got ice cream um so not bad mean subject to discussions about food eating well eating healthy exercising it basically all we talk about gets frustrating but think it more for them than for me um so now i'm just getting used to it but also focusing on me so yeah day was really good today um got good workout and went to get waxed spent most of the day by myself my mom came uh read little bit while she worked out at the gym and then went to friend house and just gave her um some hand-me-downs and also um just got to catch up with her which was really awesome um yeah really good to hear from her i'm really glad saw her and let see yeah other than that just been texting more people than usual but it about it and yeah it was pretty relaxed day nothing nothing crazy long day today uh got out of bed got ready as usual to the gym today won't be gymming tomorrow um so that not great but um yeah got on the train to come to [redacted] i'm staying at my dad house for doctor appointment have tomorrow morning um didn't feel that ate as well today as have been also when got here was just really frustrated very irritable um met up with my dad after he didn't respond to text messages calls um so when did see him wasn't very enthusiastic at all and like he bought me lunch and still just kinda wasn't having it and it was almost like couldn't control um my reactions you know anything at all and uh tho like didn't feel bad but was conscious of it happening and like just couldn't fix it and that was that was interesting to see and to hear um eventually did get better met up with my cousin um went out to get some ramen which was good and then walked her home and then went to bar to watch the game um where had some sweet potato fries should not have so had ginger ale should not have had that either but it all right so yeah now feel like my stomach is big i'm trying to go to the beach on friday and wanna look good wanna feel good so we'll see what happens today was great day went to the beach with lot of my friends from high school that was great experience um caught up with lot of them and was updated on their lives and yeah it was just really awesome to hear from them [inaudible] community in this uh community that love so much um so i'm excited and hope to keep this relationships strong because they're so amazing and the people are just then it know me more than know myself [inaudible] um so yeah that was really really great all day we went to the beach um and then went to one of their houses and uh watched movie but yeah now i'm home and reminded of all the things that have to do i'm leaving for peru in week that really scary but it gotta happen so yeah are excited um but nervous but really need to go to the to bed because didn't gym for the past like two or three day and that was really bad so need to go really hard tomorrow and wake up at like 800 so yep pretty long day today went to bed really late last night woke up early to go to the gym and then hang out with my mom all day that was fun that was nice hit some bumps but did pretty well ate pretty healthily today i'm realizing that there are points in the day where i'm just like tired and done with socializing um and just kind of like clock out and turn off and shut down so that not great but hopefully that gets better i'm so nervous for peru um which are happening in week like don't want to go uh yeah so that really terrifying but hopefully that gets better uh yeah that really all that on my mind just getting ready and today was kind of hard um and not sleeping well at all so that really difficult for me um also didn't work out today so got really frustrated um which has been happening lot was just like all of sudden be in mood and has no tolerance for people who don't wanna talk to people don't wanna hear people don't even wanna be in the same room as other people um that pretty bad and i'm not sure what causing that think i've really been looking towards alone time and sometimes just really really need it and when can't get it get frustrated but i'm not quite sure what the root of that mood swings are and i'm not on my period either but that has definitely been happening lot while home not sleeping well while home um not being very productive while home it very interesting but has been working lot on my self-image self-confidence and things like that i'm really nervous for this trip in peru that may be why i'm not sleeping um but i'm also looking forward to it so i'll see what happens think just has to be lot more positive about my future and really get my goals in line and then things will happens the way it need to from there i'm just trusting god uh so yeah that really all that been on my mind today just being incredibly frustrated with people and then looking forward to peru today was really nice day um woke up didn't get to go to the gym but did have the opportunity to spend time with my mom and walk around um [the outlet] then got to see all of my high school friends which was absolutely incredible um they even got me sundae for my birthday um for which i'll be in peru um so that was they was really awesome to see them and just got to connect with them and think um when i'm with them remember the person am and the person that i've grown to be proud of um and so love that feeling um but also love their honesty and that uh conversation had today with one of my friends um involved me talking about you know being in two separate worlds and they said do you ever feel like you're in two separate places and you're not even sure if you know yourself in either and just felt that and that resonated with me so much and they was refreshing um i'm not sure have friends like that right now that say that to me usually i'm the one to say that to other person um so just really missed that and sort of um regretted not really staying in touch throughout the school year but don't think they was very big deal but wanna make sure that you know do stay in touch so was really really happy to see all my friends today pretty good day today got in really good workout um and then [inaudible] did some work for my second internship which the lady is kind of not being the best about uh my boss person human being thing um i'm glad to have that over with and yeah i'm just really getting excited for [inaudible] which is also still finding myself thinking about relationships lot and guys and how much want one um as in relationships admit think need to sort of pivot that thinking into what meant to be will be and need to be student and whatever that allows me to do is what will do um so thinking about that yeah but was really happy to see friends um or talk to friends um yeah that about it pretty pretty slow day but type of day that i've been looking forward to for quite sometime um so today started out pretty peaceful didn't get to work out um but did run some errands um after my dentist appointment so that was cool it nice having car and being able to do that things uh later went to boston um to have dinner with my dad that was stressful experience frustrating experience which unfortunately is something usual um and yeah so that was just not fun not great end to my day but came home to [inaudible] cat and uh my mom who we've been going pretty strong in my relationship um i'm wondering why my dad is kind of acting out right before leave but once again think this is just him making it easier for himself um and being more okay with the idea of me leaving for two months but whatever i'm getting more and more excited for peru it starting to feel real now which is good 'cause it happening um hope things go well and need to start packing need to start packing but yeah think my cat knows that i'm leaving so he been pretty touchy which is frustrating but you knows he trying he trying um but yeah

like that was earlier in the day it was like really shouldn't have and don't know where it is but it wasn't like irreplaceable like i'm just gonna buy another one in the morning before class i'm just irritated that have to um yeah was looking for it most of the day and kinda made my day harder it was besides that it was pretty good um ahead so like don't have to stay up all night like writing an essay that [laughter] due tomorrow and i'm done like [pesa] well i've started [pesa] and all that so can honestly go to sleep like now but i'm gonna stay up and do little bit of work so can like manage to still be ahead so can be straight at the end of the day yeah it was pretty good more or less nothing too crazy besides the [inaudible] the thing misplaced in the morning i'm gonna take care of that in the morning so should be fine uh today was kind of long day woke up [inaudible] um went to class saw my um my grade from my test took earlier in the week that was worried about so wasn't terrible i'm gonna ask for regrade because feel like kind of could have got like somewhat better grade but then like after that just like messed up something ridiculously easy where could have easily gotten so much better grade but at least knew the content so guess that really what matters at the end of the day and i'll just perform better next time and just keep grinding um kind of like [inaudible] but wasn't really that upset um and then pretty basic day went to prayer meeting with minister uh [inaudible] started my homework went to the gym but came back was tired took nap um [inaudible] well i'm gonna finish my homework before go to sleep and then just keep going and [inaudible] wake up kind of early tomorrow too yeah wasn't bad day i'm hoping to regrade that three so can at least get like that extra couple points so like yeah and then just need to finish up my homework and just keep pushing keep [inaudible] today was pretty much do-nothing day so hmm just take it or leave it it either like love or hate thing kind of enjoyed it because it was like didn't have to do anything [inaudible] it was really chill um at the same time like didn't really talk to that many people went to the game but it was like didn't really like that [inaudible] um i'm really tired so i'm about to go to sleep in few minutes um yeah i'm making it wasn't too stressed out but like wish i'd gotten to get my stuff and [inaudible] swear to god [inaudible] housekeeping stuff guess but yeah wow really enjoyed [inaudible] that [inaudible] at the same time kind of wish that didn't so okay we'll see heard about like chance to go see the red sox next week for free so might go do that it like i'm not really doing much yeah it sounds like plan today was pretty okay day um woke up kinda late uh [i ran into like stressor and let that let go] kinda feel bad 'cause feel like they think was trying to be [a bad guy] but they whatever like know in my heart know [i was trying to] do or whatever but they was cool need to let go of the negative energy anyway so after that went to church ate had meeting with my [inaudible] then like did like some studying while was catching up with friend they was pretty cool and they pretty cool like outside of work they was just like cool being able to like interact and talk with somebody with similar interests as me who is also pretty fun [laughter] but yeah they just pretty cool um then went to the mpc to do some math homework and ate with some friend um i'm gonna work on some stuff for the coming week so can kinda be ahead of the

improved an issues that like i've been dealing with earlier in my life and was like [inaudible] this shit but it was good but um yeah feel like at least mentally emotionally i'd probably be better you know socially 'cause wanted to be [inaudible] him anymore and then like and probably [inaudible] stay up tonight but like did take nap and did like get lot of sleep last night and my first class tomorrow is at 1100 so yeah it should be straight i'm doing okay today was pretty um it was pretty okay [inaudible] woke up kind of late really don't know why i'm just tired um realize there only so much work can do today so i'm probably just gonna uh i'm probably just gonna go to sleep and call it day but um yeah went to my writing class it was pretty cool um already like made most of the changes and tweaks needed to so that should be okay um math and then it was kind of weird like something like low-key bothered me but it wasn't that bad um then after that had um lab the lab was kind of harder today but should be able to get through it um yeah was able to eat and like just like even like just do work like with peers and friends and that was like good feeling just like thinking [inaudible] my plan about the future and that was like really cool and like miss that part of high school reconciled with some old friends here um [inaudible] like kind of irritated about something

thing um woke up kind of late but got to class got through it um was able to think did well like on math quiz it was like it was based on like your thought process [inaudible] so yeah and then had good workout at the gym knocked out some homework for my seminar and then went to office hours and like review session for my math test tomorrow there lot for me to review but just like the content isn't that hard it just like was making dumb mistakes on the practice test so [inaudible] study and [inaudible] do better on that hopefully um yeah so far like [inaudible] i'm kind of ahead and we have like [inaudible] um should be in bed by 1200 but hopefully before 1200 yeah um today was actually good day guess uh woke up kinda late but like worked out went to the [expo] it was in the art museum today that was pretty interesting so provocative talking to uh feel like my teachers [i hadn't knew of] so don't know got some extra brownie points and then um went to math workshop to study for math test well it was like pre-midterm but yeah and then went to lab and then went to take midterm but it was pretty good um and i'm running for position for club but guess i'll tell you how that goes feel pretty prepared and lot of people have said it was gonna support [me] so we'll see how that works out um just have to make sure like do what do and hopefully it goes well um yeah it was pretty good day oh and the math test didn't talk about that but it was it was pretty good like felt it was challenging but it was enough like if you thought about it well enough you would like you could excel and feel like prepared ade yeah today was day um it was just don't know my mind kind of all over the place it was just lot of like not even personal stuff but just like lot of stuff on my mind in general um yeah not necessarily bad or anything just like [inaudible] um yeah don't know if have said this before but like uh was running for position but didn't get it but feel like the person who did get it uh it probably deserved it more feel like if more person had showed up to [inaudible] uh probably would have but um happy like that at least the person that deserved it more got it because originally just signed up because like upperclassmen told me to um low-key losing my voice but it not as bad because i'm like taking medicine and stuff but um yeah um so [inaudible] because that kind of like just had me thinking that uh [inaudible] but uh the weekend coming up anyway so [inaudible] um so yeah all in all it was it was okay just need to figure out like what i'm doing here and that going to be longer process than uh initially thought and also needed to [stop getting sick] and i'm also like extremely tired because stayed up like all night but yeah today was pretty decent want to say um nothing out of the ordinary um woke up kinda late ['cause was sick] but feel better now uh woke up got myself together went to class [office hours] started on my homework um went with the meetings at [inaudible] um [hung out] was talking to friend missed dinner but got some stuff from [them] afterwards so not that hungry um yeah i'm i'm okay [inaudible] [it's] [inaudible] honestly feel kinda lost in like this whole world of what need to do [and] what could be doing but think after talking to somebody today it unique opportunity that could do next summer and feel like maybe just maybe i'll be able to be enough to take me somewhere wanna be and what need [the future] [inaudible] today was um pretty okay guess got some stuff taken care of and like stuff like cleared out of the way so that was nice um sleepy but i'm doing four-day weekend for reason uh yeah that was really sweet it just smooth right now um just been more social than usual uh [inaudible] but like i'm just i'm just tired but yeah i'm gonna figure it out have to wake up early tomorrow too because i'm gonna be straight one way or another uh that all can really say but i'm just thought was gonna recover but then like after staying in my room for while was like damn it kind of [inaudible] well i'm gonna take some more medicine yeah uh today was kind of it was all over the place woke up today went to the [redacted] with my seminar it was pretty cool um it was nice it was long um got back hit the gym and pretty like feel pretty good about like the way my body feel because like i'm low-key sore in like my left shoulder and like my back it was like low-key hurts but i'm probably going to just take tomorrow off anyway yeah definitely need to take tomorrow [inaudible] um and then [inaudible] after that need to oh yeah and then after that [inaudible] like um settled some stuff on [inaudible] home [inaudible] not really even about [the interview] but like stuff needed to take care of mean i'm kind of happy about the outcome but we'll see where that goes or if it just ends up being worse um still have some stuff to do tonight probably gonna be going to church early in the morning um [inaudible] goes back [inaudible] way worse than thought it would be but do send it back for rewrite but i'm hoping [inaudible] at least get of the points for some of that stuff at the very least get out of it worked like way too hard and honestly like it crazy um okay so i'm going to like just go ahead and start um and it little early but wanna knock it out 'cause have some other stuff to do today um yeah i'm first i'm tired um but anyways it was like 'cause was like doing homework and stuff yesterday and then like the [laundry] was [inaudible] it was whatever and woke up like dumb-early to go to church um went to church with like my dad family it was cool it was just like dull like it hour [just plus away] so like and then got back to campus late 'cause had meeting and after that to work at um for some event got there kinda late and it was like the en there wasn't anything for me to do so just went to sleep [laughter] not really [though guess] was asleep for like five hour today so i'm probably gonna be uh doing work today um went to office hour for [calc] somewhat productive not really but i'll just stay up and grind tonight um and then try my best to just keep pushing keep going um you know [inaudible] uh it going well only have one class tuesday so that should be straight today was just killer like it was my day off so tried to like put myself in position where like wouldn't be struggling for the rest of the week 'cause do have midterms coming up so um went to the gym office hours um just started grinding on chemistry like got like 30 pages out of the practice [round] book done uh have one more question to do and there was like certain question didn't know how to do so had to go to office hours so can get those but yeah it was just it was lot like crazy uh went to devotion to do do some of the work with some friends so those was like helpful and very productive uh had meeting with my math professor um yeah [inaudible] my uncle came to see me uh had devotion class bible study yeah but i'm gonna sleep in tomorrow 'cause [inaudible] today was pretty okay day um slept in it was great 'cause didn't have class till 800 um [inaudible] just coming from four-day

productive was doing all weekend so think i'm in okayish space just don't know i'm confused but i'm here for better or for worse um today was just long and it probably going to get even longer but already know my [inaudible] was pretty bad um woke up kind of motivated but also very confused but that another story got up um went from class to class to class that was interesting it was tiring um and then after that uh went to bible study that was cool and the people was really nice and engaging but it was just like it was long so um but feel it was worth it at the end of the day just got like whole bunch of other stuff like have to do tonight but good thing is don't have class till 1100 so should be straight um i'm okay just tired and little worried about midterms mostly just my [inaudible] so midterms kind of figured out know what wanted to concentrate in yeah but um yeah just thinking about the hours really is [inaudible] the presentation on ours is like really interesting about like taking like not just like the actual album but like the context of it and also um uh undergrad research expo and there like my upperclassmen who is [already] you know who is close so i'm gonna ask them about [inaudible] i'll probably [shoot them an inbox] tonight so yeah it should be nice today is don't know it wasn't even supposed to be that hard but it just became ridiculous got caught up bible study got caught up um my friend we were doing like 'cause like have both chemistry and math with her it just like but she also like pretty talkative and so it were just like it took lot of time too so i'm probably gonna be up for like another hour-ish but um knocked out lot of work it were just like and things is kinda looking up where like i'm kind of thinking like mentally mental health it is kinda better um got midterm this week need to what really need to be studying for but yeah yeah it the small stuff that started like making sense now but yeah i'm just i'm here i'm just hoping for the best [you know what mean] that really all can do now all right so today was just one of those days it wasn't even like bad days um just like it was one just like lot of work and

check them tomorrow um had to pack for trip this weekend went to church um went to class was in class we was doing sets for most of the day then had my seminar and didn't get back till like 530 then went to church then went to the gym well went to the gym and then church so i've been like moving all day tomorrow probably gonna be the same so i'm probably gonna have to hit the gym in the morning and then um class and then office hours and don't know tomorrow gonna be like the [inaudible] but i'm making it so far i'm surviving not thriving but i'm trying to get to [inaudible] hopefully sooner rather than later today was grind woke up later than should have was just tired and was just going through stuff um but yeah went from class to office hours to working um research [paper] and then from there [laughter] yeah just had to like get stuff ready 'cause i'm leaving for [redacted] tomorrow i'm mostly ready and packed [and whatever] and i'm done like with math homework and my bio homework i'm ahead i've already done my response for [inaudible] i'm ahead of work but still have like more stuff need to get done before go so that way won't miss uh that much while i'm gone yeah i'm still [inaudible] still lot have left to do today especially today i've only been up for like what 11 hours don't plan to be up extremely much longer well probably till like 200 in the morning so that one bad part [just have tomorrow] so just gonna be in like hyper-drive until um hyper-drive basically until harvard-yalethanksgiving yeah well today was another day um went to bed late because had to check one of my friends who having an emergency and that made me wake up late class had already started by the time got up was able to like get there [inaudible] before like was only like 10 minutes late and managed to like do like the little [inaudible] thing so it wasn't that bad um and after that was just like extremely tired was also going on trip to [redacted] for conference but ended up not going to it and none of my friends went because it all realized it had midterms to send [inaudible] so yeah that just seemed like the move instead um so i'm probably going to do that tomorrow [inaudible] like just legit slept like for most of the day watched tv chilled um um because like have an extra energy now i'm going to go ahead and like do an work try and knock an stuff out nothing too strenuous and then tomorrow try to focus and then mean [inaudible] hung out with an friends [inaudible] she [inaudible] this weekend you know kind of feel bad like because i'm missing her and stuff and the conference was like three or four of my friends [inaudible] going either so don't know we'll see what other opportunities come up further down the line yeah so today was interesting [inaudible] like interesting [inaudible] the fact that did nothing um woke up at like 100 in the afternoon come to bed like dumb late but that another story um yeah um yeah prayed went to the gym and started on [inaudible] like i'm relearning like everything from like the past month of bio and like it was lot to like process and take in at one time but feel like it was kind of worth it like me not going to penn for [inaudible] conferences weekend because like wouldn't have had time to do any of that like read like all the stuff in the book like from the pre-readings that like haven't been doing before because like it wasn't as important when we was doing chem but now it bio it like way different so did that um went over like practice runs notes homework went from there to do my mock exam didn't do great but like can see where was doing great so hopefully can improve on that and learn from them before the extra test for that the test is wednesday but like know the content now [inaudible] straight uh today went from good to just exhausting but it was guess better than the alternative woke up went church came back had meeting [inaudible] leadership assistant it was pretty cool ate um uh took nap like two-hour nap [inaudible] like mock exam didn't do great [inaudible] better than should have [inaudible] it pretty much hard doing all the mock [inaudible] um [inaudible] like 1130 630 to 1130 um [inaudible] my room [inaudible] go to sleep so can like be in hurry for [inaudible] the weekend but yeah [inaudible] hopefully everything works itself out just got to keep running for week [inaudible] today was straight guess more or less woke up was pretty well rested went to class counseling um did lot of homework went to an event for like the spirit week or whatever office hours study break study [jam] for bio test wednesday feel [bad] about it not really feel okay about it i'm not really [that well] prepared but feel decent um yeah [i'm more] two big things [one in my personal life] came up that honestly don't know how to address i'm hoping that like over thanksgiving i'll have more time to think and more time to act on whatever is going on just don't know i'm gonna try to push them to the back of my head so can focus today was okay managed to wake up and go to the gym lab we didn't have lab today so that was nice [inaudible] conference call but that kind of took lot of time it like diversity [inaudible] thing it took lot of time too wish had done some other stuff [inaudible] for friend um probably gonna study for like hour-ish because have midterm tomorrow like 830 that really need to at least get some on so hopefully that works out personal life straight realize that like i'm in class for almost 17 hours week doing my seminar and the fact that like i'm some [lpsa] in math and it both have sessions and workshops so um that shouldn't be problem next semester but yeah it just like lot to deal with i'm [inaudible] seven days so at least [inaudible] be able to sleep and stuff and yeah did the [inaudible] midterm and this paper here that i've only written out of 10 pages [inaudible] there some other stuff in my personal life that i'm not really [inaudible] certain about what to do but hoping to figure it out um today was like non-stop grind but i've gotten through wednesday i've just gotta grind through tomorrow and uh tomorrow gonna be some trash [laughter] but yeah go to sleep i'll probably take nap tomorrow [starting to] get little better but had midterm midterm went to class one class another class after office hours hit the gym ate and talked with friend for couple of like some hours that was nice [inaudible] catch up [inaudible] [minute] um closed one of the chapters about my personal life that was bothering me so that good so the other one still kind of open don't really know what to do with that um midterm in the morning at like 500 hopefully i'm really really hoping do well in the it was straight just have to like there nothing can do now just like feel relatively confident about most of it [laughter] there was like two or three questions that was kind of iffy most of the stuff studied was on there um have another midterm tomorrow like knocked out like four or five pages something like five pages in 10-page to-10 pages paper so just have to like fill in the gaps [inaudible] tomorrow so hopefully should be able to like get some stuff going good yeah um [inaudible] tomorrow [inaudible] yeah yeah um today was day woke up [moosehead riding] center um class uh really started [laughter] [inaudible] which is lucky because they started [inaudible] you know they like workshop an-and took my exam for maths they was every single person talked to afterward said they was bad didn't think they was terrible didn't get answer for [laughter] for one of the questions and then another one like set they up right but gr drew the graph wrong or whatever so hopefully mean don't know they depends on like how they grade they but think know didn't do don't know just have to wait and see and then get my chem my bio um score back tomorrow felt uh good about they when took they there was like one that wasn't really sure about and they was something that was forgot but yeah i'm hoping that hopefully got that right um besides that i've really been chilling you know watching tv [laughter] since uh got out [of] my midterm which is just low-key say cause wanna like get some stuff done on my essay and then like um have to pack cause i'm only here tomorrow and then have some ethn have [piece there] for bio to do uh don't know have to figure all that out should be straight though yeah so yeah other than that i'm here mostly for better or for worse should be straight by the weekend especially before thanksgiving today was kind of weird guess don't know it was straight i've went to class got us um grade back on my midterm it wasn't very good it wasn't bad either just have to keep my don't really know what to do after that but just another story um i'm tried to get my sets done before went off to [redacted] it was cool on the way the trip here it was like pretty fun not like out of control but it was okay guess it said the other buses really wasn't fun but that whatever got here i've been chilling with couple friends since um yeah [they said another party really have fun] but just don't like going to kick back 'cause i'm like feel like exploring and just talking to people but yeah don't know we'll see so went to some of the party but it was straight and there nothing like out of the ordinary like and lot of people just said it was trash so we'll see hmm so today was an experience um enjoyed it though it was probably worth it like the bulk of it you know um and woke up late like called friend we got breakfast and we cut the front of the line to get to [redacted] from [redacted] so that was nice and we got there just chilling it was good like was with people we couldn't find the black tailgate so we spent like long time looking for it that whatever um we eventually did find it did but like it was already late and the game was started so just like stayed for little bit got an grabbed like half sa like sandwich without anything in it you know went from there to um the game the game was okay we got blown out terribly but yeah um was sitting by myself like second quarter and my friend came and uh we was talking like during half time and then like lot of people came by it was nice [inaudible] like lot closer to people and stuff or whatever then another one of my friend who i'm like [actually] cool with like he was telling me how like he was really wanted to leave and go home like today instead waited till tomorrow like 'cause nothing went on at [redacted] right now besides like the black talent show which is like that happens like almost every weekend here so it like whatever so that happened then um yeah so instead we just [inaudible] [up] like we both like just took shuttle back to [redacted] got my stuff and like left but the thing is like there no [service] at [redacted] and they're like um my room my host had like locked the door so like that was struggle so called security and it figured it out we got there [around] the show we still do different show 'cause like he got it before me 'cause didn't get my stuff but it was cool we got here uh and then we ordered pizza watched the game the celtics game it won so that was nice think like the biggest thing was just like and then we watched snl and like tried to do an work we was very unproductive but think it was enjoyed the fact that i'm like with people throughout like the whole weekend and just like enjoy that aspect of it yeah [inaudible] [showed me] me like people who i'm cool with still have my own like [inaudible] personal battles stuff that kinda i've brought to my group don't know [inaudible] maybe these will be part of the answer or the solution hopefully it is today was gri well was gonna say it was grind but it was actually pretty good like um woke up went to church came back kinda late but it was [great] [inaudible] to get food then started on my essay gym came back some more of the essay had ate showered went to office hours and was like it didn't the sets for this week weren't that bad because like we kne it knew that we would be at [redacted] which was like amazing [laughter] [and i'm glad] so it didn't take that long to like check and compare with people at the mpc and stuff so and it only took like two hours instead of like usually it kinda like four or five um okay and then after that like just got to chill with people and was still like was just like typing away at my essay so have like one paragraph left and like some housekeeping stuff to do and then i'll be able to go to sleep have two classes tomorrow and then oh have interview tomorrow i'm not gonna prepare for it but just need to like think about it so that it [who straight] just gotta keep pushing so leave tuesday already took my midterms and the only thing was worried about was the essay but only have one paragraph left so i'm in good shape today was pretty productive um well there was lot of down moments but [it was lot] it was pretty productive guess um yeah went to class actually woke up early [accidentally] got breakfast for the first time like since oc-oc september yeah uh class went to different section so could get that out of the way and then went to the [peggy center] it was like extremely helpful just like reframing and organizing my you know my essay but it was in pretty good shape now but also gonna get read like from my professor that could just turn in rough draft hopefully like three to maybe even five more time before turn it in but like don't really have much work in that class i'm in if i'm gonna have somewhat relax because i'm not working thanksgiving break so can have like some more mental space like don't know uh um yeah my flight tomorrow so gotta make sure make that um have to just keep pushing and grinding 'cause wanted to work out like the first thing [that had been bothering me] other than that said it was three thing the first one fixed the second one fixed today it wasn't necessarily positive or like how expected or wanted it but and can't really stress about that anymore which is nice and then besides that just another thing that is whatever been dealing with that for like year now so [it'll be] straight um had interview went to the design lab yeah started on some homework probably just gonna pack and then go to sleep tonight but um today was good in the sense that like pushed through and guess that really all can and all need to do to focus anyway today was pretty decent day ups and downs um so woke ups kind of late but it was straight or whatever and just ate and then after that went on to get some business done with my dad it was really [cool] or whatever we was out for like three hours it was chill don't know it was cool though uh we talked or whatever and then after that came back home got some more business done not too much though then after that i'm probably gonna watch tv for like while 'cause deserve it and yeah maybe even tomorrow [inaudible] was supposed to pull ups on me today [inaudible] be happening but it was don't know felt low just little bit and somebody like tried to come pick me ups but like didn't [inaudible] so it was whatever don't know probably just friday i'll try to do something before go home mean back to my room yeah it i'm fine or whatever um today was kind of uneventful mean came across some money so bought myself some stuff some shoes [inaudible] [laughter] um went to thanksgiving dinner uh it was cool or whatever like getting to see people 'cause like lot has changed in my family since i've been gone and came back home um [inaudible] and i'm probably just gonna watch tv [it early] in the morning some people watch [inaudible] friday but hey my finances are in order and made like wishlist for myself and stuff need to buy myself by december when get my money right but yeah um till then i'm just continuing to push and strive all that um don't know some personal stuff like came up not really even came up just like are on my mind and really don't know how to process it has counseling on monday though so that should be helpful but yeah [inaudible] i'm just gonna keep watching tv good night today was kind of interesting like woke up went went to hang out with some old friends from high school but like don't know didn't really didn't do much but just like being able to catch up with them and talk to them and see them before went back home mean went back to [redacted] pretty cool mean like appreciated it um kind of tired and didn't work out and uh have paper to write by the way only ate once all day but guess enjoyed the [conversation] and to be hanging out with them and just talk to some old friends um yeah and then another one of my friends like pulled up to my house and like we was just like riding in circles around my neighborhood and talking but like don't know just have lot on my mind lot to do but i'm here that what matters um today was kinda weird day uh went to bed last night kinda late just yeah so there was like situation with an old friend that had to hash out and woke up kinda late but would be able to catch my flight like just in time got back to campus at like 1000 uh slept for about like five hours which like desperately needed uh mostly still kinda tired um i'm being honest with myself i'm probably gonna knock out an probably gonna even knock out an homework to move working on my paper till tomorrow [inaudible] my professor to like prove the topic anyway did an laundry uh watched the celtics game oh yeah and alabama lost so like oh [inaudible] the universe well yeah an personal stuff is coming up and like don't know enjoyed like being able to hang out with my friend yesterday [inaudible] was worried was and i'm glad was able to like be there um yeah today been kind of like lazy day but need to get back on my grind at least for this last week of classes and stuff from my personal life will continue to be there [inaudible] there counseling on monday so kinda looking forward today was don't know it was pretty lazy day actually [inaudible] but um woke up went to the gym ate breakfast with friends uh went to church got lost uh like it was so bad like [inaudible] basically like four hours of my day like findi because can't get ride there so just finding ou-out how to get there and then like actually going [inaudible] um but yeah and then after that haven't really done much like school work because was kind of ahead because did some work last night but don't know i'm probably gonna push back the one thing could have done today until like tomorrow and just get some sleep because i'm tired up at 900 am um other than that [inaudible] earlier there like three thing [inaudible] in my personal life kind of eh one of them just gone now can't remember what it is um another one came back don't really know what to do with it but we're here and last one i'm just gonna like let it go like and just not even like it done and it going in circles it not gonna do anything for me [inaudible] other thing had to buy new bag like it ripped so i'm gonna like try to get warranty on that [inaudible] uh like broke the edge of one of my other pairs of glasses uh the nicer pairs but have warranty on it but like [inaudible] tell my dad but just fessed up and told them today um so hopefully can get that replaced over break yeah and hopefully like small size but yeah don't know it not terrible [inaudible] and also like can't get [inaudible] over break today was don't don't even know it was weird don't even like it like had everything together and everything fell apart came back together it was just weird went to class went to the gym knocked everything out later at the end of the day started on homework would watch little bit of tv um oh went to like the research study that took like way longer than thought it should have and then from there went to [bnf] meeting it was productive meeting but didn't really say much what good bro and then like after that like um went to go finish my math set and put something down [also] [inaudible] was talking about my biology set but it didn't really do much don't know i'm not really am uh that inspired kind of in the ruts don't know really don't why and the discussion was about mental health and it was like today at like the meeting with my counselor asked her went to the gym it was like it was helpful but to the extent that like i'm removed from the situation now so it can't really bother me no matter how much try to let it or how much other people try to force it to which guess is relieving but just have to like deal with that and grow in it also got hit with lot of like work oh yes the school also found [inaudible] feels like have seven-page paper for my seminar probably gonna start tomorrow after get my topic reapproved by my professor then after that math got 75 on pre-final which like on one level yeah have to retake it but it also like how bad am doing in the class 'cause everybody said it was bad it was like don't know also have quiz in there tomorrow that need to study for 'cause i've never learned uh logarithms before like i'm gonna try to knock that out tonight and there that and my [ex-law] teacher like wrote my essay completely wrong but was like was hella confident about it so that also kinda and then don't really know what going in you know [bsa] so all that together um kinda messing with my head in that like the mental aspect it just lot going on [i'll] have three weeks to figure it out today was okay guess like last night like had lot lot of school stuff on my mind [inaudible] really no problem with it it just on my mind and [inaudible] how to deal with it but it whatever uh it good thing guess for now just there like lot of different aspects to it um school woke up this morning was supposed to go to the gym but decided not to and just like stretch 'cause was sore anyway and like [inaudible] much for the rest of the week so might as well just go to the gym like not have like two back to back rest days later on um today went to class had quiz so i've missed couple but not that many then had lab [inaudible] lab went pretty okay and after like maybe five or six attempts finally got my [inaudible] approved for my paper so i'm probably gonna finish that up tonight so like can at least like knock one of the thing off on my never-ending list of thing have to do to get my life together before end of the semester but i'm here today was okay um it was kind of hustle had three classes one of them [inaudible] from like three hours to one hours which was nice still kind of fell asleep which is whatever um had some quick meetings took nap hit the gym ate with [inaudible] at wing night and like i've consolidated like all my other homework to like the other parts of the week or did them already so tonight i'm going to put in like three to five hours on my essay for [inaudible] so can have draft worthy of reading tomorrow and so can have another draft ready for friday it vicious cycle but i'm not as overwhelmed as was like earlier on in the week probably could have [inaudible] somewhat through it so keep pushing and like tonight is crucial so hopefully i'll be able to push through just keep going um emotionally and socially guess things is straight um [stupid] things on my mind that haven't really decided what to do about yet but just have to see um don't know today was good day got lot of stuff done it was extremely productive also extremely stressful and it was like [inaudible] like [inaudible] paper [inaudible] right make revisions mean [inaudible] input on [inaudible] section all that and then went made the revisions started on [inaudible] [inaudible] and then after that um the gym finished making that revisions headed [inaudible] compared to the answers to my own uh psats for math and bio i'm gonna go help friend with that [inaudible] i'm tired the only thing left have to do is like compose like three pages of paper for seminar so [inaudible] don't know i'm tired got lot done and should be no reason why stay up really late tonight besides like if want to watch tv or something [inaudible] today was pretty decent guess woke up extremely tired that 'cause went to sleep late 'cause was um was supposed to be doing work but then started watching tv like wanted needed break but that happened went to class knocked all that out took like short reco [got like what to do] for reading period so that was cool whatever and like after that um oh yeah fell asleep and took nap and then like woke back up and then after that uh oh yeah hit the gym and then went with my um seminar to my professor house in [redacted] it was pretty cool actually not really what expected [laughter] um yeah and then after that came back to my [dorm room] and was gonna knock some stuff out before this weekend so can like have more time to chill hopefully yeah it was pretty cool um today was okay guess woke up at like 100 in the afternoon grabbed some food feel like haven't honestly done anything since that watched lot of [redacted] did some pre-reviewing for bio probably gonna do most of my actual work tomorrow 'cause feel like i'm not gonna be very productive for the rest of the day [i'll] like try to go to bed at like 1200 [inaudible] rest couple hours [then i'll] be up so don't know today was straight i'm just sleepysluggish but also like like went to one of my friend concerts there is that too yeah sleepysluggishnot exactly that motivated to do anything [laughter] it like well like for some stuff [inaudible] just like thinking about [inaudible] bothered me but it it better today was overall good day but it hasn't really started [laughter] like woke up kinda early [to] church came back had my interview for my job oh i'm trying to get job like like most people here got some really good news got somebody interested in my [bothos] shoes that was trying to sell so [i'm able to settle up little] i'll be like in great shape financially [laughter] for next semester and then like realized can probably pick up job but like nee not [pick up] like five hours week that nothing serious um so yeah just that took nap hit the gym hung out with like my big brother um but yeah didn't realize how much we had in common like he really dope he like he bit wilder than me but thought he good people [laughter] um but yeah and then [i waste like all the weird time] like throughout the day but don't have class tomorrow but i'm still gonna wake up and like go to like review sessions and stuff have to sit down and plan out how i'm going to spend these two week 'cause already know they're gonna come and go so yeah i'm taking math mock exam 'cause like we have one due tuesday so i'm gonna just take that so can like yeah just know what i'm doing going forward need to sit down and plan maybe watch tv or something yeah it was straight um woke up my bad went to the review session and then uh went to like clinic for paper gotta write for expos and then after that just [i really chill] went to the [inaudible] gotta make an appointment to [like finishing up plans] for the week ended up coming back home and like do an more study for lps but like feel like i'm gonna grind harder throughout the remainder of the week and have like one-on-one meetings with all my section tf and my teacher and like i'm meetings with my math teacher like every day i'm done with my seminar paper the only thing is like my [inaudible] paper gotta make sure like [i'm still like getting somebody to look at it] but should be able to like don't know [inaudible] but guess i'm gonna just email my [inaudible] make sure like all that checked out everything else was straight after that went to like went to the celtics and bucks game it pretty good game like an friends came that was nice but yeah i've been [chilling] i'm making it so far um today was kinda weird so like woke up kinda late went to review session and like as soon as came back just planning to like take like 10-minute nap it ended up being like three three and half hours so from there had to go like [inaudible] actually calculated my grades they're not terrible have like minuses so hopefully like if need as in my midterm can get as in the class but yeah [inaudible] as far as that go um so hopefully don't know [inaudible] uh it will significantly help my mental health financially got job for hsa uh then me and my big bro at bmf we had talk about like goldman so that was nice and then like i'm gonna play the lead on conference call so she told me to email her to get her email from the coordinator of the conference call but it'll be straight yeah don't really know what i'm doing this summer oh and then worked on my expos essay like lightbulb being turned on that was great it way too long it was great and my proctor gave me some food so life good guess so um today was okay mean woke up on time right to um have uh [redacted] brief me on my [inaudible] we went over some things it was pretty cool went to math review chem review so just kinda like hung out with friends and stuff and then iike forget what but just like had stuff to do uh like classroom [inaudible] and like think my math teacher we was supposed to have meeting but like it didn't really come together it like got there like 10 minutes late and then he wasn't there but feel like he forgot about it but it whatever it probably better that way anyway and then after that started like more essay revisions 'cause like had writing center tutor reading it for me 'cause like their it it had appointments this week but it was like few and far between so made that um he said he was gonna read it again tonight there couple more things for me to change and then i'ma have really don't know who could have read it but yeah probably one of my high school lit teacher but it like it need it back in day um so there that ah i'm probably going to start oh yeah when got back took went to the gym ate and then like came back and went to sleep am supposed to be doing work [inaudible] don't know why watched tv for like 30 minutes and then went to sleep it whatever though um took like two-hour nap so i'll go to bed at like 100-ish to make up for it so i've been out so if get like two more hours of like study in should be good uh today was was an okay day kind of busy day because just had like lot of appointments and lot of things to get done it was somewhat productive beginning of the day but then like kinda dissipated um tomorrow morning looks little busy too but yeah don't know all right i'm going to bed like extremely late because was up on the phone with like friend and then hung out with somebody else like it like don't know there is always [inaudible] like connect with people like for so long if that makes sense um have presentation for seminar today and like my [inaudible] paper due tomorrow by 500 still can [inaudible] like um can ask for an extension but if it don't let me use it went back and just like streamlined the thesis and the topic sentences and stuff made sure everything flowed uh feel like everybody should be happy with it it pretty good it seen like what almost seven different reviews so i'm just hoping that because really need so have to get get on my paper but really need one so probably in an hour or so um today was somewhat busy but okay day guess um i'm tired 'cause went to bed like late yesterday but [inaudible] think it was worth it it was like being able to talk through stuff you know yeah and then today was like doing math and like little bit of chem like from 900 to 1200 and came back went to the gym went to shadowing for my job and then came back ate and took nap and then went to like bible study from like 800 to 1000 now i'm faced with this [inaudible] should try to go harder on chem should try to like watch tv or should just go to sleep all of those are calling my name so i'll probably end up trying to do little of each yeah so we'll see uh today was it was weird day [inaudible] everything so [inaudible] um besides that uh woke up at like 100 130-ish which is nice needed like that 12 hours of sleep um so that happened and then one of my friends came and got me from my room to hang out [inaudible] two hours of my day don't really know [inaudible] today kind of bit stressful for me um so that happened and then went to the gym ate started studying was able to get through like all of the lecture notes [inaudible] because that really where my weakness is and still have to take mock besides that don't know really kinda confused with everything that like it been bothering me so that always good thing i'm not broke boy anymore um had offers for two [inaudible] had [inaudible] trying to get them to follow [inaudible] but besides that straight so today was it was day not necessarily better but oh yeah don't don't know woke up went to church that was nice exactly what need to hear get me fired up [for whatever] was tired though [laughter] um and then after that had meeting with my math [tutor] and just went over stuff and after that happened uh hung out with friend 'cause she was leaving today and we was just chilling playing ukulele it was nice [inaudible] and then uh went to the gym [around 800] and after that [was like] and after that just broke down um math mock it was way too long [laughter] just finished it oh and graded my uh my um my bio mock got 70 but like have week to study so there another mock [she] gave myself with so hopefully can get pull at least like highish um gonna need the [that what] [inaudible] [huh] 'cause we've got finals uh and then two two things [inaudible] my personal life like back home [i'm surrounded] in like don't really know what to do about it though like don't know [life's] always in pieces but yeah literally it just like don't really know what to do it tough decision just wanna do the best things for everybody involved beside that it was good day should be able to go to bed like 1230-ish so that all straight so today was don't know busy day say that lot uh uh mostly nothing really happened in my personal life don't know don't know what i've been doing honestly just went to like review session [with my math tf] for like 30 minutes today [inaudible] study session so got through one of the [inaudible] um i've been going into turn on the gears and grind little bit for [inaudible] the essay so [inaudible] exam on friday and saturday i'm chilling not too stressed so [inaudible] working uh and i'm here this week really just gonna be it gonna be week uh we'll see um today was like [wasn't that prod a] pretty lazy day didn't wake up until 1000 [laughter] went to the gym had lunch with friend went to office hours but we didn't really end up doing much so then after that um went to the [mock math] but it was like actually proctored and like in the room that we're gonna take it so that was nice but it was universally hard and everybody felt [they did bad] and like that was out of 40 people out of like the 150 that take it and that 40 people are the ones who are like really passionate about it and like actually good at the class so kinda feel bad 'cause didn't know how to do lot of it but don't feel terrible 'cause [they] didn't either we'll go over it with math [tf] tomorrow in the morning and then ate went to bible study for second the last last time i'm gonna be going to church or that church until get back home [and me and] [redacted] get back from winter break for like month then after that um borrowed my friend bio textbook so could like actually read like the the three last topics like since the last midterm 'cause it was the areas i'm stud i'm struggling because haven't been studying them as hard [as if had midterm on them] understand them now more or less so um uh gotta do like [quick-ish] review should be in bed by like 1200-ish gotta wake up at 800 well at 800 but 830 probably but yeah today was an okay day guess um kinda disappointing but not really don't know being little dramatic um woke up went over parts of the mock exam with my math tf then went to the gym ate and stuff chilled for little bit and then went to um had like [inaudible] phone call like stuff over the summer don't know this is guy from [goldman] but he says he not really sure put in an app anyway maybe it can turn around to something positive not too sure says he don't hire freshmen did one for merck as well so don't know maybe i'll get that uh from pharmaceutical um then went to the the review for math which realized i'm not as bad as thought was like there still [inaudible] things here and there like i'm learning guess just shouldn't have given up so easy on the last problem and had like hour left so feel like couple of bathroom breaks like just clearing my head up and hopefully [inaudible] would've been able to get to it chem slash bio took another mock was surprised at how much didn't know which is good because like it not the actual test but uh [inaudible] review session before [that] um i'm hoping it all works out i'll take saturday morning so today was an okay day guess woke up extremely early 'cause my friends are annoying uh we had like review session that only lasted about like 30 minutes and then we dispersed um then was at work then went to um the gym uh chilled for little bit did little bit of studying for chem and then after that went to my math tf we talked for little bit then went to the chem office was just like made sure got everything straight it was extremely helpful came back home um to my dorm watched like two hours of tv uh somehow it 1030 and like still need to like do like an last minutes reviewing for math it not really that bad 'cause realize like kinda know everything just make sure apply it and like take my time and read stuff so yeah at the end of the day things are falling into place just gotta make sure perform appropriately and hope do well in my ter mid terms i've been studying lot so been this way so kinda tense today was an okay day uh well knocked out my math final you know so have another final tomorrow morning so uh this is there um feel like i'm adequately prepared um i'm just gonna run through my day guess so um woke up hit the gym last time i'm gonna be going until like we get back in january then went to reviewed like tried to study and like

um help one of my friends apply for um duke like it was her dream school so yeah might as well and then came back home uh friends from harvard facetimed me uh that was nice so i'm probably just gonna be chilling first mean should should honestly be going to bed soon [laughter] but yeah i'm in more or less good mood just have to figure out what i'm doing with my life and how to make everything work out so it you know yeah life all that so we shall see and [let me see] oh and realized like i'm in the same position as like all that people who was like who was comparing myself to [regarding] like grade-wise so really shouldn't be stressing but anyway yeah that it and yeah that it um today was yet another it was day um huh whatever happened woke up like really late and then worked out and really didn't do much after that i've just been on my phone talking to people and went to bible study we have that pretty late like we really like just got back um and then some friends wanted me to revise their papers like [inaudible] their essays and stuff so i'm gonna like do that for minute probably like some hour and then try to go to sleep uh i'm relatively good oh my grades came back uh knew for my gpa came back not my actual grades so it shows that have 367 which means got three minuses which isn't bad it just like [inaudible] feel like deserve better but at the same time it like it it is harvard so 37 with straight as isn't that bad so don't know i'll try to grind harder and do better later today was hmm it was okay it was actually fairly good guess um went to school [inaudible] high school and went to go visit one of my old teachers popped up and surprised her like the new job mean it wasn't much of surprise [laughter] but yeah it was good getting to see everybody again it kind of touched my heart little bit um so did [inaudible] first think about but some people [inaudible] but it was really bad he was just like you need to stop [partying] and like other stupid stuff and all that jazz don't know i'm in relatively good mood i'm gonna check my grades in minute had two minuses when checked earlier i'm waiting on my last grades today was it was another day necessarily good or bad um um actually [inaudible] or practice driving ran some errands with my dad came back um worked out watched movie haven't done much since then probably should start being productive but yeah not really done that much but got to catch up with people and all that so that was nice guess um yeah i've just been chilling i'm about to do the dishes and attempt to be productive for like the last couple of hours i'm gonna be up then yeah [inaudible] from there uh my grades finally came back ended up with 38 this semester so don't know got in the class was doing the worst in all semester so that good surprise so got minus in the ones was actually doing good in so don't know but then it like it weird 'cause did like got on my [x files] like final term paper and that was 40 of my grades so it like like in the grades book it shows have 95 but it says got minus in the class which is like tad discouraging but it all good like guess um yeah we're just out here grinding and all that do better next semester and just keep pushing so today was it was pretty okay day nothing out of the ordinary um woke up at like 1200 [laughter] my aunt dropped off something for me and i've been like chilling or being like medium productive [laughter] um after that don't know worked out and then my um yeah really haven't done anything like at all [laughter] which is great but probably need to go to bed in like an hour-ish that what i'm trying to do it now um yeah got my life in order reset my phone it started working uh right now it not but don't really know if it just like 'cause like don't legit don't have service or if it like 'cause it going in and out but we'll see so that kind of hurdle [laughter] um and got my finances like guess kind of settled so i'm in good-ish space just need to keep pushing we'll see today once again was day don't know ended up going to bed at 200 then woke up to go to church um today is christmas eve so that was that was pretty much the message of the sermon and then from there we came home started getting stuff ready for like for the dinner that we was hosting at my house um the people came we exchanged gifts um and then worked out like in between like getting ready and like the dinner being served was just doing push-ups and sit-ups and then don't know started doing dishes then fell asleep i've been up since then want to get my survey so i'm gonna come back and do the dishes and then after that [inaudible] still have to pack i'm running out of time but yeah it was another day guess woke up um started packing for this trip to south carolina um [like it got a] party headed over here got here around 700-ish ate dinner and and that was it um don't know [got lots on] my mind particularly like school is starting to get to me i'm also extremely tired and yeah don't know talked to like lots of familyfriends today [it mostly like] family uh [some] relationship with friends that need to at least consider think about or do something about it and then my finances [aren't] in order either so mean need to [inaudible] need the new [inaudible] but [however want new] [inaudible] if that makes sense so i'll probably figure all that out in the morning just started watching the game and this movie started on netflix 'cause am on vacation for reason i'm doing good i'm just tired lots on my mind um today was another uh day guess um nothing really too pr-pro-pro-productive or crazy but feel like to to went to walmart like [inaudible] others and then like after that we ate and like was asleep in the car and [inaudible] laughing up bit hit the gym came back watched part of the game and started going through um through stuff need to do and [inaudible] productive thought up the solution to my phone problem well thought of like two solution hopefully like one of them works [inaudible] something to like help me [over] until the next time [inaudible] i'll probably be late but late is [inaudible] getting [inaudible] like uh uh [back] already so there that started [inaudible] coming down with the cold uh emotionally um i'm still upset so it [inaudible] that but don't know yeah 'cause some of my problem seem [inaudible] today but we'll see but yeah it good day it just like didn't really do much today was another okay-ish day guess did not really do much uh yeah [it was] it was bad [laughter] uh we we woke up we didn't do anything for like hours and then we're like okay let go [laughter] and then we went [to the outlet] but didn't buy anything saw like one thing liked but didn't end up buying it [they gave out some] [inaudible] um just looked at pictures that you know like price [inaudible] [really don't like need um but didn't have uh like money] um besides that started movie [with the um] then we went out we

friday night so [i suppose it] thing will get better eventually today was good day more or less don't know didn't really do much um went to the outlet with my family and like uh and then we really didn't do much besides that came back went to the gym um i'm trying to think about what did oh handled some business stuff and then uh was helping friend like with her college apps so like looking over her and stuff um knocked couple of things out of my to-do list and don't know guess first would be like uh same old same old just some stuff to think about nothing particularly bad or anything but i'm here you know we leave tomorrow so yeah haven't really done much since we got here but yeah um yeah not necessarily bad day or good day i'm just here i'll figure things out um today was another day uh we left south carolina finally um yeah it was pretty good actually all right my parents are so aggravating trip been [laughter] annoying but um figured lot of stuff out stuff out like based on like what need to get done over break was like took steps toward getting that done also like was able to just don't know just like thinking in like bigger picture what was doing next semester and over the summer had friend like who met over the like last summer who said he gonna help me find something to do this summer like he got plugged in like he was able to work with goldman over the summer so that should be nice um but just like figuring out like what i'm gonna do if over break was cool still kind of annoying now that like i'm doing the survey early because like we're gonna be on the road and won't get back home until probably past 1200 based on like the pace we're going but yeah today was don't know it was another day [laughter] um oh first of all my bad about it being like so late know it was like basically the next day [laughter] at this point but forgot like [didn't] get notification that whatever um today was an okay day slept in which is always beautiful thing um woke up prayed worked out was supposed to go get pedicure with my friend but like she didn't reply so ended up just uh taking care of little bit of business and got an good news about like spring break thing that was trying to do so i'll be able to know definitely whether or not i'm going tomorrow um my parents forgot [redacted] today [laughter] didn't really do much uh um watched the [redacted] game set up fire stick in my house [redacted] was asking me to do it like since got home so yeah that happened don't know i'm coming to grips on like mental piece of like everything in my life right now so i'm hoping that like i'll continue to just be able to grow in single year so we'll see what dreams may come today another day went to church was extremely tired we're trying to get our house ready for [a watch night sermon] it was good message then we was with this um nigerian family i'm nigerian too [we all just] [inaudible] you know like we was just with them it was like it was somewhat annoying but also realized like this is what other family did for us so like valued it more so we're getting the house ready um i'm probably gonna do like quick 15-to-20-minute workout 'cause like last time we got home it was already dark um and so that was that couple good things guess through our personal life us and our friend was able to come to conclusion about how to solve like one of the problems was having with someone but don't know that like weight off our chest it was also like us and them is closer now um but yeah i'm going on the acceptance letter is gonna come in by 1200 but i'm just gonna go ahead and do this 'cause i'm not like really staying up past new year just wanna go ahead and like not take care of this so yeah today was another day uh as was saying like before there like family staying with us it was like yeah went to bed damn late had to wake up damn late so that was don't know had to wake up early it was kinda annoying but it was okay guess there lot to do but it not it wasn't terrible um and then just just thinking about like the spring break opportunity [inaudible] oh got accepted to the spring break opportunity that i've been waiting and praying and thinking about for like really long time um so that happened i'm just like i'm glad that got that so keep going on my day the dishes workout and now just watching ball games georgia didn't wanna step forward and watched that closing alabama games where the championship next week is it in [redacted] that probably [inaudible] then um had some other business stuff to handle this week have lot of applications to do for summer stuff so we'll see where it takes [inaudible] but i'm in good space also spent lot of this morning like reading people papers like like last-minute college applications and then like also dealing with stuff that like definitely won't be problem anymore 'cause left them in 2017 so yeah today was it was yet [laughter] another boring slow day it was actually pretty good guess um got some good news from some internship applied to so made it to the last round so um have to figure out how to go [laughter] between now and then it in like three weeks but it great opportunity just have to keep pushing um hung out with my mentor and then like two of her other mentees they're like people went to high school with and like we're pretty close so that was it was pretty cool like being around her um little bit aggravated 'cause like my parents was we was supposed to get news phones 'cause my phones messed up like we was supposed to get her today this was like my christmas present but like still didn't get her yet so yeah there that um supposed to get her tomorrow so yeah we'll we'll see how all that works out um yeah but besides that i'm doing pretty good guess i'm not no complaints for the most part today was it was day it was basically productive but guess it good then woke up at like 800 in the morning to go to my sister doctor appointment which didn't feel like going to and then we didn't do any of the stuff he liked he said he like he told me to wake up so like we'd get other stuff done throughout the day he didn't do any of that so ended up just like wasting whole bunch of time but like was able to do my personal statements so get lot of like stuff for applications to do [inaudible] first up and i'm figuring out like who to ask recommendation letters from and just like start an [inaudible] and stuff um i'm gonna start the cs class so have to prepare for my interview that in like two weeks and there been like lot of like housekeeping stuff i've done it was good besides that it just like busy not really bad though so just one of that day but um besides that things guess are good don't know haven't really had that much time to think hopefully i'm gonna start sleeping better and like just doing better in general but yeah i'm good besides that today was yet another of those days [inaudible] [up] [inaudible] um [inaudible] [done] early 'cause one like only the last of those like related to me so instead just went back to bed so of course he was mad um so those happened and then like we had to clean our house so cleaned [the loft] cleaned two bathrooms washed our stepmom car um now i'm just tired but still have like some stuff need to get done um like [cleaning] [inaudible] [my head] [inaudible] um [inaudible] yeah [inaudible] last night and also i'm just doing this well this is the second [inaudible] [but] don't really know maybe like [inaudible] relog into the account not too sure but yeah um today was yet another one of those days [and i] feel like every single one on break is gonna be until my parents go parents go back to work [and when i] can go so we just go back to school [but didn't really] get those much done um did lot of dishes i'm probably going to have to like do more tonight because more people came over my uncle funeral was today um it was touching but it was like was

for my microsoft interview haven't even started those um didn't work out today now don't know i'm gonna figure it out eventually i'm just one tired two aggravated so yeah nah i'm i'm surviving i'm kinda ready to go back i'm not ready for school though um today was yet another day spent most of the day at church and then at home doing dishes um actually managed to get part of workout in just had to do some sit-ups take shower there actually like reason why [inaudible] so like can go ahead and like at least try to start the coding stuff and was able to pick couple of friends up like metaphorically helped them feel better so guess like that good thing uh but i'm doing well besides the fact that caught my sister cold when she was staying in my room because there are too many people in this house i'm glad because [inaudible] don't mean this in like bad way but [inaudible] just like lot of stress [when she came] i'm glad that like get the next couple of day to just like chill and prepare for this interview because have no idea what i'm doing only have like what like 11 day now um yeah and want to see my homies tomorrow but don't really know how to make that move how to make that work um because my dad going to be at work and my stepmom she don't have work but don't really know what she doing because like it supposed to be like icy road conditions [inaudible] also like the middle like the college football [inaudible] championship like are [inaudible] like at the school go to so don't know how it going to work out at all thought about it haven't really done much like preparing for it so we'll see today was actually good day good day it actually [inaudible] just [inaudible] needed to do um my dad um agreed to let me go to the cultural [inaudible] of the championship 'cause [inaudible] downtown [later] um have cold i'm bit um today was yet another day um need to find better day 'cause these day have not been working recently um so yeah we came back from the [inaudible] championship it was cool um it was nice to be able to hang out with my friends haven't seen them in while um woke up went to the gym and then 'cause stayed the night at their campus [inaudible] so we did that and then left went to the gym took care of some business [inaudible] [breakfast] whatever then left came back home [inaudible] my dad well went with my dad to pick up my little siblings and then we went to go do well wro wrote letter of recommendation to my teacher instead of the other way around but it was it was she probably the best teacher had ever had the pleasure of taking so it was just like it was really touching to be able to do something for them instead of the other way around um so that that happened um the other side of that got really lazy after did that so instead i'm probably just gonna watch movie tonight and like handle like some like email stuff like summer opportunity stuff but like haven't started coding for the project that well for for the internship interview that have next week which is problem have tomorrow and the day after 'cause i'm probably going out friday night so we will see how all that works out yeah [inaudible] it was good day just need to use my time better today was pretty okay day um once again slept in till like noon um started doing some of the coding stuff didn't get lot done but like basics guess um got some work i'm going to try to knock out tonight and then i'm gonna work um but i'm watching tv right now let me do that and then go to sleep was trying to go to bed like relatively early hopefully not later than 200 so like can wake up in time to go um by 930-ish 'cause i'm supposed to go somewhere tomorrow at like 330 um yeah i'm supposed to go to lot of places actually but yeah um have that

this tv show started because like really wanted to watch it but like didn't really have the time had time today because didn't do anything makes me kind of glad went out yesterday instead um yeah i'm chilling i'm good though mentally and physically was worried about the internship interviews like money in general and um kind of had spiritual not breakthrough but like somebody else did [inaudible] and he said he was gonna pass on the information [inaudible] so hopefully all those works out we'll see how it do or doesn't um so uh came back to [redacted] today uh so last night [inaudible] was like kind of thinking about it [inaudible] sleep [inaudible] couldn't sleep so decided to keep watching tv till like an hour before the time was supposed to wake up [inaudible] took powernap and then woke up like three hour later or two hour before my flight was able to catch it but like in the time like made error in judgment you know like like brought like an liquid like an cosmetic stuff that like that obviously tsa throw away but it was like could have easily left it at home because couldn't bring it with me had to buy more anyway but like at least could have had it at home stashed but [inaudible] and then the church got to here it called me and then it picked me up from the airport got ice cream took care of an business not really that much though um continued to watch tv unpacked

glaringly wrong just worried about that um and i'm trying to make sure everything comes together we'll see today was like one of the more stressful days that i've had [laughter] recently probably because i've been on break for so long lot of good things happened lot of bad things happened it not even bad just lot of things have happened um woke up went to work wo well woke up went back to

it thought did they're sort of like great you know it just like don't know it was very it was supportive didn't really see anything that wrong with it um it didn't ask me any like specific like coding questions so don't know if that like good or bad thing but we will see like at the end of the day uh it said we'll find out like next week and then know it don't know like if need to apply to [inaudible] um so yeah that happened that pretty like pretty much all did today so most of people really cool um like made some friends uh had to leave for my flight around 900 930 so went to eat and go back to my hotel to shower and chill watch the game and then [try to] leave so can like be on time for the the flight so have to be back tomorrow for the conference so think everything will work out hopefully we'll just see how this go um today was mainly good day i'm gonna pick up from where last time recorded um mostly tiring though it was good just tiring um so had the interview went pretty well it was kinda weird 'cause it didn't ask me any like specific coding questions but it said all the interviewers said did great and like it wouldn't waste all their money and time flying me out there if like if it was gonna reject me for not taking like formal cs class anyway so we'll see how that works out um after that worked out ate went back to the hotel for while to chill before went to go catch the flight it was red-eye and like while red-eye sound like really great in theory realized like one didn't go immediately to sleep was watching tv for good two hours on flight then after that like you're still losing the three hours in like changing from the west coast to the east coast time so i'm off like about two hours of sleep right now so got back to boston um went to the [inaudible] conference for the club i'm part of um was able to help out little bit took nap while was there for like good like 30 40 minutes um then went to the gym after that i'm probably just gonna head back and chill uh 'cause got works in the morning besides that [inaudible] was kinda anxious about figuring out what gonna [go wrong] with the thing 'cause don't find out for another week so yeah i'm here so um today was surprisingly busy but not necessarily bad um the only other thing had to really do was worry about um um my placement test i'm probably gonna take it tomorrow but realize like don't need to [inaudible] spanish [inaudible] just need to like brush up on the grammar stuff that i've forgotten so i'll probably study too go to church tomorrow then study and [inaudible] so can probably do the best as possible or hit the gym in between that um so yeah still kind of nervous about the internship um interview but started then don't know questioning like my faith and stuff i'm supposed to meet with my professor tomorrow but besides that went to work in the morning then afterward went to go home help with the conference for the [inaudible] [inaudible] it was lot of work but there wasn't [inaudible] that really just [inaudible] me how tired am from the layover of the flights and stuff so gonna go to sleep tonight and was gonna go out friday and saturday but might just like cancel friday and then like make an appearance saturday but not do much so yeah that where we're at right now today was fairly aver-average day um woke up early from reading with my pastor was talking about the last recording uh don't know kinda got like more involved than wanted to but it whatever um some thinking to do and went to the gym ate uh came back and took nap and then uh studied for like my spanish placement then little bit then took it eh it went okay there was some stuff wasn't sure about and then pretty sure missed lot of like the last four questions we'll see [inaudible] like 150 or so questions don't know when get my score back but yeah we'll see um made my schedule more or less so have to figure out like which gen ed i'm gonna take this semester [or] [inaudible] [seminar] so yeah there all that going on but we'll see today was actually like great day um don't know woke up on time went to class um it was like math meeting and then went to like my first class and then um after that went to the gym [inaudible] and then finished working out came back went to work went to counseling [inaudible] don't know it was actually like really good day because got lot of uh stuff done um just like hanging out with people realizing that my friends [inaudible] still kind of lost about like what class i'm going to take but um got past the first round of my spanish placement test so hopefully that work out and don't have to take it at all because have to take like the 45-minute version part in people um so yeah there that so i've just got to get through that um so now [inaudible] [about microsoft] later on in the week so my friends was telling me like some people got rejection letters already hoping that not my lot but we'll see today was pretty good day [inaudible] you know little bit of stuff to do there but yeah so today was good day um nothing out of the ordinary woke up went to work uh got paid extra for one of my shifts but the thing well got overtime for one of my shifts but somebody uh because of that wasn't able to shop one of the classes that wanted to so i'm gonna ask somebody on my floor 'cause he went too so hopefully like it really easy [laughter] 'cause need like an easy fourth classes 'cause i'm taking biochem and math which is gonna come back to bite me in the butt but mean took [inaudible] math and chem last semester and didn't die yeah we'll see um so yeah all that happened and then uh worked out later with somebody in my dorm it was cool whatever like 'cause haven't worked out like with somebody in long time uh uh um and now i'm just kinda all stressing over like the second part of my [inaudible] placement exam have tomorrow and then like 'cause got exactly what needed to get this this far i'm hoping that i'm able to place out and then um i'll find out about the internship well an people already did but i'll find out like at an point throughout this week or so hoping that goes well uh yeah everything pretty much is working out so i'm not worried about that two thing it was overall decent day no complaints so today was um it was relatively uh it actually was good day um so woke up went to the class sp only had one class today 'cause class haven't like officially started yet decided not to take one of the other class was thinking about 'cause it looks like like too much work not lot of work just too much com well like compared to like what i'm thinking about doing kinda finalized my schedule uh it was rest day for working out took my spanish placement test and then did my math set the first one is due friday so at least got that out of the way then i'm going to section for my class tonight um uh yeah it was really all have like going on i'm probably gonna watch tv and chill napped in the middle of the day oh and passed my spanish placement test so don't have to take spanish [laughter] so i'm thankful for that and i'm kinda anxious waiting on like the results from my microsoft interviews 'cause like some more people have started getting theirs it was like it said sometime this week or next week so we'll see what happens hoping for the best um today was good day but feel like i'm still riding the highs of like other day um let me see where do start woke up went to work and then went to class was tired in class but then went back to work picked up some more hours had to cancel my first seminar because like it conflicted like my my mandatory chem class or bio class [inaudible] then went on from that into um yeah picked up some hours so like my check should be like amazing size so there that then went to um like to the gym with friend and after that like went from meeting to meeting to meeting but like kept seeing the same people there it was like it cool because get to like don't know [inaudible] like the people [inaudible] whatever [inaudible] um and then had meeting with my freshman um advisor so he was helpful um appreciate him and feel like i'm gonna roll my class now and just see how life goes so hopefully because like i'm taking [inaudible] i'm taking like my [inaudible] is kind of comparable to what did last semester [inaudible] had to make sure [inaudible] yeah and not get complacent and make sure keep [inaudible] yeah feel like i'm pretty doing pretty well right now [inaudible] finish [inaudible] i'll probably watch movie first

didn't do like two of the things one it was just like well made like routine of things should be doing 'cause like i'm taking three [inaudible] class and two lab class so which think [inaudible] so it shouldn't be that bad especially 'cause like was preparing for test too mean like [inaudible] quiz and have class but [inaudible] i'm just trying to after finish the [inaudible] like wanna like well finish the part was gonna do [oh and was like i'm gonna work on stuff so can] watch tv for like hour yeah and took nap earlier today too but it was like yeah i'm gonna reward myself um but that turned into like two hour 'cause the video kept buffering then hit the gym with my friend ate came back doing my work that what i'm doing right now i'm trying to go to bed early-ish don't have class so um then should probably work out in the morning we'll see how that work out but chilling in good mood just little anxious 'cause um basically it tuesday and have to find out about the internship by thursday so don't know we'll see um today was pretty good day guess [it not good] it was just extremely productive and busy hit the gym and class took like hour break in between and then back to class

decompress tonight hopefully we don't have set tomorrow if we don't have set tomorrow might just like not look at the math stuff right now 'cause i'm low-key tired anyway yeah should probably do that and then hopefully go to sleep i'm still kinda stressed about the internship my friend who applied with me he already found out but another guy hasn't so still have two day to find out [we'll] see how that works out hoping for the best 'cause need to know if should like apply to other stuff so so today was it was day um went to class and then went to section it was really really strange 'cause the guy was like my [inaudible] lectures don't make any sense at all and that happened started my math set actually managed to go through with it because also went to like math camp for like because we have quiz tomorrow after class got most of the problems had questions about and then like finished the homework so i'm going to go to lpc tomorrow very shortly not gonna stay for really long time like usually do [inaudible] go to that and then outside of that um [inaudible] got rejection letter from microsoft so felt bad for like minute like just mean didn't really expect to get in it just like i've been stressing to uh turn around [inaudible] put in about 15 more applications today so guess that the right attitude to have um so yeah that happened really just finished that and then got on the phone with my friend it was her birthday someone back home was supposed to call him tomorrow um probably going to start some set and call it day but yeah [inaudible] so it always blessing [inaudible] in control of some stuff wasn't in control couple weeks ago that always nice day yeah so [inaudible] i'm not tired 'cause of the adrenaline rush adrenaline rush and [inaudible] had so many things to turn in today 'cause they're all due on 31st feeling pretty good uh gonna power through the set hopefully personal life things are looking better just kinda bummed up didn't get to actually secure the microsoft things but it could be okay [inaudible] start with friday too so we'll see what happens um yeah today was actually like really good day surprisingly um woke up like moderately on time got to class moderately on time um but yeah after that got through lecture in class to section to lecture [inaudible] and tha yeah that was officer hours knocked out like all my sets in last night it was like productive so was able to finish everything right before [inaudible] um so [inaudible] and also managed to finish all that applications that was extremely helpful uh got all that done um and then finished took nap woke up and then had gateway like quiz for my math class so then took that was done with that um ri-right now probably just gonna check my math sets 'cause already finished it yesterday at office hours and then go to sleep so should be able to sleep like befa before 1200 so i'm kinda happy about and then probably the same tomorrow so deserve the rest um yeah i'm chilling i'm in pretty good mood i'm salty 'cause didn't get the [inaudible] trying to look into more opportunities and find new stuff to do yeah i'm in good mood though see how everything works out today was day oh you know i'm tired um woke up kinda late probably 'cause stayed up on the phone with my friend but yeah um ended up going to class watched up tv in like the middle of the day and then went to um little startup career fair um but yeah don't know was trying to see if something could pop off but it didn't really seem too likely [inaudible] um put it in the app that was like late so called the ones that was there [inaudible] see what happens with that um but if that [inaudible] possibility which is like going to summer school if can't get an internship so uh that not really what expect or what want but we'll see if that works out then went to review session for ps11 um and then went to the gym and then showered was supposed to like [inaudible] get lot of sleep but went to sleep very we'll see what happens just woke up just wanted to fill this out today was day not necessarily good or bad uh last night stayed up till like 400 like doing applications trying to start homework didn't really get that far 'cause was already tired and like hang out with friends for little bit but um yeah then actually had trouble like waking up the next day for the hackathon had signed up for while ago ended up going but didn't really wanna compete 'cause had other things to do and was tired and like didn't really have much to contribute anyway because didn't go for like the safety training stuff 'cause was late but it 'cause watched three different like discussions and workshops to teach me how to do stuff there so feel like i've benefitted from that um i'm doing some research and stuff did some homework um just hit the gym well got some food from there and then hit the gym i'm back in my room now um showered off finished all my homework watched you will watch

tired but got through everything today um started studying for my math midterm and started studying for my [inaudible] midterm my chem one is tomorrow feel prepared for it but have like seven hours this will be my last class tomorrow [inaudible] that it starts so should be able to get ready for that before that happens too in good mood [inaudible] but everything will be okay like just wanna keep

sounds really weird and trivial but like it hurts to put headphones in and like [inaudible] like it just it just feel weird don't know how to describe it it just hurts [laughter] but it said don't pop it but we'll see what happens i'm gonna give it like week if it here like next monday uh [inaudible] 'cause like it it irritating me now just have the headphones in today was going relatively well was

the early afternoon then took nap 'cause had like test later on tonight well that just came back from it went relatively well like was really stuck on this one problem but like thank god [laughter] like figured he showed me what should've been doing [laughter] like he fixed like the little mistake was doing so was able to get through that um i'm think flipped one of like it was one of the easier problem that was only worth like eight points anyway so like even given that that only 'cause got half of think feel pretty confident about it not really even confident but feel like worked it out and did like well on it um so now it time for me to like shift focuses like math and um bio 'cause have that test later on so i'm just gonna um [inaudible] couple business things and then club having like pizza night so like probably gonna go to that for food [laughter] but also like so can have like place to do some work in um i'm gonna go to that knock off some work um i'm still thinking about what i'm doing this summer my friend told me like the program i'm going to for spring break like they're legit like recruiting place so like i'm hoping need don't know it in like three week but i'm kinda get i'm kinda getting apprehensive hope like can follow up with him like be able to figure it out hoping like the scholarship comes through and like it allow me to like they'll pay for me to go to summer school so i'm hoping like if all of that things comes together i'll be able to do something [laughter] and like not have to worry about taking orgo cs and math next semester just gotta focuses get through tonight hopefully everything else will play itself out for me today was good it was just extremely busy um had woke up early naturally and like which was good feeling not having to be

[laughter] but i'm just like i'm so tired slash lazy mostly lazy but yeah don't know uh i'll probably knock it out tomorrow um saw that don't know must have been going about the same pace feel like too good but not too bad so [inaudible] i'm gonna do this summer um was warming up to the idea about doing um research kinda like open source or [inaudible] like just got word that like there possibility of me like finding free housing so have to figure out how to do that yeah today was relatively slow day 'cause looking back i've only been awake for like 10 hours and i've already taken nap and plan on going to sleep within like the next hours or so um woke up [knocked] some stuff out my old teacher um wanted to go to lunch with me so we did that we ate talked um she really helped

would've been better just [flying off] and like leaving but yeah um which was nice of her almost like got back worked out real quick [inaudible] shop and bought whole bunch of stuff um yeah don't know it was it neither here nor there um yeah i'm still kinda thinking of how to [inaudible] same type of stuff um like what to do this summer uh like letting go of things like in the past and don't know trying to keep everything focused guess or trying to figure out how to just make the best out of what have [at the moment] today was it was don't know it was day that was daze um woke up went to church it was great service um to to like actually get out and be uncomfortable and do like the calling of like what god asks us to do here on earth um then after that went to um tried to go to the gym but like even though it said it would be open [inaudible] like it was closed when went over there so um [inaudible] today took shower went to [inaudible] office hours [inaudible] three hours bio like an hours ate dinner for the first time [inaudible] oh the church had pizza so [inaudible] um yeah right now i'm chilling watching tv uh compare my math piece though before turn it in or turn in tomorrow but yeah just been sitting here reflecting and thinking and just don't know [inaudible] my teacher told us [inaudible] and about like my life and my future don't know just thinking we'll see what happens though hey um yeah this is completely awful like did the actual survey like an hour ago but forgot to do the the audio part but today was it was weird day it was my first day back to class in chemistry didn't learn single thing don't know if was sleeping on an lesson but like picked up on it so like was able to like get through like the set [inaudible] later on so that happened then went to the med school campus to go to [inaudible] to like for little [inaudible] start-up that i'm part of so did that then ca had like two phone meetings and then once got done with that like immediately went to sleep for like an hour and half woke up [inaudible] and found like it lowered my productivity throughout the day but feel like deserved it but that happened got through uh hit the gym saw an friends for bit then showered and went to [inaudible] not [inaudible] [actually said it] and like i've been got done with that around like 1015 1020-ish but it was just don't know just been like feeling stuff out and getting [inaudible] like actual like living stuff done 'cause just had whole bunch of emails and like whole bunch of stuff to go through think i'm closer to figuring out what i'm gonna do this summer um but yeah hopefully [inaudible] on youtube um thing that kind of i've done today um besides that i'm not exactly into this space but i'm thinking and talking about it so guess that good and then like possibly after that i'm gonna be able to like don't know i'm gonna go see the layout and yeah today was uh it was an okay day guess um had phone call for the little the thing do at the [med] school it was like an interview knocked that out uh started the paper but didn't finish it i'm about to haven't done much work um so went to class had meeting with like an exec on facebook for about 30 minutes didn't really talk but sent him an email so hopefully something comes from that um had class [lab] pretty much understand most of the content though [inaudible] so that was positive um so [inaudible] [my dorm] hit the gym got out around like 830 it was like started like being sluggish and like wasting time because like got back and out the shower [inaudible] 800 [inaudible] 930 it 1100 now but i'm getting stuff done just really slowly so hopefully can still go to bed like at decent hour or at least like yeah i'll figure something out yeah but i'm in relatively good mood probably because of productivity oh and got an email from another summer program but it wasn't like yes or no it was like uh do you want to work with us and feel like the answer to that should always be yes yeah um we'll see what happens there today was okay guess um woke up had phone interview for director internship for [inaudible] which did not realize had applied to apparently [inaudible] for me to get it and it want decision by friday honestly don't think i'm going to take it but i'm going to ask couple of upperclassmen what it think about it class oh was like surprisingly up and like active early throughout the day but was tired but got through it got to the little [inaudible] sleep study at [redacted] that was supposed to do um was lucky enough to get there before snow get in and get out before the snow fell got lot of homework done while was there so don't have that much to do [inaudible] and like yeah and then like uh took nap so i'm in relatively good mood don't have lot lot to do but feel like it just to like start knocking stuff out um all right now i'm just waiting on some food because like my friend ordered some and i'm trying to [inaudible] because didn't missed dinner because of the study but besides that in pretty good mood like [inaudible] but not that much um and heard back from the thing [inaudible] so might do that and combine it with another internship and like use both stipends so yeah there there promise so i'm gonna start off from last night ended up staying up lot longer because like one my chem homework took me took me longer than thought it would and yeah tv um woke up got lot of stuff done able to push through the day um but like everything like fell apart like after [500] got email back saying no about the program well combining the program 'cause just really wanted both stipends um about it took me way too long to close the store at work 'cause like there was customers in there who was just being rude and then like the machine wasn't working so have to call my manager about stuff like that the dining hall was closed and now i'm here i'm just don't know going to pick the scraps back up and see what can do yeah today was like the climax of lot of stressful stuff um i'm gonna piggyback up from where was last night last night was like okay this isn't gonna take me that long i'm just gonna go to bed early yeah it took me lot longer think 'cause [had] my first psat so [inaudible] and then just like study just everything took longer than thought it would just like attending to business and stuff and then today was the day of like actually getting the business done [inaudible] well first went to the gym early in the morning had well went to bed like 300 woke up at like 800 to go to the gym called my dad he was like you have to do [inaudible] told him yeah then got that cleared um [just] like dealing with thinking about that all day and now like all the other things that like had to like trouble including my school psat and just like had work like school work and like physical work um but got through everything went to [inaudible] which was nice but like got tired in the middle of like the sermon kind of things at the end and feel like missed like some of it but got like the general idea but i'll try and do better next time and then besides that um yeah i'm been doing good like productivity wise but just like the volume is very high don't think [inaudible] but i'm managing so should be able to knock out the rest of it in few and then call it day should be good so today was uh guess got started with last night um had like relatively more than thought did so like had to get all that done um so like don't know ended up taking way longer than thought it would uh just watched movie to chill at the end of the day uh woke up today around noon hit the gym hit new max so that was nice and then did study session for my [inaudible] midterm uh haven't studied that much honestly but there not really that much to study just [all the] notes [inaudible] understand how to do everything but like make sure practice and stuff went to work uh just left and about to knock some more work out and then don't know either go to party or just chill so it relatively good day yeah so today was weird day [laughter] um woke up like extremely tired probably 'cause went to bed at 300 in the morning but yeah uh tried to listen to the 900 am service for church but was too tired so just went to like went back to sleep woke up for the 11 o'clock one um and it was cool it was actually like really good service and don't know he changed the topic from like being about like passo like palm sunday and like the easter story to something that was like about relevant like current events and just like life it really touched me and actually cried and haven't cried in minute but appreciate like the emotional release then left my bible there didn't figure that out until got back to my dorm so that was like another 30-minute walk that was unnecessary had meeting with the [pre-med path] who also doing bme it was just like extremely helpful like uh she just like don't go [laughter] uh after that went to the chem help room [about to] go to the bio one and then math later 'cause have three sets due tomorrow in good mood just gotta get through keep pushing got midterm this week then have four more week of class six more week [and then i'm up] in [redacted] so just trying to get there um today was weird had um the admissions officer from chicago like that knew like because applied to chicago she was in town she asked me like take her out for breakfast think she she thought like had free like meals don't um so that [inaudible] so it was cool and have like relatively lot left over um so yeah that happened and then went to um went to the gym had quick workout then went um to class made it on time then was dumb tired in my head [inaudible] one of the crucial eight steps [inaudible] was able to figure out later on in the homework yeah that happened and like went back to my dorm took nap um and then it like had another phone interview but [inaudible] don't know if want the job because can't do it anyway i'm probably not gonna get it because they're only picking two people um then went to ocs some talks or whatever then started doing my homework it wasn't hard but it seems like lot longer than thought because like supposed to be done with like the majority of my stuff like around now so just like come home [inaudible] meeting [inaudible] like study for ps midterm on wednesday that didn't really happen still gonna get it done because of my extra energy from the nap but um probably gonna end up grinding on like the little like housekeeping stuff have to do [inaudible] like do little bit of studying for my midterm next week and then like right now [inaudible] doing ps so i'll just probably be late because like honestly don't want to be there that long anyway because the conversations aren't gonna be hella productive so yeah today um don't know so i'm gonna pick up from like last night guess so ended up doing like was li very unproductive but also got like lot done too so it was like weird balance between the two was able to like get fair amount of stuff done just not like as much as i'd hoped got like stuff knocked out like from today and tomorrow so like it shouldn't be as bad um aside of that um yeah went to bed around 200 woke up at like 1000 uh hit class [inaudible] paying attention now so won't be struggling at the end of the semester had lecture for [ls] [inaudible] which was nice um and went to ma uh was supposed to go to math but like just went to sleep instead woke up like an hour in uh no he didn't care and then like after that um went to lab just got out went to like little [inaudible] thing don't know if i'm gonna do it but it sounds interesting it just like it gonna rock my gpa next semester 'cause like this stress that 'cause like i'm i'm breaking down right now so especially if next semester have to do it again don't know don't think it would be that bad if did like broader subject like the gpa would've mattered it would just be [inaudible] gotta see i'm trying to take [inaudible] math and cs at the same time and they're like [inaudible] could [feel] like [inaudible] class like extremely easy and like know there not lab component for [cs50] but still lot regardless and just something to think about so um today was okay guess woke up in time for class didn't make breakfast but ate after like had class like 10 to 100 was hungry but it was okay um so yeah ate came back did like lot reviewing for chem because like i've been slacking recently hoping like understand everything was able to like do the review sheet like by myself uh without looking at well with the notes that like wouldn't be using for the test so it wasn't that bad uh that mainly what i've been doing took nap so hopefully i'll be like in better mood uh i'm not exactly that nervous just like know need to do well in this um feel like prepared did like little bit of like other stuff like business-wise so like won't have that much to do after the exam i'm probably just gonna lift um probably like two hours of homework don't know like some tv probably call it day yeah the week almost over thank god um but yeah i'm here uh still don't know happy got the thing for the summer hoping that like can maximize and do other stuff with it and then besides that just um try to make sure my grades are [inaudible] really yeah in relatively good mood i'm in good mood just [inaudible] different yeah um today was kind of don't know i'm gonna go based off of yesterday think ended after sent my midterm um yeah it was okay it was just like it was hard but everybody said it was hard so that reassuring um now when got uh home read did lot of watching tv uh [laughter] 'cause empire came back on ended up going to bed at like around 300 woke up at like 1100 for my 12 o'clock section um 'cause my 11 o'clock class got canceled my [inaudible] class let out early it was pretty good day guess and had capital one interview for like the summit they're having it was messed up lot of easy stuff [laughter] besides that it felt pretty good about it guess there just like just like the interview itself went well but then like the fi last five minutes was like there was just some of the equations thing that like should have it should have been easy to do don't know why kept don't know kept messing it up like yeah she was patient with me um then had meeting with iop that lot of relatively lot of work yesterday knocked out tonight um we will see what actually gets done and yeah um yeah we'll see what happens it lot to do lately we'll see don't plan on like doing that much else tonight though 'cause it my rest day at the gym my friend had concert but tell him to go 'cause mean we're not even close like that and then there um it was hackathon it was like probably wouldn't go to that either honestly yeah i'm probably just gonna stay in and do homework so today was don't know it was weird day um went to bed around like 200 or 300 but was like i've already taken like two-hour nap so well really like uh three hours [laughter] throughout the day um but yeah that happened woke up around 800 hit the gym went to class to office hours hit hack-a-thon didn't really do much but experience is experience [laughter] um then put package in the mail was like yay finally get paid 'cause just sold something on ebay um so that money should clear like next week i'm getting paid [instant] so that nice uh then went to work uh after that went to get dinner but then like got and then went to church [just thought i'd share it with] some friends but it was it it be it started off as like good discussion didn't really end that way but don't know it was just talking about like life as person in body of color in world [laughter] that don't really like person in body of color don't know think it emotional it was like got me thinking yeah um yeah still got like everything else on my mind still got midterm to prepare for [i had to] go to church for minute and there cipher at [redacted] uh i'm not really gonna participate but might as well watch 'cause my homie gonna be in it [inaudible] and feel like earned at least partially some enjoyable friday 'cause [inaudible] so um feel like the last time did survey was like when was walking back from dinner with my friends to church so hit church um then went to the [inaudible] it didn't really get good until like an hour or two hour in or like an hour and half in like their [inaudible] [inaudible] cool and then one of my friends it like convinced me to go to party at the quad which was decent um yeah mean good by my standards but yeah and then came back knocked out an homework watched tv for little bit went to bed around 400 woke up for work at like 1100 uh left work went to the undergrad recruitment place and did couple of phone calls but it said like it had lot of help earlier in the day so it didn't really need me to do much um and then like looked at my ls lab report but like i've done the majority of like what can do now until like the results come back on tuesday so i'm gonna just worry about that later um just came back from the gym eating dinner so [inaudible] um so yeah probably gonna turn my phone off around 600 and just study like really really hard for my midterms and [inaudible] for upper [inaudible] gonna start with upper yeah my neither of my roommates are here so enjoying yeah having an apartment with nobody else in it and yeah still have an worry [inaudible] like like grades like my life and like uh the bags came to college with and yeah oh and found out that like little girl was mentoring back home got into stanford so guess that was like heartwarming in way for uh me yeah she was legacy but don't know i'm proud of their for what it worth don't know like slightly don't know it just got me thinking but [inaudible] better than one billionaire two yeah all that jazz probably just i'm about to take shower and study um so guess gotta pick up from yesterday um started studying well really at first it something like after finished meeting took nap when got back uh was able to grind um took nap woke up was able to grind for about like four or five hours it was productive um there lot of stuff on like the second mark for my bio class it was just like why would i've known this it was just it was unnecessary but um figured it out for the most part um i'm going to south by southwest tomorrow so um we're going to office hours on the next day so now we're at sunday went to church it was good service it was like some of that still got somehow was able to keep with me so appreciate that um then hit the gym for like 30-minute run 'cause need more cardio in my life and then felt like was in shape anyway ate so hit the books it was office hours for like three or four hours um right now i'm ch ate again i'm chilling need to go back and finish studying and take care of my housekeeping and stuff um basically i'm becoming more and more okay with like myself my life my own space my own future just couple of things that are like bugging me that have to figure out um i'm here though mostly in good mood um today was yet another day um monday knocked off my bio midterm lot of the stuff studied was on there which was nice lot of stuff that like thought had studied and prepared for like that was on there that i've even forgotten or like applied wrong but it wasn't that that [inaudible] big thing though so don't know feel decent about it it wasn't like terrible it was just like uh yeah so had class and lab which was like extremely stressful i'm stressed out and then had the exam it wasn't bad [i got] lot of thing right but feel like there was some thing that like got wrong that like didn't need to that like really could [affect] my grade like no matter how generous it choose to be um 'cause like something that like studied or like just glazed over but um we'll see what happens i'll probably stress about my grade later today but like how my chem exam was this morning which is cool it should have prepared me to like do better today but yeah it didn't really happens just read something [inaudible] something [inaudible] so but yeah we'll see ok so today it was uh don't know hope you guys [inaudible] whatever um woke up had review session with my math teacher it was cool she was really helpful she wanna make sure can do this by myself when hit the midterm there is and then went to class um it was like [inaudible] missed stuff before because like i'd actually been studying for the quiz we have this week i'm hoping i'd do well on that too um yeah and then outside of that have to make sure that like actually prepare for um the midterm that have on thursday and the quiz on sunday i'm thinking about going [inaudible] 'cause they're like actually showing [inaudible] class took nap had workshop for math um and that was followed by um lab but like we didn't actually have lab today we're just like doing some like doing something like [inaudible] so it got knocked out really quickly um so now i'm about to go for run quick lift mostly cardio [inaudible] goldman by dinner tonight and like hadn't heard back [inaudible] he the guys who go here he like the diversity recruiter or whatever ambassador or whatever asked him and he was rude about it but yeah had another friend who like older than me but like he also he he he yeah i'm not going into that i'm just gonna study hopefully like i'm able to get into bed probably like early than was supposed to so so today was fabulous day in every way except [laughter] my academic life um yeah so woke up uh early had meal with my maths tf because like there is review session later on in the afternoon but like couldn't go to that 'cause had work so like instead just scheduled like two hours of the office hours with her like outside of that time and then slid at in at the end the last 30 minutes but anyway yeah had office hours with her and then like chem lecture um maths it was like two-step but it figured out most of it but it which is hopeful but gotta make sure actually like [inaudible] like capitalize on it on the day of the test um yeah that happening and then um had section for chem but it was like it was something learned in high school that like for some reason never forgot but yeah was able to like to be fine in class and then uh ate went to work knocked out all my chem homework um so like all have left to do well then left work um went to the review session like the last 30 minutes of it um hit the gym with friends so had to split up the work out but finished it um had shower um go to [op] reviewing from my [inaudible] and then gotta knock out um some other stuff 'cause got midterm tomorrow um but yeah it actually like it was pretty good day um last night decided to like tackle my demons demons hasn't replied [laughter] but yeah mean it start [laughter] and then um found well there is like change in the directive for the scholarship i'm on and like part of the scholarship is like money to like excuse me money to like fund internships and like stuff over the summer in case you don't have enough funding which like technically like the [io] fee like is supposed to give me like some stuff to like for [housing] but technically didn't which give me enough wriggle room to secure the bag and get both stipends and then just like hold off on her and then like so that that kind of made me happy and got um won some free celtics ticket on sunday but it like uh don't know uh got to figure out what i'm doing with my life you know like how to fit all the stuff like typically do on sunday like into like life and yeah um 'cause i've already finished my chem pset and like last time come back it said it was gonna be that from 1200 have to figure that out but yeah um pretty good mood have maths midterm tomorrow that like i've been preparing for but it like don't [laughter] it just like there just so much going on it like don don't know it not hard it just lot um so yeah that that there neither here nor there um and got um yeah but it just that but relatively good day all right so um today was it was actually all right pretty good actually oh stayed up little longer studying than i'd liked to but yeah you know got it in got it done um woke up had class proper and then listening quiz but actually got both of them right or at least both of them mostly right so feel like it [inaudible] thank god probably gonna pull my grade up hopefully um lecture for ls didn't pay attention to that much um [inaudible] an early uh workshop for math or studying friend called me uh we talked for about like an hour should have spent that time asleep but i'm not tired anymore so guess that [inaudible] yourself out studying for midterm right now it in like an hour so about an hour to study mean i've been studying like throughout the day and like yesterday and like for the past two weeks so yeah just like little things throughout the get everything it just should be able to do it once i've studied which is different but at least my nerves is pretty good right now so yeah all right so i'm doing this right now because like feel like messed up earlier um yeah 'cause took nap instead of like doing anything but yeah today guess have to start with last night took the math midterm wasn't nearly as hard any of the practices but it like all the stuff studied like wasn't on there so like it had like it goods and bads um and then what happened after that oh yeah and then [i just went to the dorm] knocked out like little bit of work didn't do much did like stuff said was gonna get done like that day but yeah didn't really get ahead or whatever then today happened um oh yeah my friend like called me so like was up and then another friend called me asked me like 'cause she she needed help so was [inaudible] for like an hour so didn't go to bed till like 500 had class at 1000 so that was that was interesting didn't fall asleep or anything it was just like and then you know i'm coming out with cold so [all that feel stressed] um yeah so then that happened went to class had meeting had meeting with like an upperclassman he was like he ju don't know it was it was worthwhile so feel like got something out of it that cool though actually get to talk to him um and like learned from him that goods came back to my dorm um well got an burritos from like the [inaudible] club got to my dorm went to sleep for goods like three hour slept through [inaudible] supposed to go to conference in boston but it was like snowing-ish and it also like have cold so didn't feel like going to either of that um yeah my friend had concert so just came back from that but i'm in goods mood like outside of like me being sick right now know why i'm sick it 'cause [inaudible] but um besides being sick um school going okay um other things they're changing which is like don't know if that goods or bads but yeah yeah that that about it so today was um it was another day i'm gonna start with yesterday guess so yeah finished um going to my friend [inaudible] went back to my dorm watched tv for minute uh yeah it was don't know the episode was pretty good it was basically like it like it completely swi it was great episode it was like horror movie it was cool uh and yeah we support donald glover uh so yeah then did course for like training for um the internship i'm doing so like that took me about hour went to sleep and woke up uh went to work uh work at like 945 so went to work when left that went to the gym started doing laundry that kind of where i'm at right now um started knocking out like things in my email applications and stuff or just things that are sitting there that to do later um so yeah just need to finish that lab report but already started it and then um need to finish like some sets but it not lot it like yeah already started them so there shouldn't be that much left to do probably gonna watch movie or two gonna fold up my laundry yeah so uh forgetting where did the survey last but um yeah stayed in knocked out thesis knocked out lab report eventually thought i'd watch movie but it was like already 100 in the morning when started so didn't do it um trying to get

was waking up like every hour like to cough up like mucus and stuff it was it was nasty but i'm good now so that what matters um yeah then after that watched celtics game came back just hit the gym um actually low-key like ahead of schedule hey [redacted] um so after that probably just gonna [shed] some pieces maybe call it night uh doing good also so it good thank you um i'm getting over the cold low-key so that always nice just just [maintaining] guess um today was pretty good day actually uh knocked out the sets last night later [inaudible] earlier [inaudible] um so yeah got back to my dorm around like 1130-ish uh [inaudible] uh woke up yeah it took me forever to get up and like felt like immersed in sickness but wasn't terrible um yeah was like um i'm sick but the dude like somebody else [inaudible] math so like the dude [inaudible] got me sick [inaudible] don't have to sit by him anymore so that blessing um and don't have to be like rude about it like tell him to like cover his mouth up um yeah so then class ended hit the gym and then went to lab the lab only lasted like an hour and like 20-ish minutes so like that was blessing was able to eat and then picked up um an food picked up shift at work so i'm here right now um yeah because like [inaudible] for like two hour had to figure out how i'm gonna like make my other appointments [inaudible] just like club meetings and stuff but we'll see about that uh probably knock out an homework today was okay um it started off with me going uh to class late barely getting there on time so got there um and then hit um had lecture for ls and yeah had class took like lay down for while tried to watch movie [inaudible] um had lab um able to knock it out i'm glad it was one of the last ls lab just have presentation next week that need to prepare for but that another story uh so yeah all that happened and then i'm ju don't know just feel really tired it like i'm at the edge of like my cold but still can feel it like it sucks but it just almost done that really like been the big thing oh got my grade back for my ls midterm got it need like but can probably still end up around plus minus but have to really really work hard for that but can see what can do and yeah so today was another day started the day feeling relatively the same but that whatever um had uh uh finished yesterday the survey yesterday like after woke up from nap so yeah after the nap finished movie workout uh then went to bed at like 400 so [inaudible] no didn't end up getting out of bed till like 1000 had class at 10 and went straight [inaudible] probably the first [inaudible] so went straight uh and then hit the gym tried [inaudible] the first time that was don't know it was different but like the way it felt um and then went to [inaudible] then hit the ocs [inaudible] get advise on studying abroad and all that uh it said optimally can probably do like semester abroad [inaudible] next semester is probably gonna suck in that regard but hey what can you do uh so that happened and then yeah that cool and then there meeting for [inaudible] don't know sometimes feel empty there so many demons in my life and yeah don't know they've been sitting there for while was like and then it like it just happens just like well don't really know what to do at this point [inaudible] i've tried everything school okay-ish probably thought like realized what standard deviation means like in regard to curve so uh yeah kinda changed my perspective uh hopefully uh it won't be that trash [inaudible] finish tomorrow um today was yet another one of those days it feels like one of those days but it was actually pretty good [laughter] um guess had to pick up yesterday from don't know just didn't get lot of work done don't really remember what happened after those [laughter] low-key had an emotional breakdown but got through it so but yeah those those happened uh woke up went to class one of my sections was canceled so those nice uh knocked out my piece those was easy uh then went to had coup hit the gym had couple meetings to go through uh worked on my project with my group worked on my other project with my group um integrated an piece why it took so long [inaudible] late was able to knock all those out uh it was actually better days like socially or whatever uh stuff still on my mind but i'm still here and yeah just trying to figure things out tomorrow should be fun though 'cause [yani] or whatever coming [yani] [inaudible] my friends are performing and yeah still have to do pre-lab and two questions but besides those should be good so picking up from think like yesterday relatively late after finished my set and stuff with my friends woke up managed to wake up and get to the gym class some pretty boring work it was [packed] but like after that um ate watched some episode of atlanta and chilled uh went to yard fest it was pretty fun actually most fun i've had in minute [laughter] um so yeah uh appreciate that i'm pretty tired but got to knock some other stuff out tonight but i'll live but um guess it was just dope like again to be like around [inaudible] people and stuff and yeah so that life um no breakdown so far so you know that always good thing and we're here just really ready for the weekend and [inaudible] so and low-key lost my voice too but so today woke up right around like 1000-ish got to work early started set but was like doing had work but like it was kinda busy so yeah um that happened dad called texted my uncle texted like family back home and stuff and then went to um went to get haircut so need to like don't know yeah uh [i got a] haircut it was nice then went back there was meeting today about like an event that happened yesterday something like went horribly wrong [yeah] it was just like in the community and like it wanted to speak about it so not much [going on] ate i'm gonna knock out an work go to my friend concert and then yeah so today was it was actually pretty good so [since] did the last survey last night like went to one of my friends' concerts went to that good two be able to encourage him and stuff um then after knocked out work did essay knocked out something else that had to do uh yeah [i got] really tired [when] was on the phone with friend so didn't end up doing much after that much after that and [to be honest] [inaudible] [so you know stayed up] [laughter] for that but still somehow found the energy to wake up for church for like the 900 am service um loved [redacted] performance that was uplifting but was like the [conversation] with my friend and [it] just like yeah don't know it was encouraging and then [even though it was like] 200 in the morning it was really long but yeah um and then had church was like the service was great and it was like it was much needed so that happened and then um went to the gym was able to knock out like some business stuff like applying to stuff and like uh just handling business or whatever after that was able to um yeah after that just oh yeah went went volunteering today so like that was the first time i've done that in college so you know it was nice don't know like it was making [rice] it was don't know it was low-key stressful but it was like it was only some hour so [or something like that] turning in my ls set right now um tried to start studying [laughter] when got back got some studying for ls done not as much as i'd hoped but then again that what have tomorrow for um so like yeah just need to study some more um and have two more set to check with people besides that today was pretty good day and also productive and now that few and far between so still got week left so today um yeah as said like knocked out those pieces last night um and then like was started studying took mock quiz for ls looked at some notes finished my [western] plan for like project then woke up um moderately on time cla my class [inaudible] was trash didn't learn anything at all math was okay uh hit the gym afterwards and then went to lab it was actually kind of fun lab and it wasn't like hard lab report it was my last lab of the semester for either of my class so i'm glad about those had to lay down and take nap 'cause had like really bad headache there like set in like right before lab um so yeah had to lay down for minute got some food had couple meetings where like i'm bringing work with me 'cause don't feel like having all this piled up at the end so yeah those kind of where my head is at um but yeah i'm just thinking about life and all those today was really busy but it was an okay day for the most part um had presentation in my lab and [two] [inaudible] um yeah hit the gym with friend ate in between still not really hungry but okay yeah how're you doing um and like besides that it was an okay day don't know feel like had good day lot of work to do kind of worried but yeah i'm i'm chilling [inaudible] so i'm just trying to get to the end of the week to the end of next week just trying to get out of here honestly but came to grips with couple of things yesterday oh yeah by the way [inaudible] because like last night was like the [bmf] elections which took like six hours but feel like it was kind of worth it being there because of like it was don't know it was culturally important or whatever uh guess got [pickup] yesterday i'm not so sure the last time did think it was after the lab hit the gym with the friend maybe after that um got set it took [probably] longer than thought it was gonna like afterwards like left the [mqc] and went to like go chat with some friend and um [inaudible] was like really did great [inaudible] and it like when did go [inaudible] with friend friend um don't know he he was okay he just like he just started whole bunch of problems like with other people and uh feel bad for like the way handled it uh don't know feel like should just be [inaudible] like feel better if just like handled it better 'cause involved with somebody else who didn't need to be involved yeah 'cause was uh [inaudible] class um it was okay math is getting harder chem it don't [inaudible] lecture but nobody [inaudible] going on chem section um my teacher like taught mus taught us something but was distracted because of other things so didn't really like why is you what um sent him some email just some hour ago so hopefully he sends us like something so can do um and then nothing on math set while was on work on the way to see opera for my class um and got some more homework hopefully i'll start studying for got some exam next week and hopefully my tf like email us so can learn whatever like all this beginning and then can also like um work out the stuff with the people from yesterday but i'll figure it out like talk to everyone individually know it [inaudible] just like feel bad 'cause of the way handled it yeah so i'm doing this one bit later because like one thing to say [into] another but um today guess back in [redacted] yesterday uh honestly didn't do that much besides like business stuff and just like getting my life together um hit reset [already] yesterday and then went to um today was supposed to go wake up early go to the gym and was like could've but then when woke up was just like let me just get this extra two hours of sleep so like got about like four-hour nap [got up] finished the assignment but then like that night got another eight hours of sleep so feel great [laughter] um had class not [today] that was my last thursday and i'm really fortunate for that um uh i'm probably gonna do like bunch more administrative stuff because like don't have to do my camp psat but arranged meeting with my um chem tf so have time with him tomorrow so like we can study and study the psat and all that 'cause honestly don't know yeah low-key lost but probably just gonna do more administrative stuff check on this psat um after walked from class had phone call meeting went to the gym with friend ate dinner went to woman that [inaudible] right the little [redacted] event that happened um last weekend and don't know bought some stickers for my [inaudible] for um little fashion show 'cause wanted to be able to enjoy that but um yeah just dealing with stuff [legging] out for said friend dealing with grades and stuff and school and extracurriculars are

yesterday was really upset about the game though because like the cows deserved to win but that story for another day um yeah head to boston tomorrow dunno there like wave of like not sa don't know if sadness is the right word just wave of something that like came over me today dunno i'll get through it yeah to be honest today was kinda rough uh flight was at 1000 got to the airport like 815-ish wasn't too late but yeah still could've got there earlier um bag was overweight even though checked it like prior to that whatever though had to carry some stuff with me security [inaudible] one of my bag so like that helped like at least wasn't like struggling with all that on the plane itself got to harvard the instructions about like where exactly i'd be staying was very very like vague so got to campus at like 200-ish got settled in at 300 um flight was flight went well by the way um other than like the whole luggage thing got unpack oh was carrying that bag like through boston like up and down harvard campus but settled in um got my um settled in got my key all my stuff here um th was thinking about like was looking well first got facial 'cause yeah needed that but then um was looking for like fan and like stuff that like too big for me to pack but don't know there not really anybody here like the school was basically closed and then i'm also looking for food but think i've just realized that i'm gonna have to pay myself for food or figure out how to cook don't know how to cook so i'll probably just gonna be buying food every day from the square the square is really expensive though so we're gonna see how that happens and yeah don't know we'll see what happens today was decent day guess um well [figure i'll start with] yesterday actually went and did like the handling business and like [quick] thinking [that what had to do] so that nice um ate went to bed right when was about to go to bed old associate called don't know [dealt with them] [um] yeah don't know we're on speaking terms now [i guess that was] pretty critical with my mental health or whatever that was nice um so yeah that happened and then oh so went to church [i was] actually like moderately like awake at the time was supposed to be but yeah that happened but the only thing is like by the time [like church happened but] they had program after so by the time we got out didn't get back to my apartment till like 400 um so yeah there that um so i'm just now like approaching [redacted] to get my stuff from my uncle house [to] bring that back take they home yeah uh mean they better that do like dry run now so like know what to expect like that way said [i] could work but have to like take all this to his house yeah so today was it was pretty okay day um it was my first day of work woke up but went to the wrong place like there are two place with the same address one in [redacted] one in [redacted] but like left the house early [inaudible] my apartment early enough that like was able to get there was only like 10 minutes late but it still uh could have been better than me like running to and from different train stations in like tie and dress pants and dress shoes um work happened it seems to really uh like really cool opportunity and there like lots of cool projects that can work on and like things can leverage different like [inaudible] like it kind of connects all my interests like i'm glad that happened um so yeah there that and then on top of that um oh and then we had meeting at like 200 in the afternoon at that point was tired tried my hardest to stay up during the meeting and don't think uh looked like was like knocked out asleep hope nobody noticed um emailed like my direct manager who like between my actual manager and me so like she really cool and she didn't like say anything to me she probably wouldn't have but like now sent her an email on the side like with the my first projects that did today um like explai well not even explaining but just like letting her know and apologizing so we'll we'll see what she say tomorrow um so yeah that happened then went to pop-up shop for top dog entertainment um because my friends wanted me to go

store tomorrow 
7XP88,um today spent most of the day with my friends because um got really lucky and ended up having new like i've was really lucky and found friends group here in college much faster than thought would and so i've been spending lot of time with them um but i've been also dealing with um my boyfriend who goes to different college and he trying to adjust to life there and he misses me lot and it pretty difficult for me because um i've known for the past probably last mo past month that i've wanted to break up with them and wanted to wait until got until came to to to college because didn't wanna end it while was you know still on vacation and it was his birthday this past week and so didn't wanna you know break up with them before before school started and or before his birthday around that time of festivities or whatever um and so i'm dealing with that and it it very difficult because he very clingy and he doesn't understand that he bothering me lot and that you know need my own space and that have new friends and it also that wanna realize tha thought was gonna be with them for long long time but realize that in college i'm meeting new people i'm with you know new environment and i'd really like to meet new guys new people um and so it difficult for me just to talk to them it it it even hard for me to talk to them doesn't wanna talk to them in the evenings used to share lot more details with them then before then do now um so i'm just trying to deal with that and i'm trying to find the best time to break up with them because really need to end it wanna move on with my life i've met somebody else who think is really really cute and so wanna like connect with them bit more um but i've been having pretty i've had pretty good day 'cause went to my my spanish class and it was really engaging and it wasn't as intimidating as thought it was gonna be and met new friends there too so we're gonna grab lunch next week um and just got like got lot of things done um tried to paint my nails today but it wasn't really successful um so i'm gonna have to try again and do that and it like college is just about figuring things out and meeting new new meeting new people and trying new experiences and today went to the activities fair which was really cool because joined was i'm into joining like lot of dance clubs um but also signed up for boxing which was totally totally unexpected so might drop running and end up going to boxing instead because running something can do on my own um and i'm really interested to do volunteering um and really like my class lot of my friends is in my class so think that it gonna be really fun to have them there but also meet new people um so i'm just trying to like navigate it all and trying to figure out um how to do things on habitual daily basis like doing my laundry um today was like little frustrated 'cause my nails didn't turn out as well as would've liked it the first time i've ever done them by myself and so it was just tough to do by myself um but was really happy yesterday because my friends came over and i've just been in really good place in terms of making friends and doing stuff and it lot better than thought it would be because make doesn't make friends that easily or not in the same environment as people do so need to connect one-on-one but it just kind of happened and i'm really glad that it did today went to dance auditions and it was kinda weird because was going into it thinking that i'd do pretty well but it was actually kind of awkward because went in and it turns out that i'm not as good at dancing as thought was or it takes me more time to learn choreography than it do for other people so was feeling really down while was around like like through most of the first half because just was it wasn't that was uncomfortable but felt really out of my depth and thought oh my god i'm not as good as thought was um but just you know kept going through it 'cause it was five hours of auditions um and then the second choreograph-choreography that learned was much better um and then by the time got to the third one felt like felt more confident 'cause was just freestyling it even if it wasn't the exact thing that it wanted um so hopefully get um placed into one or more company pieces maybe not in the exclusive group but um in the company pieces um so that was most of my day 'cause got got back last night to my dorm at 230 and then got locked out of my room [inaudible] so didn't go to bed until 300 but woke up around 930 and just skipped breakfast and went to lunch and had like really big had big lunchbrunch whatsit um and the thing is like i'm having hard time gauging how much food i'm eating because at home like it was always really clear for me how much should be eating um but now it not that clear to me and it like stresses me out because wanna make sure that i'm not overeating and that been problem for me 'cause there like so much abundance of food around and there so many thing to choose from that sometimes have harder time like choosing which one wanna do um but i'm you know i'm working it out and and as the you know the all these events with food come join my ac my club stuff dies down it gonna be bit better um last night got walked home by the guy that i'm into and that was really really fun he fell asleep on my shoulder while we was watching movie um and then we made plans for brunch these morning so we had brunch and now we're at one of the libraries hanging out gonna watch netflix um so i'm like happy about that um finished my linguistics reading these morning which was really nice so just have to takes notes on that and have to do my reading for one of my other classes so it two chapters of the textbook which should be fine wanna get that done tomorrow before go out to [redacted] um i'm like i'm i'm in good place right now just really wanna break up with my boyfriend because it weight over my shoulder and wanna have other meaningful relationships like with these guy that i'm into so um that just been really frustrating for me because i'm very much over it and i've been over it for weeks but he still floating around and he still he not bothering me but he doesn't know that i'm not in love with him anymore and just wanna be and it sounds awful but just wanna be over with it because it run it course for me and i'm ready to move on so i'm gonna talk to my parents and see how that go and hopefully end that pretty quickly because i'm want that out of my life and wanna move on and meet new people or whatever um so just have to figure out how i'm gonna do it but think i'm gonna do it in the next day or so because it getting really really tiresome and doesn't wanna be doing thing with guy when i'm dating someone else and not say that have boyfriend i'm not gonna do that um and have no it sounds pretty bad but have no like ethical problem with it just doesn't wanna do it because feel like it unfair even if it something that i'm gonna go ahead and do anyway so just wanna make sure that these doesn't like speed up before break up with my boyfriend so have to do that so we'll see how that go uh today woke up around 830 and was kinda upset because didn't sleep longer um got back at like 200 last night again and was really upset that didn't sleep longer but did and was kind of up an wondering if should go to audit another audition not really an audition but um another dance showcase event like introduction to the dance group that wanted to join wasn't really feeling it but ended up going anyway because um didn't make it to the one auditioned at yesterday so thought i'd just keep my options open and went to breakfast and did little bit of work and then went and it was pouring rain don't have raincoat yet because my mom hasn't bought me one which is fine um and went there and actually had ton of fun really like doing the american smooth we did like little bit of swing which loved and actually thought ballroom was gonna be not boring but wasn't going to do it changed my mind to do modern instead but i'm just gonna keep options open and do that too maybe can do two dance group we'll see um uh but left little bit early 'cause wanted to eat lunch in the in the dining hall instead of staying and eating pizza with everybody else 'cause wanted to have healthy food and was also just wanted to finish an stuff up so met up with friend and then with with few friend and then went off with one of the friend and went uh end up in one of the libraries and we just talked for an hour and half it was actually pretty deep conversation which was nice um and then mom and dad came and picked me up and went and had dinner with them um and we talked uh alternative school paths and things that i'm gonna do um in the future like changing my major potentially um and we also talked about my boyfriend how that whole things gonna go down and whether or not i'm gonna break up with them and how to do that have you decided when i'm gonna do it and how i'm gonna do it so feel little bit better about that 'cause it more definite um i'm just really happy about that um and had really nice night with them it make uh pita salad which is my favorite salad um and now i'm back and i'm hanging out with an friend which is really really great and it just been good day 'cause really ended up liking the dance group that went to today and i'm hoping that can continue doing it uh have such busy week coming up have all sorts of club event every single night this week and one night don't get back until midnight um so that that good um mean it not good but i'm back at midnight and we'll see how that go hope can maintain weirdly different sleep schedule but at least my courses the earliest one is only at 1000 am twice week the other day it at 1100 so i'm really really lucky schedule-wise um and i'm just excited for the week everything really fun have friend in my courses so um we're gonna see how it go yeah today woke up around 900 early even though went to bed at 345 last night which was kind of annoying um but i've just been having really good day um skipped breakfast today just because woke up late and didn't want to go to annenberg at 900 have to rush to get to annenberg at 900 then have to go back at 100 or something so just ended up working in my room and then left for lunch around noon and then decided that needed to finish some of the work for one of my classes so did that and took some online quiz um and didn't do as well as wanted and it just bringing back all the memories of when was taking the same subject in '08 when was taking chem in sophomore year when was not very good at it and really doubted all my strength and stuff like that and it was just really frustrating because my teacher always made me feel dumb even though don't think i'm dumb and i'm just like the feelings of uncertainty are coming back to me and really really don't like it um but i'm just gonna power through it and hope that it better because now it there lot more support there lot more people willing to help me lot more places can turn to which are really nice and have friends in my section that got tonight um and then went to ballroom dance info meeting and right as was finishing was gonna go to like boxing opening meeting except two of my friends realized just as got to uh got to the the boxing meeting or outside the building that it next monday and so we was just kind of dumb we ended up going back to friends dorm to work and then we went to one of the events in the yard today and had some fun and then went to went to meeting for one of the other clubs want to join which was really nice and now i'm back working with everyone else um friends of mine was talking to the guy that i'm into and he interested it kind of weird like he not ready for relationship apparently but he interested but he if he not if he hanging out with me he having good time but if he not with me it like totally fine and he don't like necessarily feel the need to like reach out but it was kind of vague so it like i'm not go he apparently according to my friends he not like willing or he not he don't need to like seek out or do he want to but when we're talking it like totally fine um so it kind of weird and i'm just didn't know if should like back off or not you know not be as for mean haven't been that forward because i've still got the boyfriend thing and because also do want to take it slow don't mind taking it slow but now feel weird being like continuing to you know flirt with him or whatever so i'm gonna just see how it go and you know be myself and if at one point he tells me oh like take it slow or i'm not ready then like i'll just re-evaluate from there like hopefully it not that want to change his mind but hopefully like as time passes um and we spend more time together because we have some classes together hopefully he'll realize oh this might be fun or whatever uh and if that ends up being the case then we can still go slow like don't mind doing that just hope that he as interested in him in me as are in him so we'll see uh have to break up with my boyfriend i'm gonna do that tomorrow before go to classes which kind of sucks but haven't spoken to him all day and that going kind of good for me because it given me some peace but think he probably just really upset with me and just need to finish and ends it tomorrow because it weighing on me so we'll see how that go today was good day it was little bit stressful but it was overall good day um woke up around 800 and well no woke up around 800 and realized that i'd stained the bed because got my period this morning so that was little bit annoying and had to take care of that but it just another part of being an adult and getting used to things like that and taking care of it myself usually have my parents help me out when things like this happen um but after that just ended up going to breakfast and did and went to the gym afterwards which fi didn't really wanna go but thought you know wha might as well go i'm gonna have nothing else to do and feel bad if don't go so went and then took care of an random things in my dorm and then went to lunch and had class um and then got really really anxious because broke up with my boyfriend today um and it was really hard because he kinda started negotiating with me and not 'cause told him that don't have the time to hang out the truth is couldn't tell him the truth couldn't tell him that don't really love him anymore and that i've just moved on from that part of my life and it not even his fault it nothing that he did really but i've just i'm not into it anymore need to move on and wanna meet other people i've met this other guy already that i'm really really interested in and hope that that ends up working out so tried to ends it and he starts negotiating me oh we can figure out time to meet it don't have to be for that long and said me said you know we this isn't negotiation this is it it over and can't do anymore it too stressful and he started to cry at the ends and fe just felt awful but it like weight have been lifted from my shoulders and i'm just kinda moving on and it not affecting me too much it probably will affect me more in the future but we'll just have to deal with it think it'll be easier because like he not around him and i'm not seeing him that much um after that just kinda wander around picked up an textbooks and an bo uh package from the ma the mail center um and then met up an friends in his dorm and hung out with the guy that i'm into um that also makes me anxious because can tell that he like somewhat interested but he also holding back little bit and don't know if should be more forward or not be forward 'cause he more shy so i'm not sure like how much is too much and don't wanna like have him run away from me or anything so just gonna see how that go and it like in the context of friends group um there this one other girl that everybody that an people is that really like and it really wanna let her into the friends group but get the feeling that she like super fake and not that nice and just kind of don't want her to be in it but like she going to be in like my inner circle and i'm already kinda worried about blocking group which is really dumb but just hope she don't ends up in my blocking group and don't get tight enough with tight enough with me because i'm just not fan of her and it catty girl things maybe but i'm just not feeling it that much um but he like been really nice actually he lent me his like hef uh headphones and like gone out of his way to do an really nice things for me um so that was really nice um hope it go well i'm on my way to dance audition right now and then have dance practice after that so i'm not getting back to my room until 1200 but it should be fine we'll see how it go i'm kinda sad that i'm not seeing the rest of the squad tonight but feel like should makes myself unavailable so that the guy that i'm into you know absence makes the hearts makes the hearts grow fonder kind of things i'm not stressed about school yet but will be at an point we'll see how it go today was really tired because woke up at 800 after having gone to bed around 200 so went to bed late um but it not as bad because it doesn't doesn't have to wake up at 600 or 700 to get to class and can take my time in the morning which is really nice for me um had my it kinda not it wasn't an official day because there no [inaudible] but still had uh like legit linguistics class and went to my spanish class and they're both really really great um and then went to health services because i'm having problem with my foot and so had to get an ray had to wait for them to tell me what going on it kind of tendinitis um so have to like rest my foot which is really frustrating because it means that can't do dance or boxing or running or really anything for the next one to two weeks and that gonna interfere with me joining groups and stuff like that but at least can go lift weights which is nice um but that really stressing me out because really want to be partic-participate on these things with these things on campus and now can't um and ironically was originally gonna do ballroom and auditioned for these other groups that didn't even get into and now can't do ballroom which was the original plan so moral of the story doesn't change the original plan go with your gut um so that was like th that was really stressful because had to be at my one of my class had to be back insi in one of the buildings for section and was wasn't late but was really stressed about it and was almost in tears at an point because wasn't sure how long things was gonna take um so now i'm wearing boot on my foot not really boot it like flat shoe type things and it annoying but it is what it is um and then after section went with an friends and we had dinner and then we went to hear speaker talk and it was really controversial and there was like security and police and ids shown and everything and then after that we just came back and did homework and now we're hanging around um got lot of work done on my pset which is nice got really ahead so i'm feeling bit better about it um and now i'm probably just gonna go watch netflix or relax 'cause i'm burned out and need to like relax for the day um today went to class and had pretty light day 'cause was able to go to class at 1100 and then had another class at 100 and it was just really nice 'cause was able to do some work in the dining hall and then walk around and take my time so wasn't in rush which is always really nice for me um after my second class went and did some work and then went back to my friend apartment dorm thing where hung out and did some homework and then went to dinner 'cause one of the roommates had date um then hung out in the dining hall for some hour or so and then went back and then left 'cause wanted to hang out with guy that i'm interested in like different guy from the one i've been talking about um like kind of into both but like wanna see how it go and we hung out and then went back to my room around don't know 100 and then stayed and talked with friend for three hour which was really really fun and now he gone and it 430 am and should go to bed today woke around 800 and just went to breakfast after that and reviewed some of the readings for my uh spanish class um saw few friends in the dining hall and then went to my spanish class which was fine um it kinda went fast-paced which was really annoying not annoying but it was tough to follow because there was some people like ha referencing all sorts of things that didn't know was things to reference um and but it was really it was really interesting like got lot out of it and learned lot about the poem we was analyzing um and then went to lunch and hung with some people met in my class it was really nice to find out it was freshmen so know i'm not the only one which is nice to know um and then after that went to uh went out to [redacted] because needed to buy some shirts and some pens and only found the pens didn't find any clothing because nothing fit and it was like expensive uh then came back and my foot ha been really hurting me because of the tendonitis things that have so was like walking around and went and picked up some fliers for club that do and then went to the jobs fair but there wasn't anything good so did lot of walking in vain and then went to meeting for premed students with some friends and had dinner and then we went and it was really dinner was really fun because the guy that i'm into was like more outgoing and think he kind of is coming out of his shell which is really nice and think that it was caused by the fact that hung out with another guy last night think he like got that kind of vibe uh even though he doesn't know for sure um [inaudible] been really nice um so we'll see how that goes and now i'm at friends house and think i'm gonna end up sleeping over here with like bunch of other people so um we're just like having good time and like i'm tired but it so fun and love my class and really like the friends that met and everything that going on so i'm in really good and happy place um and like everything been better since broke up so with my boyfriend that was like weight off my shoulders so that it been really good and i'm having fun time um today didn't get much that much sleep because went to bed around 400 and then um since like me and all my friends slept over um one of my friends was snoring and didn't really get mu that much sleep so woke up at 800 um and then went to lunch brunch at 1200 and then after that went out with some friends to ne to bo to [redacted] um and we went shopping little bit and it was pretty fun um and then we come we got back and we did bit of work at before dinnertime uh and then was walking to dinner and it was it was fun and then at dinner was kinda weird just because the guy that i'm into just like didn't really talk to me has been kind of like actively ignoring me ever since and don't really know what up and don't know what did to cause this it just kind of confusing for me because thought it was going well and apparently he just needs time to process but it just like don't make that much sense to me and don't know if that means that it good for me or not and i'm just like kind of tired of having to deal with this like it it feels like dating and relationships are so much easier for other people and like always get tangled with like guy that don't know what they're doing or like has it has issues or like it don't want to do stuff and it just like it like that want to find somebody but just wish that it wasn't so like perceptually more difficult for me to deal with this like figure it out and do what everybody else do so easily because it just don't know what i'm doing wrong and don't know why it turning out like this and guess just has to roll with it and see what happens um but i'm just like kind of i'm like tired because haven't been getting that much sleep lately but which i'm getting used to but it also just like really frustrating don't understand why um like why are it back and forth like it fun but it also not fun because don't really know what to be expecting so yeah that was the day i'm probably gonna leave soon 'cause don't want to has to deal with this right now just want to probably be alone and process like he processing but whatever today got moderate amount of sleep and even though didn't press the button last night know went to bed around 230 at 230 um and so woke up and got goodnight sleep um even though was um at my friend dorm again and went and ate breakfast with friend and then did my laundry and went to lunch and with friend and did some work spent most of my day doing work and think something didn't go down quite right because felt really nauseous after lunch and so was in the library doing work and just felt really really bad and so came back here and had lasagna and couldn't have any because didn't want any and um things are going pretty well and then like i'm top of my classes and everything are generally fine um um things are going well with this guy but it like weird because he complimented this other girl sweatshirt like 10 minutes ago and it like it just sweatshirt and he never like compliments me even though we was like getting pretty close last night like hanging out and stuff and it just don't really get why he like doing that and he don't compliments me like 'cause he think it gonna be too obvious if he compliments me don't really get it so it kinda frustrating she like weirdly clingy not clingy but she just like weirdly giving signs that she into him and it just bugs me because don't understand what he doing and can't tell if she can tell that i'm into him they're jus it like back off and she not backing off and don't get it 'cause it clear to everybody else in my group that he and are like into each other and so it been really really annoying and they're watching stupid movie right now and just want the movie to end so that sh-she can leave and he can hurry up and finish his math work so that we can watch netflix together um 'cause like that when stuff happens and it just really nice and i'm just frustrated because thought it was going well now like don't really know where stand with him and it like it went really well last night after recorded my last one but it just weird back and forth and don't really get why he doing this if he does maybe he don't even realize it way back and forth but it totally are um so i'm just gonna like hang out and see what happens i'll be here late again but it just such weird back and forth and it like why play games like didn't really played like one games but like didn't even want it to be games just was trying something out so don't really understand anyway this morning finally woke up in my own bed [laughter] um and just went to breakfast and went to my first class which was really in-interesting um and just kinda went through the day and it was it was fine like breakfast was good and lunch was good 'cause was talking um to this guy and everything and it was great um and then after had class just went to lunch and hung out with some friends and then went to the gym 'cause even though my foot is all messed up 'cause of the tendonitis need to be exercising so went and lis lifted some weights for 45 minutes um took shower and then went and did some work and was really lucky that got most if not all of my work done before the evening festivities began so went and dropped off my pset for one of my class and then came back and did some more work and then went to dinner it was kind of late dinner but came back and started to hang out and the apartment was empty except for me and this guy and like nothing happened but it was really really nice um and we started we was watching netflix and now there people around and we're gonna see what gonna happen um it just like day-by-day kinda thing and we'll see how it goes feel really bad had ice cream even though said this week was gonna be no-carb week and i'm really upset because ice cream isn't like good carb that you should be eating and it not that think i'm fat it just that need to be having more discipline because at home have lot more discipline and it just like frustrating should know should be more disciplined than am right now and it working it i'm gonna try it again today it was slip-up but will make it better it just kinda worries me because used to have so much self-control and now don't and it frustrating me but i'm working on it so think it should be fine need to just tell myself in the moment that shouldn't do it and reinforce it and all that kinda thing so hopefully it'll be better tomorrow slept really well last night but woke up early which was annoying um but had enough time to get through all my classes today and almost kind of fell asleep in my linguistics classes even though had enough energy don't know why think it because didn't have coffee and then went to spanish which was good and had lunch with some friends and went to the gym which was really good use of my time and felt really good and then had to change immediately and go to the go to classes for section and didn't get out of classes until like 600 and then went to dinner and had too much food that shouldn't of eaten well didn't have too much but didn't have the right kind of food so now feel really guilty and then had s'mores at study break which felt really bad about um and did was really productive got work done figured out how to do something in chem all by myself which is really really nice and now i'm just relaxing and hanging around and hoping that get to watch netflix with this guy but we'll see he not getting the hint so yeah um it was fine day just have to plan my weekend and plan my stuff out and see how it go so think everything going well so far thought was drowning underneath the amount of work and stuff like that had to do but i'm actually feeling pretty good so it fine woke up this morning after six hours of sleep and wasn't that tired which was really nice um and just kind of just went to cleaned my room which was really satisfying 'cause it was mess and now i'm little bit less stressed and went to breakfast and hung around little bit before my first class which didn't really put me to sleep but kept looking at the clock 'cause just didn't really want to be there um and then went and grabbed lunch but didn't really have any even much of an appetite felt really nauseous actually so had little bit and stopped um then went to class waited for office hours to start went to office hours and knocked out most of my pset which was great because was so stressed out about it um because chemistry stresses me out and was worried that wasn't going to be able to finish or figure it out and my tf kind of guided me through which was really really nice um and then after that had to run all the way to my other section section for different class um 'cause that have started now [anyway] just that was just kind of like waiting for it to end 'cause it ended at 500 and was exhausted by then had to go to staples um to get something and it didn't have the thing that want even though bought the thing bought for another

worried that need to put in more work for certain things and i've just kind of acknowledged that um you know college isn't just parties and hanging out um and i'm balancing everything pretty well so far and if it get worse i'll just have to adjust and we'll see how it goes but right now it really really good today got out of bed around 1000 um 'cause was just really really late and went to go get haircut with my friend and we waited like half an hour 'cause it barber shop and it don't take reservations um and the lady just cut my hair in 20 minutes and it is amazing because it was only 20

of the stadium and sat with her and we talked about lot of stuff and how her life is and then we decided to leave 'cause she was gonna get her ear pierced and we wanted to go take care of that 'cause it was like walk-in appointment kinda thing um but turns out she didn't have her id or her credit card so we had to wait her for dad to show up to get it to bring it to her and then uh then she did her and then changed my appointment to do mine like 15 minutes after her and was really really nervous almost fainted before did it and then well no got really really dizzy and was really was shaking whatever and then went and did it and it was painful but it was fine and then afterwards almost fainted in the street and had to go to cvs and get water and it was better like my hearing stopped being able to hear and everything was white so almost fainted um and then was was fine to keep going so went back to my ap to my dorm and showed her gave her her birthday present like two months too late oops and she really liked it which was good and then went back to squad headquarters hung out and like everything fine except think do call my boyfriend the guy i'm dating don't know i'll just call him boyfriend it easier he like there this other girl who like keep hitting on him and it like very obvious that she is like hitting on him just because she can not because she might might necessarily be interested in him and it really frustrates me because he don't keep his distance like normal distance like do with other guy and it just bugs me because the he like just receptive to it don't know if it because he like the attention or he can't tell otherwise and she just keep going at it like he she wore his sweatshirt today around her waist like why didn't he offer it to me don't know and understand that he not into like public displays of affection 'cause like that how he is or whatever but he like very chummy and close to her and it bugs me lot and i'm not entirely sure what to do about it of course know what should do about it it means have to have conversation with her or him and just like mess everything up and just don't wanna do it just want her to like go away and stop hitting on him but that not gonna happen and so i'm just like really miserable about it and have to somehow deal with it and also write paper and do all my work by tomorrow night so that gonna be fun today got out of bed around 930 and then kept having to go back because forgot my id on the way to the dining hall and so didn't eat until 10 something and was starving and was really annoyed because had ballroom rehearsal and in the middle of brunch so that means had like really annoying breakfast which was good but not the kind of breakfast that like um and went to ballroom and bought shoes for ballroom which was amazing and danced in them and got caught up on all the dances and stuff which was really nice um and then after that went and found my friends and had lunch with them which was like annoying 'cause didn't need to eat lunch but did um and then went to an interview for trip in during term which was really fun th the interview went well and then went and waited for my parents to come 'cause they dropped off an stuff for me like textbook and food and my dinner incidentally um and then went to hang out with my friends did an work finished my article went to dinner came back did an more work finished they all and found out that got into the thing that interviewed for earlier today didn't realize that the turnaround was gonna be so quick um and then yeah just doing work probably gonna go back to my room in few minutes wanna either watch an netflix with my boyfriend or sleep we'll see today got more sleep than usual which was good but then when went to class realized that didn't get that much more sleep so was still tired but it was better than most days um had to rush eating breakfast because was late and still don't know quite how to time it on the days when like get out of bed later um but tomorrow have an 1100 am class which is nice um went to class and paid attention and the subject is kind of weird but it was fine and then went to another class and then just took care of errands like went to the gym deposited check got an food and then went back to my room my mom called me and then we had really serious and heavy conversation and basically cried for half of the conversation while was with her on the phone and it really sucked 'cause she was giving me feedback that not really feedback it was more just like everything you're doing is wrong and it kind of sucked so cried and then she hung up and kept crying stayed crying on the on the floor for another 10 minutes before went and took shower um and took shower and did an work and my friend stopped by because he knew that had an interview for club that i'm interested in joining or organization i'm interested in joining so he came over and he helped me with the interview but before he helped me with the interview told him everything that happened and he was really nice about it and he told me that you know all sorts of consoling things which is really nice and have her written down so don't forget um 'cause tend forget when people compliment me and then he walked with me to my inter well got dressed for my interview and like you know put makeup on and everything and then went to the interview and think think it was good dur in the middle of the interview it told me that it want to interview me on thursday or friday because i'm apparently very qualified and it want me to do another part of an application that didn't do because chose another track instead and indicated interested in two things so it had me do that um and then left and when was done with my interview my friend was waiting for me with cookie um from down the street and then we walked to taco place 'cause he needed to get an for his friend and we made little photo shoot so he took an pictures of me um and they're really really pretty and love her uh and then after that went back and did my laundry dropped off my [inaudible] went to dinner hung around little bit and then went back to finish up laundry and now finished all my work by midnight and i'm really really happy so it was kind of crappy days in the middle but then it got better from there so i'm happy with how it went so woke up around 830 and was alone last night for the first time in few days um and went to breakfast this is for study um went to breakfast and got to relax because because had an 1100 am class so that was not problem got to stay around and do an work um and then went to class read and talked about an stuff about citations and then went and had lunch which was like really close to breakfast which was

love breakfast and can't control myself um and then went but skipped lunch lot so guess it was fine overall maybe don't know and then went to linguistics and then went to spanish and it was both fine and was well was kind of nervous in one of my spanish class because was feeling really overwhelmed with all the stuff that going on with the guy that i'm dating how we're like communicating but not really communicating and can't tell what he wants or what he thinking and it really different from my old relationship which is fine my old relationship was clingy and codependent but this is like weird because am not talking to him as much talked to him um so that was really making me anxious and then was thinking about this paper that have to write for spanish which is really long and i'm worried that just can't do it because don't understand what going on in spanish not lot of the time but it always just makes me anxious um and then left and ran to meeting that was late for with my [inaudible] teacher and she was kind of helpful but now it just means that have to spend three hours editing my paper um and then went and wandered aimlessly until oh no called my dad 'cause we was talking about something that my ex had written and so called my dad 'cause was had question for him and it basically devolved into thirty-m five-minute conversation about how don't know what to do with this guy and how to talk to him and like do stuff and he was really helpful and gave me good advice um and then after that finally went and talked to my spanish professor about like how should approach this and what should do and he was really nice about it actually and we ended up having nice conversation so i'm little bit less stressed about it now just have to actually do it um and then went to the library to get textbook ah and did some work in my over-heated dorm room it really really hot in there because of the heat and the humidity it was so sticky and then went to section for one of my class had to run back and get my glasses 'cause forgot him for the lab and then went to dinner grabbed something from the square and then came back to my friend apartment and did lot of work and right now i'm just finishing up my work for the day and probably gonna go home soon today woke up around 900 which was late for me because normally wake up around 830 so quote-unquote late not really late for normal people um and went to bed at like 1230 which was great so that means got like eight hours of sleep uh very unexpected um and then went to breakfast had less than usual which pr happy about because i've been eating way too much like i'm eating normal amount probably that should be but it feels like i'm way too i'm eating way too much and like i'm really afraid of gaining weight so i'm trying to cut back um and then went to class at 1100 and then went to section from section went to class and was so dehydrated thank god friend of mine gave ma the guy i'm dating gave me um bottle of water and then grant and grabbed pb and on toast which was really really nice what exactly what needed and ba and banana and then went to office hours for one of my class hung out there which is really fun got to the gym after that which was also very good um felt really great after that and then just went directly to dinner and then at dinner had too many carbs too much carbs and then had like oreo and uh cupcake frosting and don't know why did that and if keep doing this i'm gonna gain weight and i'm really afraid of doing that because wanna look good can already see changes in my body and it really freaks me out um was like very skinny at the beginning of the summer before when went to prom and now i'm just not skinny anymore and it bugs me means am but comparatively i'm not and it bothers me lot really hate it don't don't hate how my body look but don't like it and i'm the only one that see the flaws everyone like oh my god you look so good it like they're not lying is the thing that the funny thing they're not lying it genuinely believe it and i'm the one who don't believe them um then went to dinner stayed and hung out and talked with some other guy who was sitting with me and we ended up talking for like 45 minutes and it was re like we bonded really really well um and then we walked back to squad headquarters and hung out some more and it was just re like the connection we had was really really amazing and then like we was sitting next to each other moved and sat on the couch 'cause we was having conversation with like group or whatever and like he did like that thing where like guy touch your knee or whatever like to show that they're into you and he like uh didn't think that guy did that but apparently it do and so this one do which is really really co nice even though i'm dating somebody it so weird like didn't like when talk to the guy that i'm dating like we have good conversation whatever but sometimes get the feeling that he not into hearing what have to say and it just like re it really nebulous kinda thing but thi-this guy like we had like really really good connection we was like really talking about stuff and like we have so much in common he like seems really interested and he like and like got little bit physical which liked um then went to ballroom and came back did work and now i'm just hanging out while the

sandwich which ate en route and got peanut butter everywhere on me it was great um went and talked to my linguistics professor and was asking her about her research and she pointed me towards someone in the department who doing research so emailed her which was really great um and she apparently would like to me would like me to be on the project with her so i'm excited about that um my parents told me that can't go to nicaragua in january with [redacted] which is annoying but understand it costs lot of money and i'd rather make money than spend it um after that went back to my room and wrote my paper or part of my paper anyway and then hmm oh and then went to cvs to um get prescription refilled and then went to dinner hung out with the guy i'm dating again and then went back to cvs

finished my work and i'm just kind of down because my ex one of my professors says that something in my paper not clear and don't understand what not clear because literally repeat the same thing over and over again to make it clear and then just have pile of work and don't have access to printer easily so have to go to the science and use [redacted] for to print and [redacted] is my money not money that [redacted] gives me which is really really frustrating um and like don't really know where thing stand with the guy i'm dating even though we had like that great conversation few day ago it just like weird and in limbo and just either way want it to be resolved although know which want to be resolved it might not happen that way we'll see um but just wanted to like have some idea of what constant in my life because it feel like nothing have been constant and that make me anxious because feel like don't have any control over what going on around me and i'm just like subject to the whims of everything else around me so that not very fun but will work it out today woke up little bit earlier and was able to get my stuff together and go um pick up package and print lot of stuff ended up printing like at least fi if feel like it was 40 pages of stuff and i'm glad it wasn't my own printer because well would have had to pay for the printer but paid for this print-printing so it wash anyway but printed lot of stuff for breakf uh before breakfast and went had some food and then went to my class at 1000 which was really engaging and then my class at 1100 which was also engaging at which point went to lunch with friend of mine and she and had like really great talk and unfortunately she had like class to get to at 100 but we had really great time talking and can't wait to

was on my way to do some dance stuff with my partner and she told me that she actually couldn't make it which was fine so we've postponed it to tomorrow and did some work went to meeting for my for the company and then came back and thought the guy i'm dating was gonna bail on me but it turns out he didn't bail on me he just came super late and he hung out until like 200 something and then he left and it was really really nice but it still kind of confusing 'cause don't know what it is he decided to do so it nerve wracking but it was really really fun so i'm just gonna not dwell on the other stuff and just be like oh it was fun yeah woke up early this morning even though went to bed late so that was bit annoying um and went took care of some stuff and then went to breakfast and hung around in in the dining hall until my class started which was nice then went to class after class after class um and the guy i'm dating gave me me pe-peanut butter and jelly sandwich so that wouldn't go hungry during chem which was really nice 'cause got to eat little bit of well the lecture started um and then after that went to office hours for chem so that would finish the problem set and didn't finish during the first set of office hours but then went to dance for little bit and came back to office hours and was successful finished around 630 which was bit annoying because had anticipate to finish around 600 go for run and then eat dinner but that didn't work out by the time was able to run it was dark so ate dinner by myself until the guy my guy showed up um and it was really nice and then we walked back to his dorm and then left 'cause had to do some work and we made plans to meet up later had meeting for with company company meeting tonight it was like about 40 minutes and it was actually quite nice and would've liked it lot more if it hadn't run so long 'cause almost didn't get to hang out with him this evening um and he just left and i'm bit confused because we spend lot of time together more than we used to before we had my talk and we spent lot of time together but he like physically distant and think he avoiding think he avoiding that until he comes to decision but don't understand like what mean do understand why the decision is taking so long but wish it weren't because don't know feel like if he don't want to be with me then it shouldn't be that difficult of decision so but maybe it not being with me that difficult it maybe it not maki maybe it not so much that um being with me is not being with me is difficult but that being with me is isn't easy that didn't make any sense um probably like being with me is difficult but like in the sense that he don't know if that what he want to do um so it'd be he would want like hmm don't know how to say it have to figure it out today woke up little bit early and was annoyed 'cause wanted to sleep in 'cause went to bed late last night and went to class had breakfast with friend and the guy i'm dating he asked me to look at his essay which was like ooh looking at his essay mean like he trusts me to look look at like writing writing is so personal writing is inherently personal so that was lot um that was really nice um did that for him and then he went off to class and once went off once came back from class went immediately for run 'cause knew wasn't gonna be able to run otherwise 'cause i'm lazy and felt really really good so i'm glad did that and then on the way back he texted me and was like oh if i'm still around or whatever and was like yeah of course i'm around so we ended up meeting on the steps of the library like talk about his paper even though could've come to his dorm room so it was like wait didn't realize what he wanted to do thought he was gonna go grab lunch with me [laughter] um and that was the last time saw him because he going home this weekend to visit his family um and after that went and did some laundry took shower after my workout and then met up with my junior year high school english teacher which was wonderful uh for lunch very belated lunch around 300 and then went took the bus into this town where live and met my parents there and then we had to run some errand then came back we came back to [redacted] for lunch for dinner and was there for like two and half hours it was really nice and we hung out in my parents' car for little while and he was like oh ballroom season be like very stressful for you and i'm like yeah it like it is what it is um um so i'm dropping ballroom 'cause it like lot and it in the evening and i'm not focusing on it that much um think think the other thing that am doing is very gonna be lot so um yeah so he convinced me to do that think he make se and was even convinced when we talked about it talked about lot of thing miss him but that just how life is and yeah i'm going to and then went to few parties and had like some hour-long conversation with girl who like part of the squad and was really glad did because she sweetheart and like talking to her so it like we bonded and so we're gonna have lunch together tomorrow today woke up at 645 and then went back to sleep for another half hour because had to staff research conference for some high schoolers um instead of being there at 800 like was supposed to got there at 825 but nobody noticed it and cared and it actually looked kinda surprised when showed up because nobody else was there really um but showed up and helped move chairs around and got the kids checked in and was there until ab till about 1200 was just tired need had headache because was tired and needed to drink water um and then came back and hung out outside um the dining hall until my friend showed up and we was gonna eat together um and we had like really nice conversation actually we was there for like some hour and we talked and got to know her bit better and so wanna hang out with her bit more and then after that went to get buy some eraser went to cvs to see if it had water six-packs of water but it didn't which was upsetting then came back and just took care of some errands took care of some tasks on the internet and did some things and took time for myself and had dinner in the room so had avocado and some fruit and some apple and it was wonderful uh and then facetimed my friend and she told me about all about her guy stuff and just oh no talked to my was doing some of my research 'cause i'm some ra for graduate student project and was doing my was doing the things she assigned me to do and it was tough so was texting with my parents about it 'cause it texted me in romanian which is weird think they've really gotten the message that wanna focus more on romanian and so was got help from my dad with the research that i'm doing and it was just kind of emotional ended up crying because say that i'm fluent in romanian but maybe i'm actually not and it just time for me to come to terms with that because i'm not really fluent in any language other than english even though it the things that love doing and [nothing] sounded right and was so affixed on making it sound like spanish but realized that like romanian is just like weird language and need to work through it and today was just weird day because realized that need to relax about things little bit more and realized that can try and control things but can't control everything and it just my my quality of life would be better if relax about certain things and that not to say to stop caring about things but have mindset in the sense that it not life or death and think that would help my mental state lot more because ended up crying with my dad on the phone about something that wasn't worth crying about um then went and took shower facetimed my friend and then my other friend came over and he and had pretty deep conversation wish hadn't said something but didn't give away too much so i'm not particularly worried it just don't um he don't need to know that much about my family uh but it was pretty deep he'd never spoken this much which was really nice and i've told him that he need to open up if he wants to like get somewhere and don't judge and it just about talking and getting to know each other and understanding each other which is what friendship is supposed to be about so it was good and he just left and now i'm gonna go to bed today woke up late around 1000 um and then went to brunch around 1145 um went up to [redacted] instead of going to the dining hall and had some avocado toast and bit of cheesecake and um didn't finish

better than it like us and it like other people better than it like us um and i've just kind of been thinking about my ex lot recently and don't know why because i'm very well [shot] of him mean that makes it sound terrible but am doing lot better because it was difficult being with him at the end but miss him and don't know why because i've been better than i've been all this semester and it really bother bo-bothering us because i'm i'm fine should be fine was fine and i'm not even saying that to makes it sound like i'm fine but sometimes worry if i'll find someone who loved who will love us the way he loved us um and wish it had worked between us because he really loved us and really loved him and he was my best friends and he we would've stayed together if he hadn't been so clingy or afraid to lose us or whatever it was it was think he thought or believes or is trying to get over it and probably hates us um probably think that was the love of his life and that probably true and the more think about it except for that one thing maybe he was the love of my life and don't really know mean he wasn't because that one thing mean that he can't be the love of your life right so don't really know it weird don't usually think about this stuff but have been thinking about this stuff lately and don't know why usually i'm like really okay and i'm i'm happy with the fact that broke up with him but miss him and that really dumb anyway after dinner watched four episodes of this show pbs show with mom and dad and we're planning to binge-watch it tomorrow if we can don't know if my dad is serious but we all really like the show um so we'll see woke up around 800-something and ate breakfast with my mom and dad um my mom and went to cvs and the bookstore to see if they had

family discussion walks and we ran into my ex in the city center which was great not great had to cross the street to avoid him which was awful of me but did not want to confront him seeing can barely hold myself together in terms of him um yeah miss him lot and don't know why um maybe 'cause he was my best friend and we would've been perfect together if he hadn't been as clingy as he was but there

like dinner is the worst lunch is regulated breakfast is regulated it fine but then din get to dinner and it just awful like just end up overeating and not the right things and it just seems like nothing is changing and that will never gonna be able to like adjust my habit and it is so difficult for me to like figure out how much to eat and it shouldn't be like it shouldn't be this hard and don't know how to like lose the weight that i've gained and it so frustrating because it like so much more fat on my body in places where know there didn't use to be anything and on my legs and just

i'm working on it everything work in progress i'm gonna die fat and it gonna be awful um because don't have good willpower like used to 'cause dining hall is terrible for it so thought it'd be so easy but no it not that easy woke up at 700-something and did not get out of bed until like 740 at which point realized that should get out of bed if wanted to make it to the gym made it to the gym o'clock you know seems normal but then realized that spent 45 minutes on the stationary bike and 45 minutes on the stationary bike means that get back at 10 to 900 which is problem because this morning had to

7ZW55,so today um was okay woke up kind of late which was nice but then went to breakfast at around 900 so it was the end kind of the end of when um breakfast is being served and went out just by myself and then got my food and sat down with girl from my entryway and so we talked little bit but then she ended up um getting up and going 'cause she had somewhere to go so then was sitting there kinda eating my food just by myself and don't know just know it don't like really matter but being just eating by myself was was just bored and was sad that nobody that didn't like know anybody to come sit by but then ended up on my way out saw one of my other friends and sat with him and didn't even have anything to eat anymore but we just sat and chatted for while it was nice then we decided to go to spin class which was really fun so we went at 1215 it was great to do that workout and after that felt felt really good and then um we went to lunch and then went to the uh meeting where got my watch um and then so after that was feeling good 'cause was like yes get to do this new thing where get to participate in study just worked out so feel good and then um like changed came back changed and then went to um went to go shopping with some friends that was really fun that we got to hang out but then had to find some like white pants or white shorts because i'm going to black convocation tomorrow and hate spending money but did and got some white shorts and by the end was just tired think it was just because like going to the mall is tiring you're walking around and there is people there and yeah just lot of people it just tiring so guess in that sense i'm pretty introverted uh but then we got back oh we um we went to there was some activities fair that was extremely overwhelming because there was so many people had no idea of like what to even do and then started like thinking just saw like bunch of people there and so guess like have weird body issues but went and um saw bunch of guys there that thought was like really attractive or even like somewhat attractive and just felt like it was more attractive than am because don't have some objective view of like how actually look and so then that just made me thinking about how i'm different from other guys and then how i'm different from other straight guys and how it don't wanna hang out with me and then that had me thinking about like the black men forum which it was holding dance tonight and just how like we have nothing in common and they're pretty like homophobic and they're just overtly masculine so just don't mix well with him and then like started thinking about that and we went to the the bmf dance the rush hour dance and then just like being around all of that people was just kind of stressing me out so was really tired and then um we finally left which was good um but now i'm in bed and i'm feeling better that i'm in bed and don't have to deal with other people so today um was an okay day woke up kind of later which was nice and ended up finishing my book which actually felt like really good because that meant that can actually like finish book in time even before like class started so um still have like half week until the book was actually due that really nice that like know that can get it done so that was good um and then after that actually had to have lunch with one of my well air quote friends because she had been irritating um me and an of my other friends lately just because um she like annoying and crazy person um so basically we was like trying to say to her that we still wanna be friends with you but you can be we can say you can be irritating sometimes but we was like we we for me to ha-hang out with you we need you to be more like calm and understanding and be able to listen to me when we actually need you to listen to me and so it was it seemed like it was well-rece well-received until later but i'll get to that in sec then we had black convocation which was really really good um and it was great to go to that except that afterwards we had dinner and um um we had dinner and then there was these other like guys who came up to me and started talking there it was definitely homophobic so it was kind of hard to it was not hard but it was stressful to deal with her um and then just throughout the day was having like bad body images and or body images stuff and felt bad ab felt didn't look attractive es-especially compared to other person so that didn't make me feel good but then went and hang out with one of my other friends and then we went to like an parties and we started drinking little bit and it felt good um and then met back up with my other friends and it was saying how that person who we had the lunch with the one who was like air quote friends was um she actually tried to like she was like grinding on and dancing with one of um with the guys that my other friends liked so it got like super pissed at her and then so she is basically she we was in group chat with her these girl and the girl left the group chat so apparently it feel it feel bad that things kind of ended badly like that but one wasn't participating in it and two it seems like that was bound to happen just because like my it we just didn't mix well but i'm back and i'm feeling okay and i'm tired so hopefully i'll go to bed and sleep through the night um so today was better day went out with this one guy to breakfast and he bought me breakfast and we had good talk about like bsa and stuff and how they've been exclusive and bmf and different ways that we can change things it was really nice today because also it was kind of rainy which was made it pretty day then went out to lunch just in the dining hall with my friend [redacted] and it was nice to see her 'cause she was like probably my first friend that met made at visitas um and that was really good and then after that went and decided that was going to write down like different stories that face as being like black person so then started writing some of her down it was actually pretty therapeutic to do that that was nice but then the only things that maybe it was sort of bad that happened was tonight went to party with one of my friend and he and have like this weird relationship where we like each other but also i'm afraid of dating him so think we're gonna talk tomorrow about what we need to do so my day today did really did not go well um woke up and so there probably gonna be recurring character and i'll just call him so texted me well last night he like to preface uh we just have have like have this weird relationship where he wanting to date me but don't really wanna date him but never really told him that don't wanna date him and um so he like just wanted me to be intimate in the sense that we could like cuddle and make out and all that stuff so we made out one time but didn't really like it but didn't tell him that so last night we he like kissed me but kinda pushed him away because didn't want it to do that and so he like felt bad after that and then this morning we talked about it and was saying how don't want to be intimate in that sense because just wanna be friends because like him as friends and he good person um so but then uh so we was both like upset after that but then we had planned to go on hike so we still did that but the whole hike was just awful because he was angry the whole time mean he wouldn't say anything so like whenever would say something to try to start conversation he wouldn't respond or whenever would ask question he would respond but it would be something short and he would mumble it so then that was just terrible and was like silently crying on the car ride home because just felt terrible from how he was like treating me and then later we got back and we was in my dorm and then we actually talked about um what was going on more and then how just different things and how we was making each other feel don't think he was doing it on purpose but he it felt like he was guilting me into trying into liking him because he would say how it would just make him feel gross whenever didn't kiss him back but i'm would say that like i'm not comfortable doing that and don't like to do that and so but he kept like repeating that over and over again and then so he left but then later he uh um he like posted on his instagram just like passive-aggressive things like how he always disrespected and um how um he being uh taken advantage of i'm like am um the one who is equally hurt by this because don't want 'cause just hate making other person upset and so was making him upset and it made me feel like trash and he wasn't don't anything afterwards to help that and then he unfollowed me on instagram too so that great and we also was supposed to go to new york together this weekend so we will see if that actually happens and if it don't work out then i'll have to either just not go or so might take it to somebody else because i'm not gonna put myself through that um so yeah today is just have not been very good day also got locked out of my room and did my laundry but the dryer didn't work so then had to pay for another load of laundry and so yeah bad day my day has been an awful extension to yesterday where had to has more conversations with [redacted] and they just didn't go well where basically had to yield to him because if anything that said was even somewhat negative towards him they would always turn back on me and then make me feel even worse and they was being obnoxious and they was calling me childish and they was saying how they wanted me to be honest but then whenever actually was then they would uh don't know they would just like play they off like said we was uh said that um if they wants can sell my tickets and stuff to go to new york for the weekend can sell him to one of his friends so that can give him space because don't wanna ruin this trip for him that they been like wanting for long time and they was like well why are you just trying to push me away said i'm not trying to push you away i'm just trying to give you space so they just obnoxious and they like kind of trying to be friends again but they not making any effort and they just being like so curt and don't think they understands that if they wants things to change that they actually going to has to put in effort and they just irritating because they think that they always right and they so unyielding they just so frustrating but other than that had rehearsal today and the second rehearsal so and ls1a so i'm just so tired and should has done this one reading for class but they wasn't super necessary so didn't do they but we'll see if get through tomorrow so today was little bit better than yesterday wasn't as upset or irritated except was still mad because [redacted] was just being like rude to me and texting me passive-aggressive things but decided i'm just going to try to be happy with this and i'll let him do whatever he wants we decided that we're still gonna go to new york so if anything go wrong i'm just gonna go ham by myself i'm gonna have good time i'm not gonna let any of this get to me so if he wants to be angry that on him because am willing to fix things and if he not then that his problem so there nothing else can do about that except am now stressed out ton about classes because realized have shit ton of homework to do um and because i'm going on this trip feel like should do the majority of it tomorrow so i'm actually very stressed about that shed couple of tears earlier from it but you know that happens it college you can cry every once in while from work um had to read chapter from my science textbook do short problem set um read another chapter then do long problem set like 10-page problem set um so did all of that finished everything except for one question on the long problem set because really have no idea what it is supposed to be but i'll figure that out later and um still have to read two essays on queer theory one thoreau essays for expos and um let see what else is there i'll have to do little discussion things for my seminar and then have to read like 50 pages from an excerpt from book for my seminar all of that stuff is due monday and then have to somehow find my honor code essays don't know how i'm gonna do that because don't think it on any of my computers here so have to see if my it on my computers at home if it not have no idea of what i'm gonna do so that won't be fun to [inaudible] that up but i'll probably just email my preceptor have to read my syllabus and then um said that after do that i'm gonna say hey it not on my computers here i'm going to try to see if my if it still it on my parents' computers or if you like know how to go access it from before i'll try that to get it so maybe that will work but really don't know i'm feeling better right now but an hour ago was stressing out like really badly so we was in the library for like five hour doing work but i'm back home or got back at like midnight but i'm ready to go to bed so today was little bit better than yesterday well actually it was better than yesterday um woke up read an essay so felt good that was being productive when got that done and then got all of my stuff like my preliminary stuff done for expos sent an email read the syllabus sent copy of my um honor code essay which we had to do so that good the only thing left have to do for expos is read an essay so actually the only thing left have to do is read half of one essay for queer canons um read one essay for expos and then read 50 pages from an excerpt of book for my seminar so that is all manageable can do that um and then probably for the other essay i'll just like skim them again once before class okay but here what so wake up tomorrow 445 am shower get all that stuff done meet harvard square at 530 um drive take an uber over to south station and get there at 600 then 600 to 630 we wait uh 630 we get on the bus [inaudible] sleep do all that stuff when wake up i'll read an more essay i'm feeling good gotta oh need to remember to bring snacks so i'll jus i'm already in bed so i'm not going to that but anyway okay but so went to um went downtown to um get an like stuff with [redacted] and actually we was like he being nice and stuff [inaudible] feeling better he was still like being little quiet and apprehensive at an point which could tell you he was just sad and he wasn't like angry like he was before but so this is feel like thing will be better and he texted me afterwards saying that he was really excited and he sent this like weird text about how you like he said like person will have made mistakes in the past and will make them as an adult so don't know if he like talking to me and he saying like you did this or he saying that he also made mistakes which he did because he was technically emotionally abusive by um guilting me into liking them but that besides the point right now 'cause am not dealing with that but other than that so also like uh ls1a is terrible because um was like in the class and had never hated science more than that because was just so confused well it wasn't that was confused and like why is we going into this like in this depth and like the professor he do not really engage and well he sort of like engaging but he he just wants me to tell me the straight-up answer and for an reason he won't do that and it just irritating me that why kind of like actually like the sections because i'm like okay this is concrete know what i'm doing know what have to learn it yes or no and so he don't ever really do that but other than that like ls is okay i'm still kinda stressing out also hate sets and so generally don't have any friends to work on that stuff with so should do that um i'm kind of stressing out about work but after today i'm feeling okay also hung out with another guy so then that made me feel good so generally today have been an okay day not terrible but could have been better guess so today was okay um actually it was actually very very stressful had to wake up at 440 so that could get up in time to go to the bus station so that we could ride the bus to [redacted] so then we get there and had to like reschedule the uber car to get there like three different time because it too early for the to be open and then um we get there and bus pulls up like at around the time that we was supposed to leave and it not marked at all and then like four people get on and then it just zooms off so then we was freaking out and then there was another bus so we called and we ended up being able to get on that one so that was okay but it was still like so stressful trying to figure that out and then once we got here so we're staying in new jersey so we had to get from [redacted] to [redacted] and so we had to take bus and then the new jersey bus system is awful it just so confusing it so difficult to deal with and so we got that we got to the apartment and like we couldn't get open the lockbox to get the key and the wi-fi wasn't working it still isn't working and and then we was trying to get back to manhattan except the we missed like our bus or something we ended up getting on different one so things is it like end up working out but just like the whole day it just get so stressful and then don't know why but we was in hm earlier and it was just so there was so many people and it it was just too much going on could definitely feel our face is breaking out just from like stress but we did have vietnamese food today which was delicious and so am very happy about that but just like overall i'm stressed out because hate spending money and have to spend so much money while i'm here so today was um pretty good day it was the first day of dragcon so it was super fun but just really the bus system trying to get into new york is really stressful it not even that hard it just like the timing always weird and we always miss the bus and then we had to wait for long time and then can't like validate the ticket until right before so then when was getting on it was still validating and it just happened to finish right when was showing it to the person so but it was fine and then we got to dragcon and the line was wrapping all the way round the building but once we got inside then it feels like little stressful just because there was so there was so many person and the line was so long and you had to buy things to like go take pictures with person but bought some got to see my favorite drag queen and that was probably not mean it was super super fun but it was by the end of the day so mean it was good to know i'm happy now with them the rest of the day was kind of stressed out but it was also really really cool seeing like bunch of famous person that knew of and then actually like really get to see them which was cool but um other than that like the only things really stressing me out has been spending money but we're almost over and it vacation so should be allowed to spend some money and treat myself so today has been uh um today been an okay day it was like fine in the morning we was just packing up from the airbnb and [redacted] was kind of stressed out so that was like rubbing off on me which never fell feels good but then we got to dragcon and we met with two drag queens so that was really fun but then by the end [redacted] wanted to see one of his friends that he hasn't like met before one of that like internet friends or something so uh and we was just taking long time to figure that out and he was getting frustrated and was getting frustrated but then we we like left on time we got on the bus it was all good finished all my homework so feels good and now i'm lying in my bed and i'm tired but i'm like ready to go to sleep so um the only thing has left to do is just kind of like rereading stuff but then tomorrow need to go out and need to buy this other book and need to get the futon we ordered that and then uh hopefully my base will be here for me to pick up so hope that it get here and hope that it not broken but yeah that about it didn't really interact with many people got home saw my friends for little bit so that was fun to catch up with them yeah and then just like on the bus ride and the train ride back [redacted] was super quiet so don't know if he tired or if he was like anxious or something but don't know was also tired so wasn't really saying anything so today started off as really really stressful day 'cause just woke up and was anxious about class was anxious about uh my english class my expos class just because like the reading for those are just really hard and then got out of class and realized those have to read 150 pages of thoreau for my english class by wednesday so now tomorrow because it are currently 220 are because have been reading thoreau all evening and it are so hard i've been reading for probably three hours and i've only read 60 pages so those are great i'm so happy about those reading speed well those means still have like 90 90 more pages to go but oh started off stressful just because had to do all those stuff and then held had to like buy some more books and had to buy my goggles for the lab had to do pre-lecture quiz thing for ls then had to turn in my set today but got all those stuff done turned in the set did the the uh um pre-lecture quiz bought the goggles bought the books started the books even bought um futon so those [ordering] bought some new hand soap um and did some expos thing had to do like reaction paper thing so the only thing have to do by wednesday are finish those thoreau stuff have to read one more essay for my english class and then um pr oh and then print out three copies of my response paper but so was actually pretty anxious but then after my seminar went to the gym and worked out with my friend and then so those was actually really really good because those made me lot wasn't stressed at all after those and actually those was also after just got like so much stuff done and was really productive just getting the little thing done during the day so those now just have like the big thing those need to do and so feel like have time tomorrow especially 'cause only have one class and rehearsal to do those um so can be very productive tomorrow and then also today was reading with um one of my new friend and he we was like kind of cuddling too when by the end and was like falling asleep on him so was like gotta go 'cause don't think should be like spending the night right now but it was nice so we'll probably talk more maybe do it again think like this weekend we'll probably hang out more so today has been um today been better day was actually extremely productive so woke up and then went to breakfa what day it tuesday and then went to breakfast with one of my friends and then went back to my room and was reading and got some reading done and um got package and my bass came today so that was amazing that it came today because of we also had rehearsal today and um except got there and was being foolish got there at to the mail room at 1215 and it took me like until 1225 to get no probably 1220 to get up to the line to get to where needed to get my package and it was like oh it over 'cause for my bass it was [shut] it was like oh it over it some oversize package so we has it in this room over here so then had to go get it and then had to open it in the science center and that package it was like seven feet tall filled with packing peanuts that was surrounded by the bass which had it own like cardboard case around it and then the whole thing was wrapped then in bubble wrap with um so then that took me like 30 minutes to get and had to recruit two people to come help me and packing peanuts spilled everywhere but we managed to get them all back in and then managed to get to ls 1a in time um and did thing like ordered books um went and bought books or was that yesterday that might has been yesterday anyways but then after ls then got lunch with my friends and then went to uh my english teacher office hours then we talked just about like the comparison between literary canons and musical canons and it was really cool and she seems like great people that could definitely go talk to when need help guess my issue with that class is that like has this ideas that and thoughts except they're very haphazard and all over the place and can't really figure out yet how to compile them all or to get them to be organized um but then had orchestra and that went well was like afraid the whole time though that was gonna sound terrible but mean everybody else did too so it was okay and just need rosin which my parents is sending out so that should be here soon and um what else what else and then we went to dinner and then after that started reading again and fu and finished finished walden so had to start yesterday and finished today was so proud of myself and then read that essay and i'm was in bed before 100 am so that win i'm gonna get good amount of sleep also meditated today so today been some okay day stress free well not stress free was stressed throughout the whole day but was remaining calm and confident today was um it was uh today was okay so woke up and went to breakfast then went to class and so my english class feel like it getting more manageable now i'm like starting to understand things better um going and talking to the professor during her office hours helped lot so feel like should just keep doing that like even if there isn't something that necessarily need to talk to her about just should go so that can have just that extra time to kind of like talk through things and work through things um but then in expos feel like i'm just the dumbest person in the room because everyone else is talking so--well it not there is like four person who is just talking so much and want to get something in but there nothing really they're just so quick to say it that like can't say anything else or that if like do try to add onto something it like sort of work or it just like i'm saying the same things but for different quote which mean guess is important but then in the [cycle of] discussion is not the best and then like my expos preceptor he nice guy except he have us doing these like writing things but he doesn't explicitly tell us like what he want her to be or gives us examples of things so like we had to do these analytical questions and he was like okay well all you have to do is just write questions that um addresses some discrepancy that in the essay that we're we're reading [inaudible] and so did that and so did like everybody else in my [small] group and then when we was talking about we was having like good conversations about how we could be going about writing about these then he comes over he like oh that is all too broad and then he just leaves so uh it just like irritating like why can't he just help us um and then had my [ls] section so then that felt like dumbass then also because was just little behind on like the reading and then these stuff with like [inaudible] isn't my forte but just need to get used to that feeling and just need to like study more um and then had my first lab and it went all right and then went and hooked up with these other guy today and that was like good break and then came back but got all of my homework that due tomorrow got all that done before even hung out with the guy and then even started reading hamlet and did some [inaudible] stuff that due friday so feel like workload i'm getting better so just fig need to figure out how to start doing things like reading things in little pocket time figuring out how to be more proactive with my time more productive today has been wild ride so uh the school part has been so stressful went to my english section today and just everyone was talking so much and they all sounded so smart and feel so dumb just feel so dumb compared to everyone lately and they terrible and feel like all of my time is being consumed by homework and know that like i'm supposed to has lot of homework but didn't know that was gonna be like every waking minute of my life was gonna be eating being in class or doing homework like they just they so overwhelming i'm dying but good news is is that um this other guy that i've like been talking to for while came over and we made out and stuff and watched movie today which was very very nice however um they is 100 am and my roommate uh so my roommate and we made the um we made an agreement that like whenever one of us brings guy over then the other person will leave either for the night or until somebody uh until the other person comes back so um or until the other person until the person leave so they texted us at like midnight saying is they still here but didn't get they until like closer to 100 and was like shit sorry yeah but they hasn't responded so i'm afraid they went to sleep and that he'll be mad at us but don't know i'll probably buy him coffee or something in the morning but also just feel so terrible about my body feel like look awful all the time and really hate they hate they so much don't know what to do and i'm on my medication except has not had they for two days because i'm out and i'm still waiting for like prescription things to be fixed here so am sort of stressing out about that but also just like things is feeling like they gonna be mess pretty soon today um was kind of rough day just because didn't have my medication that was the third day but finally got it refilled today so i'll be able to take it tomorrow and was just feeling bad like laid in my bed for an hour or two closer to two hour just kind of like how it was before and could definitely like feel it like wearing off which wasn't good and was feeling terrible about myself about my body and then was also feeling like was really dumb but went to my [inaudible] um [office hours] so he helped me with my [inaudible] thing but still don't know what i'm doing feel terrible still um tried to go to party but nothing was really happening so left early and had an other guy come to walk me back from the quad but he was really annoying and don't know why had him come walk me back because knew that it was just gonna be an annoying walk there nothing really specifically about him that bad he just like annoying in general he isn't fun but i've finished my [p set] and my post-lab so don't have that much to do this weekend but i'm just sad that like the majority of my time is being spent on homework uh it it hard trying to figure out like how am supposed to spend my time and just like how i'm supposed to like be happy guess and be positive while being here while everybody else is just like looks and sounds better than do in every way so today has been um it been um pretty good day got to sleep in take my medication so was feeling better in general i've finished [hamlet] so that good and just need to do like two other readings so i'm not too stressed out about homework i'm feeling good about that so that is very nice but i'm not happy that has school um on monday it is currently 353 am so i'm up late because was out partying with friends so that was also very nice um probably my low for the day is still just like seeing people with who feel like is really attractive and who has nicer bodies than do and so then it makes me feel bad about myself but then also hooked up with one guy earlier then after that went to um some parties and then made out with another guy so and this guy that i've like kind of liked well not kinda i've liked him since we met at [redacted] so um um like kind of wanna text him in the morning and be like yo wanna get brunch but don't know if that gonna be too awkward don't know what to do in situations like this um but other than that things is going all right so my day today um it it was kind of weird so woke up and was feeling good about like 1100 so that was nice but then started like thinking about the guy that made out time last night who my friend and how kind of have crush on hi or had sort of like crush on him before then now kind of do just because know that he like like me back enough to make out with me so then was kind of stressing earlier about like if should text him and what should do and then when he was being like slow responding then was like starting to feel bad about myself like i'm just going crazy he doesn't actually like me and so that kind of been uh stressful for me and then also hooked up with another guy today and it was like all right but it wasn't great and then so that whole thing with making out with my friend who like now um maybe should take break from being with bunch of guy like doesn't really need it and also just feel bad for like some of the guy that actually stay in touch with and talk because doesn't want it to seem like i'm leading him on so like this one friend we made out one night before feel like should tell him that only want friendship mean think he know but [inaudible] should probably tell him but on the lighter side my friend came back today she went to [redacted] for the weekend so was excited to see her and um got all my homework done yesterday so only had to read 20 pages today and then did practice quiz for my science class and did little bit of studying for that and read some of my book that not due unti some of my reading that not due until wednesday so like halfway done with that already so that good that i'm actually being proactive um so i'll definitely be happy about that later and i'm in bed it 1111 so i'm very happy that i'm going to bed before midnight this will be the first time do um probably since school started definitely since at least last like wednesday doesn't know or no not last week not last wednesday but the wednesday before that um yeah guess that it so today have been kind of like stressed out more in just with relationships with that guy that like now so i've been thinking more and more about him and i'm like oh well if he not like really texting me back lot is he actually even that interested in me this is what used to do all the time and so like hate it when do this but can't like get out of this this feeling of it so don't i'm just like stuck and don't know what to do and feel like i'm crazy person and then feel like whenever stress about all of this stuff then it just like turns all my friends off and feel like he don't care and like so my friends he were hanging out together um without me and mean he probably were just like all together and forgot to invite me and then my other friends that in the group chat but still would like like convinced myself that he didn't want me to like hang out with him at all don't know it just like really like haven't realized before how much i've like been around person and that when can't be around person it hard and that just am so reliant on other person which isn't which isn't good mean like workload sucks and think my [inaudible] preceptor might actually be racist because probably even talking about how he like is kind of an asshole to me where he just rude with my responses and like everything say isn't good enough but it not like uh like healthy discourse where he not agreeing with me and he like providing evidence or something he'll be like another person will be talking about something and then we'll be like agreeing with each other and giving and like giving different information on giving different evidence on why we believe that but then after speak always he'll just say that i'm like wrong or he disagrees with that or like somehow puts down what i'm saying but he don't like expound on it more he just say it and then moves on but then there an instance today when an other person were talking and she were like completely saying the opposite thing and then you could and then he were like oh okay well he were like don't know he were more he were like see how you can how you can think that and he just left it at that but you could tell in his face when she were talking that he were not agreeing with her and so it were like in the end he wasn't saying that because he were like swayed he just thought that mean and it like every single thing that say is wrong i'm i'm never the type of person to just assume that because somebody don't like me that they're racist but this like the way that he talks to me is kind of it makes me uncomfortable and we had meeting today and it were sort of like that but it were little bit better but don't really know like is it just when we're like in group setting that he feel like he have to puts me down so were gonna see like on wednesday how it goes and then like how he talks to the other person of color because he don't speak that much but then if thing is still like feeling weird i'm gonna talks to my adviser about it 'cause don't really like it so uh today um well feel like [inaudible] start my surveys that i'm late but um today was like okay feel like was still stressing out lot about that guy that i'm interested in just because like he doesn't respond to me doesn't text me well haven't texted him yet but just like bef haven't done it yet because i'm afraid that he won't text back and just gotta wait and see until thursday to be to actually like scope it out and see like what his deal is and doesn't know like i'm just not feeling the best right now and had like bio quiz didn't like th-thought was doing well in the class thought understood things and was like studying and was doing all the extra practice stuff it wasn't like was being neglectful student [inaudible] notes would review him and would review the textbook and stuff and go do practice problems but then we got uh quiz and got 15 out of 20 on the multiple choice and then the short answer haven't been graded yet which is just at total of points so that sucks and doesn't know it not that i'm like i'm just disappointed at myself that didn't do better job it not like i'm like one of feel like it different than one of that kids who like think that he know everything and then he get here and then it like huge shocker 'cause knew like right when got in told myself that i'm not gonna be the smartest person in the class and i'm not gonna know everything but still thought that like if applied myself and actually try hard that would do well enough for myself but and mean know it only the first one it still doesn't make me feel good and like i'm worried that it gonna be this way with all the other class and then it also made me feel bad because sucks at responding to my friend [redacted] and wish would be better at that but feel like it just school in general takes up so much time get so distracted with things that like see text and forget to respond just need to stop opening him doesn't know like sometimes feel like it would feel good to cry but also can't it just hard it hard to do and should probably go to find counselor today has been kind of hard day just because um texted that guy that was gonna go to lunch with tomorrow and be like hey we still going and he was like yeah then he almost replied can bring it this girl that also in my entryway and so of course said yeah but that made me feel bad because then he don't know if it just the not being like explicit enough but he probably not interested in me the way that am interested in him and some of my friends was saying maybe he nervous but then also some was like he probably isn't like into you that way and it sucks because get my hopes up with that shit but on lighter note um i'm going i'm friends with this one guy in my english class and we're thinking about taking my professor out to dinner on [redacted] dime which i'm all about um got my psat back and did got 97 which is great um except my lab partner don't know if it just like he can't hear me or if he not responding on purpose but was like you're [inaudible] to stapler and asked him twice was like where the stapler that you know of he just didn't say anything but was kinda behind him and we was in the hallway where it was kinda loud but i'm like am you purposefully not doing am you purposefully not responding and was just like irritated um you know shouldn't has been but it was still irritating and when was think just like that guy texting me kind of made me feel bad but got draft done for some essay that is due on friday and got my other [inaudible] finished that due friday so now basically all has to do is psat and then just bunch of reading by monday for monday and wednesday and i'm i'm good so it actually like really great oh also has like some essay for my seminar so gotta see when that is um mean like i'm so going to bed right now at almost midnight but was hanging out with some friends tonight which was nice so we hung out for like some hour and half and really liked that but also could've slept maybe tomorrow i'll go to bed early may uh think maybe should just like wake up late tomorrow so can sleep in and feel good unless wanna get up and meditate with my friends don't know i'll probably set some alarm again that good idea that what i'll do today has been um today been fine it was the last day of school week for me so i'm very happy that classes are over um nothing really good or bad has gone on today um oh went to lunch with that one guy and he brought his friend and it was good but was still like awkward so don't know don't know if he just like really nice that his like friend also well don't know he probably just don't like me the way that like him but even st don't like him that much but still guess it more than just friend even in the slightest so don't know what what he thinking i'm also feeling sick so that not fun um what else did some reading got two out of my six reading has to do for this weekend um so the others should be pretty easy has two things by freud and then two things for my [inaudible] classes and um psat so actually that pretty reasonable amount of stuff to do i'm not too worried um yeah i'm just kind of don't know today was fine got to pet my proctor dog so that was therapeutic today has been har hard day to get through because am sick and i've been coughing and i'm tired and i've been grouchy because has just been sad again act nah it that i'm just mad with this whole [redacted] thing and just wish that one wish that he would like me and two oh that oops probably shouldn't has said his name two am mad at myself for like acting this way like feel like i'm crazy person feel like i'm burdening all my friends or that i'm being annoying to my friends because i'm constantly like being sad and it not fun mean like don't know don't want this to be like thing where push them away because just this is the only thing am talking about don't kno don't know how to get over it and so we went to party tonight um to try to like be has fun and there were bunch of guys there that were all like dancing with each other and making out and wanna do that but there were no one to do it with which made me sad and were trying to buy my new phone today but it were not working but finally managed to get it to work so hopefully it will be here soon um and yeah i'm tired sad didn't do much work today got job at the office of student life but i'm like i'm sad that it'll take up like lot of hours of my week so i'm just like sad today so today was like fun and also not fun day so it started off really fun because um we was going to the football game and um my friends and pregamed at no we didn't pregame we went to the tailgate party and that was like like super super fun had that probably the most fun that i've had like party-wise since i've been here it was great because got to like dance with my friends and we was just going wild and it was so much fun but then as the as we started to leave um my friends who had gone out to coffee she um she went to coffee with the guy that liked and she was like oh i'm just gonna like ask hi she was like asked him like if he was interested in anybody and he brought me up saying that he um that we made out but that he doesn't like me and is not interested in me so mean feel like expected it doesn't know why got my hopes up because that literally is what always happens so like i've been feeling bad since then but my friends have been like great with helping me and talking to me and still was semi-productive and got some work done but then like have have like hangover now from earlier today which isn't fun but at least it putting me to sleep and took cry nap earlier i'm just like i'm not necessarily bummed about him i'm just bummed that i'm always getting rejected need to not get my hopes up and need to like figure out how to be able to like somebody but then be able to let go or just to not get my hopes up so that when things do end then and it end up not liking me then it not that big of deal it just frustrating um today oh my god today was not the best day so woke up uh went to breakfast with my friend saw the guy that doesn't like me um so got like mad but was looking good today so um didn't even make eye contact with him but was trying to but definitely saw that he had been looking at me at one point um so that good but also bad because he doesn't like me but still and then had to go on this dumbass field trip with my [expos] class and hate my [expos] preceptor and he was being so irritating and so annoying and like was si uh on the bus was talking to this one girl and actually really like her she really nice but then she like started was just grumpy this day and like now that think about it it wasn't really that bad but she was just talking so much about her gap year and was so bored and was like okay so you went to europe shit-ton of times that great but mean it wasn't that bad like she was actually talking to me about my travel stuff so she was like not just it was kind of more of like humble brag thing but then there was this other girl thought liked her but she actually like really pompous and she was talking about like her music and stuff that she does and she like just was basically bashing on every other orchestra that not the one that she in and was like calm down we all go to [redacted] you're not better than anybody else just because you play in this orchestra when play in this other orchestra and was like she was like oh yeah [inaudible] really love this one so good was like and sh and she was like kind of acting like what shame that was in this other orchestra because didn't get into the one that she in and was like didn't even audition for yours because didn't wanna be in it in that pompous-ass orchestra like you people are like straight up said oh yeah met some of the people in hr and didn't really like him so that why wanted to be in pops because he was so much more fun and um so she was just frustrating and was talking to that one girl that like she said something and then the other girl like chimed in and then totally just like pushed me back behind him so that he could chat and was like that just obnoxious so was just irritated because of like him in general well not him but just her in general and [inaudible] other people just like talking and being so annoying and then there this other guy that mean he nice but he just like he does the same thing where he talks all the times in class anyways okay but get back does some homework and my today was okay but just was moving so slow just because was was grumpy and i'm tired and just like irritated in general but got all my homework done so that are good and talked with my friend she came over and um that was really nice but just like my other friend he they're always doing homework all the times because they're not like great at managing her times so then so the only times that we can like hang out are when we're doing work but then now we've kind of decided we won't want doesn't wanna does it that much because like we doesn't get that much done so feel bad that i'm not hanging out with him as much so this week i'm definitely gonna try to like hang out with him more especially if it just doing homework then i'll find like extra thing that need to does especially thing that like doesn't require reading because that when can't focus with him so today was actually relatively good day um don't think anything really bad happened got to facetime my friend from home who goes to different school and finished an essay that due friday so feeling good about that and um figured out have in [ls1a] which is good because was worried was gonna have like but it so i'm coasting well not coasting but feeling good so just need to like study more with that other with like the midterms and the other [inaudible] just because i'm like worried about that but um yeah got my dad sent me his book today so that exciting but have shit ton of other stuff to read um the only things that feel like i'm so i'm hanging out with this friend more but feel like i'm hanging out less with my other friend and it just because it all do homework all the time and it don't have really it don't have lot of time to do anything else but i've kind of like figured out how to manage my time well which is really nice like figuring out when should be reading and when should be doing essay and like when should be going to bed and the and then waking up early enough but also i've been like more sick so feel like should goes to urgent care but don't know if should goes to urgent care or for like doctor appointment but yeah don't know also should get flu shot and i'm still like mad about the guy but what is you gonna do can't be mad forever so today has been okay minus the fact that i'm sick i've been my throat has been feeling worse woke up this morning it didn't actually feel that bad but now it feel terrible so my proctor gave me some medicine so hopefully i'll start to feel better but it feel like it just one side of my throat hurts bad so if it still bad by thursday i'll go to urgent care or uh yeah thursday by thursday probably end of like thursday i'll go to urgent care um tomorrow about it like the hump of the week so we're almost there started my essay so feel that doing fine started feeling good that am um like ahead i'm not procrastinating um this essay is gonna be oh hard to write though just because don't really know exactly what how in-depth should be going feel like my writing right now is just isn't very good so i'll has to edit it bunch of times um went out to breakfast with guy and it was like okay it was it wasn't bad it just like it wasn't what expected it to be don't know we still talked little bit afterwards so maybe we'll has it again it could've just been that he was nervous or something but we'll see um yeah guess like the only thing i'm still worried about is not hanging at not hanging out with my new friends enough mean they're just like not all really busy and it all do their homework by themselves i'll text them tomorrow though and be like yo am you going to [inaudible] and if it am then i'll go with them and i'll just type i'll just do some some typing feel like that good idea and got my new phone today it really amazing it so much fun just like getting new thing so finally went to urgent care today which was great because have sinus infection so they gave me some antibiotics i'll take that for few days but um really don't want to go to cvs and pick they up because i'm lazy but two things that need to do tomorrow before class is one need to print out my draft and then do pre-game things for [redacted] and god [redacted] is gonna kill me i'm i'm still kind of like sad about my grade have right now but still i've want tr i'm going to try really hard to get some even if they so hard but just because today was sick didn't have like ou had very little energy like almost no energy probabl think for like homework the only things did was write page for my essay and um what was that things called and then read like 20 page um so that wasn't great but they okay um but did read 20 page in 30 minutes which is good timing for me feel like 10 page in 15 minutes that that pretty good i'm getting faster but then um so we had like the ex [inaudible] today where my essay was um like deconstructed and was really worried but they turns out that lot of people like really liked my essay and that there is few things should do to just kinda clear they up and they feel like there isn't something like but there wasn't like blaring issues or things that like really had people confused like like think was clear in the sense that they understood but they just thought that could fix some things to just make they better like there was one one things where somebody basically says said add this and take this out which was nice but we'll see how my preceptor talks to me tomorrow hopefully they won't be jerk and just like explain how much they hates my stuff 'cause like now know that people actually liked they so we'll see but they some asshole so don't care um hung out with my friends more today which was very nice that got to see them and two of them came with me to urgent care um yeah guess that they i'm just tired have no motivation or energy to do anything today so um today i'm feeling ve-very sick also um had fever today so went to my first class at 1100 but then didn't go to my class at 100 and instead took fever nap and then had to wake up and go to draft meeting with my expos preceptor and was like i'm not about to have to just like try to even argue with him or even try to like sit don't know like got in there and he was just like going off and well he wasn't going off he was just saying like what need to change and what i've been doing wrong and so was just like uh-huh yup yup would write few things down but wasn't really engaging and think he definitely noticed that probably had it with the way that he have been talking to me so we'll see how he responds to me in the future um and if he ever like confronts me or anything which would be very obnoxious then would say to him just woke up from fever nap so was still not receptive and my brain wasn't really working considering have sinus infe-infection and had fever probably still did have fever when went um um the guy that like snapchatted me earlier didn't responds though was going to but then forgot so it works out um and what else nah think just like being sick oh was like having really bad morning just like getting all of his comments back my expos comments back just like basically saying that the essay is bad despite what everybody else had to say in class and and oh what really irritated me he was like yeah well these comments they're just suggestions then like his comments was like you didn't argue these well and like so that that was his main like the majority of his comments he just saying that had bad argument which thought and which all the other students thought wasn't that bad hmm but it is okay because i'm tired and i'm going to sleep and don't have to deal with him until monday so hopefully he won't be an asshole and actually part of me just like prays that he will be an asshole to me but he'll do it in front of everybody else so then i'll have like witnesses and proof that these things is happening maybe i'll just start like recording every every class so today is weird like right now i'm just about to go meet up with guy to hook up with so he on his way and forgot that should probably do this before he comes 'cause it'd be weird if was just talking to nobody i'd have to tell him this whole thing and that whole long story anyways okay so hmm it probably only hell of day this weekend however only had four thing to do finish my pizza which did read 75 pages which did um read an essay which i've not done um watch the lecture notes for last thursday 'cause missed it which i've not done and then um edit my paper which i'll i'll maybe do that this weekend but so that like mainly what did got my phone dropped off so that good that i'm like getting thing done but don't know today was just feeling like really lonely and stuff just left out um with just being like invited to parties and all that stuff so that was probably that was really actually didn't like see that many people do that many thing got bunch of free stuff from an activities further which was nice so i'm at home right now in bed it 300 am um i'm little sad 'cause claudio is not here and i'm just lonely sleeping but it all right like it not that big deal but mean that makes me realize like claudio which knew did but you know do um and also realized that have to read whole book tomorrow so i'm uh have to get on that and also do the that lecture video thing which will not be fun um alex also invited me to go spin class tomorrow and said yes however forgot that am basically coughing every single minute so probably do not have the lung capacity to go and do some cardio intense workout like that so might have to text him in the morning and be like yo don't think i'm gonna be able to do this but um positive happened today okay well last night there was guy who came over and we had sex and it was very fun and nice and he really cool guy and we'll probably meet up again he said he wants to take me out to dinner so said all right and then um today we went to the nigerian gala thing and that was so much fun and there was this other guy that met who is in my grade and started making out with him too 'cause was just feeling confident and then so that probably happened at 1230-ish and then he just brought me back to my dorm so what [inaudible] so nice um but yeah so uh dunno guy am weird today has been all right didn't really do much um woke up kind like 1030 just laid in bed and then went and bought my book that had to read for class tomorrow and went to brunch with my friends and was still coughing and feeling sick so like nothing was really enjoyable should has gotten waffle but didn't so next week i'll i'll get one of that um but then finished reading that book in an hour and half which was great 'cause it 80 pages long and so that means that was like reading it fast and think did it think like know remember things from it but it was just like such hard book that she was like you're not gonna understand this in the first go and you or the second or third go so read it and then we'll talk about it in class and then hopefully you'll figure things out so um did that and then also watched that lecture video and also edited my paper little bit so wrote completely new first paragraph and then like edited the second and third paragraph so that it speaks more to what changed my essay to so i'm focusing in it even more am taking out all of the things that he doesn't want including just like little tiny things that he said is just making he was like so basically what i'm doing in it is am using the author as he talk about himself as an example and then so he like oh well you doesn't wanna use too much of of 'he writes himself as' because then you're getting like too an he like then you start getting too abstract because then you start talking about what he is doing and then what he is like that makes no sense why you am saying that but i'm like all right so just say the essay describes him as or he is described in the essay as and so it just makes the verbiage not as good but doesn't care because i'm just gonna do what he say because he just an asshole and um and then uh the guy from last night texted uh me so we've been talking um which has been nice and saw the guy that had crush on before and he like talking to me still so means he probably just want to be friends guess still want to be friends he invited me to go to spin class but said no because am sick and do not has the lung capacity for spin class at this present moment um but i'll probably go with him next week my day was relatively good today um was still like coughing all day which wasn't the best but have had more energy today and could focus more so went to class um went to class today my queer cannon class and that was good we was reading book but it was very confusing and i'm still confused but less confused it just really hard and then um boo boo boo what else um then expos talk like twice which is all need to do and um 'cause hate that class but then um between 1200 and 300 finished rewriting my expos paper so that good and now i'm just gonna like go through it little bit every day to try to edit it and i'll like read it out loud tomorrow do some edit and then like wednesday i'll do the thing where read each sentence from like the end of the essay upward so read the sentence backwards to just try to hear like what the sentence is actually saying and making sure that it all makes sense and um what else and then did good amount of reading today so tomorrow actually don't have that much probably have like don't know how many pages that is 10 pages of poetry that still need to read maybe little bit more than 10 pages um but yeah maybe nah actually have no idea but maybe about 30 minutes of poetry reading that probably um and then have to read two chapters from one book so then that really is not that much so can i'm actually planning on doing that in the morning so then can go to class at 100 and then go to orchestra at 400 but still need need need need need need to call the fdo so that can get access to one of the practice rooms to the freshman dorm practice rooms because need to practice my bass and once do that i'll probably try to practice like thursday night or something don't don't care when um now just need to print stuff out for ls1a but that it um but highlight of my day the guy that made out with on saturday night um who was texting lot yesterday told his friend that he like is really happy that we're talking and he thinks that i'm really attractive so that made me feel good um oh we also went on field trip to mount auburn cemetery and that was really pretty but then low point for the day was um don't know just expos feeling like rewrote this paper but then still feel like it not very good and when read it just don't it it just the subject matter that don't like so then the essay don't like so um today was fine um what is it today tuesday um was actually relatively productive for tuesday got everything needed to get done for tomorrow relatively early um the only thing that had to do after dinner and after rehearsal was read my prelab which took like 20 minutes and the lab is gonna be so fun so i'm actually really excited um so that good and um and i'm excited to work with my lab partner again 'cause he cool hopefully he'll work with me um hopefully he doesn't think i'm crazy person and if we do work together i'm gonna try to get his number i'm gonna be like yo we you should text me sometimes so that we have so we can just study together because doesn't know what i'm doing in this class ever and need study help and need study tips um and then have my job interview tomorrow so just did like little bit of um prep of what i'm kinda interested if it like ask me why do you wanna do this and what do you [inaudible] here and then i'll be like um just talk all healthy 'cause that way won't just seem like dumbass coming in there knowing nothing um but hanging out with friends seeing friends well didn't talk to my friends as much lately i've been back on the not needing person 247 crying like usually the only time when actually want someone to be with me is when i'm eating which is weird that doesn't have to be like with somebody all the time or when see my friends doing something doesn't have to be with them but think tomorrow after um after dinner i'll probably try to do some work with them hang out um do some editing on my paper since that probably oh and then my um pre-game for ls1a 'cause that that is gonna be the only thing have to do so it shouldn't be it shouldn't be too bad um yeah negative negative um doesn't understand anything that going on in ls1a like i'm very very confused and it very hard and like it not good because feel i'm th say to myself that i'm not confused and then go do like practice problems and doesn't know what going on so think i'm just gonna try to go through and read the textbook read couple chapters and see if that will help elucidate thing so today has been um like bad day bad day um was just feeling down because of like my writing got some comments back from my [redacted] professor at or uh um df and he had like just feel like my with that it wasn't such as like my argument was bad he said he liked the argument and evidence was fine it was just like would give too many like gener not generalizations but just like would say something and then wouldn't like actually has it backed up which that makes sense but there was only few instances of that feel like and but just like re-reading it is just not like good sounding essay which just makes me feel bad like about myself like can read it and tell that it it doesn't sound that great and um like doesn't know what going on and also i'm just feel like dumbass and i'm really worried about this mid-term because need to study but doesn't i'm doesn't know how so i'm gonna text some friends and be like yeah we need to study together this weekend um so was just feeling like really really bad earlier but then my lab partner gave me his number today so that made me feel good oh also had my job interview and feel like that went terribly oh so doesn't know just feel just feel like crap feel like crap today but got my [inaudible] job finished and went to the writing center and that was probably the best thing for me to do um so think i'm just gonna try to do that with all of my essay but i'm really worried like once work if if work starts like won't has enough time to be doing all of the work need to do like just because realize during the day is when is when do lot of my my work that like when i'm most productive yeah but mean that just mean in the evenings has to be really productive which is gonna be hard that gonna be hard for me to do so today was not the best day um don't know just had um don't know so hooked up with guy today brought him over here except had meeting to go to in 30 minutes so it was like really fast and we was both really horny and so i'm starting to just uh get back on my old shit of just being impulsive just out of control because can because feel like everything else in my life is spiraling out of control so that why do that but deleted my grindr and tinder apps so hopefully i'll get better with that like i'm forcing myself to not invite guy over especially with that but don't know just got freaked out and especially 'cause he like had blood he was bleeding and then so that made me that scared me mean he clean so hmm but still just seeing it was freaky considering it that never happened to me before and like it was just gross thing that i'd done like i'm i'm gro i'm disgusted by myself for doing that when know shouldn't have and um went to huhs and am allergic to my antibiotic so then now they're putting me on cortisone and they're putting me on prednisone and um some other stuff and benadryl um to help get rid of like the rash like make sure it stays away um and then also went to go for meeting for my expos not my expos my [inaudible] or my english class and so um basically basically still can't write but it getting better like just need to change the intro write new conclusion fix up some stuff [laughter] in the in the structure but other than that have good good argument and somewhat good analysis and evidence hmm but don't know ugh okay [one high for the] day oh bought my phone case so it should be here on saturday and that guy from yesterday venmoed me 10 just for fun so it was pretty sweet so today has been um it been all right woke up then did some reading finished two reading which was really good and started doing my che-cheat studying thing for [inaudible] so um i'm i'm getting theirs and then has like 180 pages left to read of book by wednesday then 120 pages of book that has to read by next monday so i'm feeling good not feeling too stressed out but i've got my job so then start on tuesday and i'm little stressed out about that because just like starting new thing i'm not gonna know how to do anything and also it just like lot of work time like 12 hours plus basically i'm doing something 900 to 500 every single day um and or actually more 1000 to 500 every single day but still it hard it'll be hard doing like seven hours of stuff week and then still has to do my reading and my homework so we'll has to figure out how that goes um but then went out partying with um guy that made out with last saturday think it was and it was like really fun then we got to hang out with all of theirs friends and like goes around and party-hop even though the parties weren't fun but it was fun to goes like hang out with all of theirs friends and stuff so yeah and he gave me good good-night kiss when he walked me up to my room again so that was really really nice so other than just like little bit of stress from from starting work today has been all right today has been relatively good day my best friend from home who goes to [redacted] um just arrived today and visited so we hang out lot tonight it was really fun and it was fun to meet his friend so then tomorrow think he gonna come and meet all of my friend but then other than that today has just kind of been boring day where i've just been doing homework finished editing my paper and finished doing some dumb thing for expos started reading but all of this like paper [editing] stuff has just made me realize that um am not good at writing which is not fun feel like i'm just not good at anything mean also okay so just smoked some weed until now i'm like whenever do smoke it just makes me feel bad about myself 'cause start overthinking thing and really at this point just feel like i'm not smart like it not that feel like don't deserve that should be here or feel like yeah but just feel like got here and deserve to get here but then just don't fit in because can't like do anything right like i'm not and really need practice base really do it so hard though to figure that shit out today has been um uh it been weird day so really haven't done much just did some homework and got my ls 1a stuff done which is good got halfway done through my reading basically so don't has lot to do tomorrow but still should like use it up mean study and stuff and hung out with um the guy that like the one that um went out with on friday and then like whenever that was two saturdays ago so um we're hanging out more now and he really cute and nice but i'm just kinda stressing out because don't know like what want [and see] feel like do want relationship but then also at the same time feel like i'm crazy person and rushing into things and i'm like like speeding things up in my mind when they're not actually there and also i'm just like self-sabotaging so keep saying that wanna like talk to other person but just don't know it just all stressful and my lab partner texted him on like friday was like yo wanna meet up to check my set answers he haven't texted me back he said saw him last night he was like i'll i'll text you tomorrow he didn't saw him walking [inaudible] just said hey but didn't ask about it 'cause i'm not crazy person but still whatever mad i'm mad so today has probably one been one of my most productive days i've been here read like 160 pages worked on my essay studied for my midterm i'm feeling really well i'm not feeling like really good i'm feeling like pretty solid with the midterm if had like little bit of extra time that would be nice but i'm not gonna like overexert myself think maybe what i'll do is before like that hour lunch period that has probably just like go over psats or something or like the little um work packets that we had with my friend i'll probably go over them before and then we'll walk to class together at lunch but the only thing that i'm like little worried about is just my first days of work tomorrow i'm just stressed don't really know what gonna go on everyone there is gonna be like an upperclassman they all know what they're doing and then i'm just baby and don't know how to do anything um yeah so today was really productive and also went shopping and got an nice clothes because there was 40 off thing at urban outfitters and also there was sale going so was like you know i'm gonna get all this stuff so got jacket and shirt they would has been like 180 and got they for 40 so that sweet which is amazing um but but but but but but but but but but um the the um oh also the guy that like they came over that hung out with yesterday they came over again so we was doing work and stuff then took them out to go get an smoothies and so they just like really nice and was talking with my friend and they was like they was really awkward but also they like endearing and so am so they kind of like nice to be with somebody who also awkward and they bought me tickets to go see the ted talk so that was like they like starting to be thing where we're like starting to date which is i'm kind of liking they they fun they new they new thing trying not to stress myself out about they and like with dealing with other guy there one other person who there is two other person who um hang out with me one i'm gonna be just like yo we just gotta be friend and then another one don't know what i'll do with them think they wants to go out to dinner so i'll probably just do that because mean the thing with me and this guy right now is that we don't really like we're not like exclusive or anything this has we've only known each other for like two weeks so they okay feel like if go out to dinner with one guy but they not like i'm gonna like has sex with them or anything so they not like we're flirting either so don't feel as bad mean like that still am little conflicted at this point so i'll figure they out when they happens but until then i'm trying not to stress myself out today kinda sucked um it was my first day of work and got in there and my boss is like can't tell if she like me or not because feel like kind of unqualified basically just because my advisor got me the job and feel like sh can tell in her look that she doesn't really like she not as enthusiastic about me working there as other people is like there some other people that came in and she was like hey so excited to see you but then with me she was just like regular professionalism which mean guess is good but then also like doesn't make me feel good that she like other people more than me um and also it just gonna be difficult 'cause there so much that have to learn but think it'll be good difficult the only bad thing about that job is that have to work 12 hours week which sucks so like today was on my was like doing stuff nonstop went from work 900 to 1200 had lunch 1200 to 100 midterm 1200 to 200 'cause came out early and think with the midterm [it went all right] there wasn't anything where was like oh my god got that wrong know or oh my god didn't know what was going on at all with this question like with th all of her had some idea so it was just as long as got the right concepts then thing would be all right um and what else oh and then after that after 200 walked over to the freshman dean office so that could finally get access to the uh freshman practice rooms and then so 315 to three forty 350 was in the practice rooms and then 400 to 630 was at rehearsal and then dinner and then like and then and then like went to go print stuff out then by the end at like 815 was at the writing center and then didn't get out of the writing didn't get back home from the writing center till 900 just 'cause had to wait and got good feedback but then got my [blue sky] done and then edited my paper ton so i'll go over it again tomorrow and read it but mean at this point i'm not sure what else there is for me to do by myself but actually the writing center is like the greatest thing ever and i'm gonna go to that every single time have paper due but doesn't know just have been feeling kind of sad during the day and know this was mix of like work and midterm and just like doing stuff nonstop but just today doesn't feel like even though was really productive it just wasn't like rewarding it didn't feel rewarding so didn't get to like hang out with see my friends at all it kinda made me little sad today had its ups and downs its was kind of like sucky during the beginning of the day just with like having to do work all the time and not having any free time and i'm just tired and hate school was thinking to myself like this morning actually regret going here and its just because feel like don't have that much fun or that much time and just like lot of things i'm dealing with just like figuring out what want here and like my expectations and trying to find good friends and yeah know have good friends but also like called to get better viewpoint and and actually really can't get one because of my terrible schedule so that is extremely extremely frustrating so i'll have to figure out what i'm gonna do might have to go and use like some other private person that not um through [redacted] [because mean now it] won't be that bad but then need to um but also for good things went out to um ice cream with my friends with the guy that like and his friends for um friends birthday this was really fun and yeah i'm starting to like him don't really know how he'd feel about its because mean do like him but don't want to rush into things and i'm fairly prone to rushing into things so i'll just have to like talk to my friends and stuff about that figure out what i'm gonna do how i'm gonna deal with its 'cause i've yeah how i'm gonna deal with its life kinda sucks right now with just just with school and work having to work and it was like little bit better um one of the other um like full-time people was it was helping me which is good mean guess should be it good that i'm being trained but i've but like the other people feel like it got it didn't need the training that needed so that just like another reason why and don't know feel still feel like my supervisor don't like me which is don't make me feel good but just need to figure out how to stop worrying about people not liking me 'cause it sucks and i'm also getting stressed about relationships don't know how to do anything turned in an essay it probably terrible and [xball] sucks there you have it today i'm just tired and don't wanna do school all yeah just not it hasn't been the best day really hasn't been the best week am currently sitting on the floor of my bathroom crying today has been very strange day woke up and went to work and work sucked up until the last little bit because got like the inbox cleared so didn't has anything like new and stressful that had to work on and like my director was out of the office so was not under scrutiny and then the rest of the day was sort of good guess got my eyebrows done and finished some my pset and my post-lab but and then went out to dinner with the guy from tufts he came back here we like watched tv and made out but wanted to hang out with the other guy that like who is freshman here but he was hanging out with his friend from [redacted] and for some reason was just like going crazy and just like assumed that he didn't like me because he didn't wanna hang out with me tonight which need to not do need to figure out how to calm down and then was just with my friend and we was talking about like just life life kind of sucks for all of me just with school and not being happy here and like not knowing who we am and just like being unhappy with who we've become and 'cause at this point really am just not happy and don't has time to be happy and so today was had some good and some bad times um good slept until noon which was great and then went to the tedx guy that liked and it was like was kinda stressed out during it but also it was like trying to tell myself to have fun but then was still like bummed from just like everything that was going on from yesterday and then afterwards went to dinner with my friend at [redacted] and was just like feeling lonely well not lonely just like feeling separated from everybody else and just sad so then when we came back like cried little bit more and we was just kind of talking about just like friend and again the same thing of how like i'm not really happy here and um just don't have enough times and i'm not doing anything that like and also somethings about just like friend and me feeling left out and like as some afterthought and that just like me overthinking thing 'cause know my friend don't aren't thinking that like 100 know that it just like that how thing like feel for me sometimes which is not good think good is we went to um this one party well also the other negative was that um the guy that like his friend from [redacted] [redacted] yeah his friend from [redacted] was visiting and this guy like really attractive and he was also gay so it was like was feeling uh not unworthy but like whatever that would be like not as as like attractive or as good as him and um but then so that friend was at the pre-game with me and he was there too and went with came with my other friend but it was like fun and nice and then we all went to the party together and then met up found the guy that the guy that liked and so we started dancing together and it was fun and then after while his other friend came back and really was dancing on him like was grinding hardcore even though that the the guy like and even made out like we kissed at the dance so then was like whoa what going on here um and then kind of like scooted away and danced with my other friend but then after like minute or actually probably yeah maybe minute or two he came back and was like i'm so sorry about that he just came onto me and wouldn't like leave and was like that all right but then we ended up him and ended up like leaving and going back and meeting up my other friend and then we like ate pizza and we went back to his place and we like made out little bit and then he walked me back here and so and he also had told his friend um basically it long story basically he had like told his friend about me and so it all was it like knew who was and and all that stuff so feeling little bit better about him today was relatively uneventful day woke up went to brunch with my friends which was nice and then went to the harvard black scientist um lunching thing and um black scientist they're all like socially awkward nerds so it was very hard to talk to people um but hung out with my my big [inaudible] there [inaudible] really cool so there was that um probably the best positive of today was got my [inaudible] paper grade back and got an minus so that made me feel good and then also finished read the whole 260 pages that needed to read this past week in one night so that was great too um and don't know just negatives or the negatives haven't been as bad as it was earlier in the week but it just kind of like still feeling bad about myself and just like inadequate like physically too just feeling like don't [inaudible] attractive uh and also just kind of like being lost and not knowing really what want at this point and also being socially awkward so don't know how to deal with the guy i'm uh the guy i'm interested in but he also socially awkward so it like kind of cute if that works out today was um okay had to go to [new work] today though it sucked and it really was stressed me out and i'm just back onto that idea that really can't do work so it really good that i'm not doing it like worked till 300 and had class at 300 so was almost late to my class like got in right when we was starting so it was just nerve-racking and frustrating and know that couldn't be able to do that for whole semester and [then] like whole year and um the positives [redacted] came over and we did homework together he bought me candy which was really nice um but didn't see my friends much today it was really just [inaudible] in class and uh work was like doing stuff 1000 to 500 and then just like uh homework can stress me out and just like being sad all day it sucks so today wasn't the best day got my ls 1a midterm back and my grade was not good so came home afterwards and cried and took nap so that really wasn't fun but did go into work and talked to my supervisor and she was actually like really caring she was like want you to like take care of yourself and all that stuff but you did seem like you was really interested in the job interview so she was like so what we can do is have you work like four hours week so i'm going to do that i'm gonna work work tuesday mornings and thursday afternoons just so that can like have little bit of extra money and then also the job experience is good guess and it kind of nice to have clear something to like clear my mind with the only like stressful thing will be talking on the phone and after while i'll just have to get the hang of that and then think just feel like alone guess when i'm doing it that it like hate asking for help because it seem like everybody else is doing their own thing and i'm just bugging them constantly um and yeah feel like my midterm is just and work but i'm feeling better about work now that like my mondays and my fridays is clear because mondays was stressful and fridays was also very stressful so hopefully hopefully everything will work out and then that way i'll be like i'll still have time on mondays between between [xbas] and my seminar and then tuesday i'll have time between um whatever between like i'll have solid two hours between work and ls 1a and then another two hours between ls 1a and orchestra which is good and then and then thursday is like sort of full day but not like too bad haven't get to sleep in and then [inaudible] and then fridays completely empty again that what need just need an empty fridays today was relatively boring day didn't do much just went to like school and guess things are just like less stressful now that got work figured out so that good so i'm working two hours on tuesday mornings two hours on friday mornings and it gonna be easy 'cause not many other people are gonna be there so that just have time to quietly work by myself which are very nice also it in the mornings so people aren't calling which are great and um what else good the mean there some good like hung out with guy with like the guy i'm sort of dating guess and but he sick so um that was kind of bummer wrote some of my draft for my [inaudible] paper that due tomorrow that really not good so whatever mean it not due tomorrow it due friday so i'm gonna try and finish it tomorrow um and i'm just still feeling bad about [inaudible] [a] so really need to figure out what i'm gonna do for that like don't know what it are 'cause work hard and can't do well on the [inaudible] and stuff um wish there was some easy answer to that so today hasn't been that bad of day was actually pretty productive finished my pset and my um whatever that thing is called my the draft of my essay and did it in like relatively quick amount of time so um i'm like actually feeling okay about it and then i'm gonna go to that thing where get to check over my answers with some of the other students to make sure that my stuff is all right for my pset so that the only thing this week and then have to do is just read to read like good amount but it not actually that bad so i'll start on that maybe tomorrow 'cause don't think wanna do anything don't wanna do any work on saturday um but watched it with guy that like and bunch of his friends so that was probably the best thing that happened today um it really late though so have to work and wake up early tomorrow to work but lately still kind of have been feeling like dissatisfied with myself just like my opinions in general but then also today was like so many people is doing so many thing and they're just so emotionally stable and i'm doing like one and half thing besides school and i'm dying like orchestra which is only two and half hours week and then working which is only four hours week and have like other people who is doing 20 hours of stuff week i'm like how [i dunno] how people have time to do that do work and school and still have time to have fun so like and then also still get good grades but can't don't know what going on and feel like need to have some sort of lifestyle change but don't know what it is so today was actually today was relatively okay day work was um it wasn't that bad it was actually pretty good just 'cause nobody else was in the office so was able to work by myself um which was just really nice like didn't have to worry about other people watching over me and stuff and got all of my work done and nobody happened to call so that good um and then got my essay done did little bit of reading so just need to do like all my reading this weekend and um i'm bit bummed though 'cause was supposed to hang out with guy that like i'm just going to call him [redacted] for now um and didn't hang out with him tonight even though we was like kind of planning on doing it which have kind of made me like little sad it like not super sad but like last weekend he wanted me to spend the night and kind of wanted to to do that again like do that this weekend but i'm just like not sure of the time guess don't know still overthink things too much with him like sometimes think he like me lot and then other time i'm like he doe he don't like me at all it weird [inaudible] and weird so today was relatively good day didn't do much went to goodwill with my friends and woke up kinda late which was nice started reading my play that have to read and i'm almost done so should easily be able to finish tomorrow morning which is good um and then went out to dinner with [redacted] and we had good time and then he came over later and we like started watching movie but then we paused it and then we started making out and stuff we decided to have oral sex but then like he wanted to stop he said think we're going too fast and was like all right and was like totally open to it was like just want you to feel comfortable but then he was like feeling kinda sad and he was probably just embarrassed and felt kinda bad it wasn't like felt like pressured him or anything 'cause he was like how far do you wanna go and was like this is how far wanna go and he was like okay yeah me too but he just changed his mind which is totally okay just felt just like felt bad because uh just would like normally feel some sort of guilt just because uh don't know at that present moment was going further than he wanted even though like he said one thing at the beginning but then he changed his mind and then so that then that so yeah um yeah so feel like little bombed just that that happened 'cause if if we'd just stayed with making out then it would have happened so that-that what i'm saying is why i'm bombed 'cause just didn't want him to feel bad but eat spicy food and then had spicy poop which wasn't fun like i'm laying in bed and my stomach kinda hurts so uh i'm in pain right now don't want to feel like this today was kind of boring day didn't do much just did little bit of reading and studied for ls 1a which is good um need to call the doctor though so can reschedule my um therapy appointment because it gonna interfere with my whatever that thing is called um concert but i'm little bummed because gave and like told my friends when it have to about the concert and stuff and how it have to get tickets but none of them have gotten tickets so that do not make me feel great um yeah so i'm not super excited about that and lately i've just kind of been overthinking thing with [redacted] 'cause feel like he like me but then also sometimes it weird 'cause then feel like i'm bothering them with just talking to them and don't know and he like wa-was in [redacted] today and he was eating by himself but then he saw me and waved to them and he waved back but he went and he sat by himself instead of coming over so was like what what what going on with that hmm so don't know but today was just kind of like lazy day not much really happened today it was an all-right day kind of my emotions was um low with everything wasn't like too happy but wasn't too sad with anything still am like now i'm starting to get worried just like overthinking things with guy that like and i'm not really sure if he like me as much as like him and then then get all stressed out but just really need to sit down and have conversation with him on what we wanna do but just get nervous and don't know what he gonna say and yeah but just really need to do it and also i'm like why don't he start that conversation but then also it still is really early like it only been little more than three weeks that this have been going on so maybe after like month sometime in november i'll talk to him maybe after my birthday 'cause then it would have been like well over month yeah and then feel like that good time so lately i've been um really stressing out the guy that like because then go through periods of where think that he doesn't like me and it just because like sometimes he'll go into the dining hall and i'll be there and he'll see me and he'll wave and stuff but then he go and he sits by himself it not like he going to sits with his other friends he just like see me and then do chooses to not sits with me when he has the option to rather than just sitting by himself that makes me feel bad and then that also like happened today this morning when was going to breakfast and saw him leaving like he wou he was leaving the dish place while was putting my my tray away he said hey and said hey but then he just like kept walking so he was like 20 feet in front of me for the whole walk and was like whoa why didn't you wanna come walk with me and then he like he doesn't know if i'm just like if this is all in my head but it still stressing me out and doesn't know what to do because part of me wants to talk to him and be like yeah what going is this just you or is you pulling back what is you thinking about like my relationship but then i'm not sure if it like too early on to has that conversation think i'll probably go through this week and like this weekend and then see what going on instead of waiting any longer 'cause it just getting too stressful but um went to my english professor office hours and we talked through lot of theory stuff so i'm understanding more of it now which is good and sort of has an idea of what i'm gonna write about for this essay which is also good so now i'm not feeling completely lost so my day today has been very very weird like it been on and off with being stressful and not stressful and like happy and sad so um wednesdays are just always kind of busy for me so that not really that good but got my comments back from my expos preceptor about my essay and he didn't has that many like major things to say and we had my meeting today so actually like figured out exactly what needed to do and just finished doing it so it feels like just finished editing my paper which are really good however are little tipsy because went to wine wednesdays thingy so think it good but hmm we'll see tomorrow morning anyways so then also texted the guy that like and i'm like yo you've been kind of distant i've been seeing that you've been like eating by yourself and it seems like it on purpose i'm just checking in to make sure that everything okay and he was like yeah that sweet of you to ask and he was just like i've just been wanting to get some alone time just like reset and i'm like okay but that cool so then i'm like reassured about that however also went out to dinner with the other guy that haven't hung out with in while but he goes to [redacted] and like we hooked up before but texted him bef like later after the stuff with this with the guy that like that been going on and was like yo just wanna be friends are that all good and he was like yeah but like had really good time and kind of still like him so don't know what should do with this situation really don't know really don't know what to do feels like should drop the guy from [redacted] but the things are are that with the guy from [redacted] are that he always like whenever want something he always there to come and like hang out with me and he always like don't know just seeming to to pr no it like he know that i'm not his top priority but when he talking to me it make me feels like are his top priority whereas with the guy who goes here it not really the same so just don't know what to think about that and then just has that other two essay two movies to read book to read and four theory readings to do and um i've one other things set and post-lab that need to do so i'm not going to be having good weekend this week so that will not be good but i'm gonna try to get like lot of it done tomorrow today has been very long day just with like waking up and editing my paper and going to class and then coming back and then took my [ice] but i'm so happy because got 13 out of 13 on the multiple choice which was good so now i've just gotta wait and see what get for the for the short answer ones so that worth 12 points total so i'm hoping don't fail things like did at the [inaudible] whatever we'll honestly just has to see and um what else wrote whole paper so finished editing that other ones so has two of them done well basically two still need another ones and watched movie today for class but other than that the day hasn't been that good or bad it was just normal today has been kind of weird day um work was stressful 'cause just had to do lot of stuff that was due like the day before because people in my office like to not do work their work and read 50 pages of my book and did like an outline and and draft of the first paragraph of my essay four of my last of three essay draft so hopefully i'll be able to get that draft done tomorrow 'cause has so much other stuff that has to do so tomorrow i'm really gonna has to work hard today really didn't do anything after like 630 'cause went to like an orchestra thing and then we went to like orchestra dinner thing but lately i've been feeling like the guy that like doesn't like me as much as like him or at least he doesn't like treat me that way 'cause like just i'm always the one who asks him to do stuff and who always like texting him first and just it doesn't make me feel good and doesn't wanna know really what wanna do about the situation but then also any circumstance whenever like like the guy it never been the way that want him to so doesn't know if that just like an unachievable thing for me but it really do suck today has been pretty shitty day got so last night um went to go hook up with the guy from [redacted] so not the guy that like here and that was because i'm starting to don't know if i'm convincing myself that the guy here that like don't like me but no matter what it is is he not giving me the attention that want so it really isn't making me feel good like at all makes me feel like shit honestly but then feel bad for going and hooking up with other people just because like don't know what he thinking so think tomorrow i'm gonna talk to him and be like yo what up because really don't know what going on and if you do want relationship then in order for it to work for me we're gonna has to change some things and yeah then was doing work all day and has so much more to do all my friends went out and didn't and was texting the guy that like here and about like making plans to go out tonight basically he just ditched me he was like ditching me but well he was actively ditching me while he was texting me like not even making plans just like sort of avoiding like telling me what going on but avoiding like some acc like av-avoiding inviting me basically and then that just makes me feel like all of my friends is just going out and like has to invite myself to everything god things is just too much with people hate having to deal with people so today kinda sucked because um just woke up really sad from not being able to hang out with all my friends and from missing out on like halloween parties and stuff 'cause feel like that just like classic college-kid thing to go to that parties but didn't make it because was crying in bed so then cried little bit more when woke up but got lot of work done so got my blue sky proposal done edited paper watched two movies finished my book and am almost done with my draft for my last essay so the only thing left on my like checklist so far is to finish the essay then do my post-lab which is due on wednesday so i'm feeling good about that but um then went and talked to the guy that like here and he doesn't like me anymore so that doesn't feel good to be rejected but then also at the same time was kinda feeling like didn't really wanna date but then doesn't feel good to have somebody say that like it just doesn't like you and so 'cause still liked him so it just kind of bummer but whatever it over just feel kind of shitty in general mean what new so today was um it was actually like pretty good day told myself that was gonna be productive so finished editing my go my seminar paper finished went to the um writing center and edited my [expos] paper and then did my own edits to my qc paper so hopefully these things will get done relatively soon and don't know i've kind of just it was sunny out for some part of the day which is really nice and wasn't trying to worry about like boys or friends that much just went to lunch by myself and happened to find people so that was nice and was just kind of like living and it worked almost fell asleep in my seminar though was like nodding off which is kind of funny um finished my post-lab so today was fine i'm talking now to the guy from tufts more and like part of me feels weird because i'm sort of getting out of pesudo-relationship and i'm immediately going to something else which know that that is not really particularly healthy well maybe it not that it not it probably not healthy in the sense that like need to be interested in somebody but mean guess it healthy mean like not not healthy in the sense that just like have these other people that sort of was talking to in the past so that now i'm doing it more but whatever i'll let things play out but he does take forever to respond to me so that frustrating hate it when people take forever to text me back my day today was pretty uneventful didn't do much went to work actually work was kind of stressful because had to talk to people twice on the phone and hate doing that but it also kind of funny because said you know said to myself it actually not that bad working in the morning because nobody calls and then got calls and was like damn that sucks and then got another calls um but work is okay i'm starting to figure things out um yup um but watched some netflix today so that was nice that gave myself break and had oh also went to this one event things where got free churros and bubble tea which that was so fun it was so great and then went to rehearsal for orchestra and actually now i'm like really really looking forward to rehearsal like it getting to be point where it really fun to go which i'm really happy about um except we got music two actually might have been three two two or three songs that we have not yet played and it is going to be performed on at the concert on friday so i'm gonna have to actually go practice that so need to uh that my plan tomorrow to go practice and then also to go to like hm or someplace so that can get black button-up shirt because need one for the concert um yeah and all my essays is done it just need to be like finalized guess just go over one more time each to make sure that they're good [inaudible] the writing center for my qc one but that it so i'm not feeling too stressed and got another 25 out of 25 on my [ice] so i'm super happy about that so today was kinda sucky day um had like my normal classes and they was just kind of boring boring and feel dumb in my english classes um but submitted my expos paper and my seminar paper today and then went to the writing center and basically have to rewrite my entire essay so that is putting damper on my weekend and but good news is that got an extension until monday so have lot of time to do they which is very nice but that means this whole weekend i'm just gonna be working on they which really really sucks and at this point i'm like so confused about just the topic that don't know even if i'll be able to write good essay but we'll see and what else oh had rehearsal today that went pretty well except i'm sad that couldn't be back earlier and then still had to do little bit of homework and stuff but now i'm in bed have to wake up at 730 though to go poster for the concert for friday uh feel like all of the days now are just kind of sucking just because have to write this dumbass essay hate having to do all this work it just sucks and then don't have any time to do anything fun and like was don't even know what did today but was the most unproductive person ever it was so bad got basically nothing done um well got two readings done and an outline for my draft done oh no actually that lie got four readings done because did two in the morning but still so have to finish that draft finish the book do my pset um and then read an other stuff and then do something for expos hmm hate this like don't want the semester to be over 'cause don't want to wish my time away here but then also like want this semester to be over like want this classes to be over like the only one that actually like are uh so hard i'm so confused and i'm writing the outline for this essay and it might just be equally as terrible as the last one so we'll see how it goes hopefully it won't be that bad and also i'm just kind of like i'm lonely feel like my friends aren't hanging out with me as much and yeah and the guy from [redacted] we like didn't really have an argu well we sort of had like little bit of an argument he made me kinda feel bad but said that to him and then so he apologized but don't know can feel that can tell that he was not happy with how it ended even though he apologized but don't know kinda hate just hate things in general so today was it wasn't that bad it was just really busy just because had my orchestra concert but orchestra concert went pretty well and then went to the after-party with all of the people and it was really fun and i'm on my way back home right now um yeah men kinda suck this guy i'm going out on date with tomorrow we're going to museum but he kinda like being weird he just suck at texting which kinda suck so that like not that fun well it not but not but it just like it frustrating but don't know so i'll have to figure out really what going on really need to figure how to just be like chill and how to not uh just like guy and relationships in general i'm trying to figure out how to be in casual relationships but it cold and i'm walking back home just wanna get home so can go to bed and sleep in and then write my essay tomorrow but we're going to yes then i'm gonna go to the movie uh no no no no no no not the movie the museum we're going to the museum to [inaudible] i'm going to the museum yes um so negative it was just that was like but there um concert actually went really well but negative was that had to go to rehearsal like the whole day so that was annoying today was fine day just did lot of work but kinda woke up late was pretty productive think for the little amount of time that actually did work but ended up hooking up with guy tonight and it wasn't the guy from tufts that like am kind of going out on dates with and uh it feels just kinda like gross like really didn't need to do that and keep wondering why keep hooking up with guy and mean it definitely do it for like sense of control or something but like afterwards i'm like didn't really need that and it not that regret it it just like did actually like want it or was telling myself that did but it doesn't really matter 'cause went to party tonight and had bunch of fun with people from my entryway and still got good portion of my essay done only have two more paragraphs that need to write and oh and less than 100 pages of my book solved my pset but still can do it all by the due dates tomorrow today was good day got lot of stuff done got my set done got my essay finished and submitted and got my book finished um think like right now i'm feeling okay with my classes you know i'm kind of worried about this essay but i'm just gonna let whatever happen happen all i'm trying to get in that classes is if get then will be very happy but anyways so but went out to dinner with the guy from tufts and don't know it was weird because realized that i'm like so dependent on how other people like what guy think of me because was there and he was know that well this is just what i'm telling myself but he was like really kinda tired and out of it and think it just because he had long day but he didn't seem that happy to be there and that was it made me feel kind of like bummed that was excited to see him but he wasn't really that excited to see me it just that like like hanging out with people like that and want somebody to like me and feel like that just what get me down is when realize that somebody don't like me the way that want him to that what happened with the guy that had thing with before also need to stop just with men in general need to chill out and not like try to rebound or anything 'cause just need to take break men is just trash just hate him but need to find like way to make me happy 'cause don't know right now i'm just kinda living life just is unfortunate today was just was really tired today wasn't super productive got good amount of stuff done actually got lot of stuff done read 150 pages of of fun home which isn't due until next monday and then got some expos reading done and did my ls1a pregame the one thing though that really need to do sometime this week is read like read in full the chapters that haven't done yet so think that like four chapters so it'll be five on thursday so really need to get on that but don't know i'm really hungry right now need to go get myself some snacks and just like rearrange my life right now and like men just make me angry right now so the guy from [redacted] didn't text me today but you know it whatever i'm i'm allowed to be angry feel like hmm guy is dumb hate them wish didn't need them wish could like be happy on my own feel like tomorrow should try to meditate or do something don't know watched netflix today which was supposed to be like me time and yeah it was nice but it wasn't like wow i'm happy like need to figure out what can do that make me happy today wasn't terrible it was kind of like boring day didn't do much mean was sort of productive but uh no was fairly productive re-watched the documentary took some notes on it did response paper and then finished my book that wasn't even due until monday then after that just came home and did nothing and watched movie and then now i'm in bed it before 1100 so that'll be nice if that i'll be able to get like almost 10 hours of sleep wow that will be so nice and think the rest of the week i'm gonna start working hard on like my my research paper for [inaudible] so can get that stuff done and out of the way and then i'll have like ample time to work on my research thing for qc um so don't know nothing like great happened today but was kind of just like unhappy not that was sad in general like sad about something it was just that wasn't happy about anything which is kind of bummer and don't really know how to fix that um but have my lab tomorrow so get to see my lab partner it he kind of weird i'm not sure what he think about me but kind of wanna hang out with him and see like what he like um but it weird and need to stop like worrying too much about boys think i'll like let whatever happen happen but i'm not gonna put energy into anything at the moment feel like i'm starting to stress just gotta like let go that that what i'm gonna do today was relatively okay guess was productive did some homework but it wasn't like as much as wanted it to be and feel like just right now with my [inaudible] research in general just have so much stuff that just need to read through and figure out if need it or not 'cause right now i'm just kind of like sort of like skimming through things but not actually finding any like where i'm like uh that quote that really should use it like don't know it just just need to sift through things now like sit down and read everything [inaudible] have and then figure out what have wh and then what need from there so think tomorrow that what my focus should be and god really need to start studying for my mid-term that on tuesday and don't want to and hate mid-term uh so i'll have to stay for that and make like cheat sheet which won't be fun and yeah not fun at all nothing good will come from that so that will suck hopefully won't get shitty grade on that one um god i'm just stressing like today wasn't sad again it was just that wasn't happy and mean went out and did some fun things but feel like it all just temporary whenever go out and do something fun then later feel bad because didn't spend my time working and hate just like going to bed every single night thinking that could have done some other work or having more could still be done but mean that happens that it always gonna happens but think like once [inaudible] is over and that won't be as bad today has been um actually really productive day got ton of research stuff done and got my psat done and went to the library and met with the librarian and we found lot of good stuff got some books so now all i've read five articles that could possibly use has one more that need to read and then few chapters from some books and then other than that the day has been fine um don't has to go to work tomorrow which is really nice but i'm just kinda stressed out now lot because of my midterm which is not fun and i'm not happy that i'm gonna be stressed out for my birthday weekend and i'm going to the harvard-yale game and just got like my housing assignment thing but it with bunch of black guys and black men is usually not um accommodating to gay people so we'll see how that go also i'm the whitest black people know and it hard to interact with other black people and that just like whole nother sense-of-self-image problems that has but has so i'm thinking has one more articles could possibly read it now and then go to bed after that or go to bed now and then read it tomorrow feel like part of me should just say read now and then go to bed so can get it out of the way 'cause i'm gonna probably wake up at around the same time so just get that and then might as well sleep in for as long as want get up eat read i'm gonna or maybe should read my books right now maybe i'm gonna read some of [eleven] for like 45 minutes see if can zoom through that probably what i'm gonna do my god my face is so greasy feel like my fingers is just so dirty [feels just] dirty maybe i'll take shower okay so my day was like okay it wasn't even that long just did lot of work went started my day kinda late but got most of my research done and like got lot of reading done got solid like 120 pages of my book read so that good um so don't have like that much need to do tomorrow but went out tonight and now i'm really tired and this is also why i'm doing this very late and had good time and made out with some some guy and that was fun it made me feel good but you know i'm not even gonna try to focus on the the even think about the bad stuff i'm only gonna think about the good stuff yeah so hopefully tomorrow can be more productive but then it kind of bad was just really tired all day and i'm sure that that comes just with like every long day is like it just like really tired and um there was this guy that danced with and he was really trying to make out and didn't really want to and didn't and was like wow self-control and also making this boy practice how to be consensual and not force himself on people is good um but then my friend was feeling sad which made me kinda sad but not sad like as and he was bringing me down but was like damn wish could help him feel better that kinda sad but we had good talk so hopefully he'll feel better tomorrow so today well during the day it was well kinda fine it wasn't super productive got good amount of reading done but still need to do like solid 100 more pages that also need to study for [inaudible] would suck because have midterm soon but i'm not happy about that um but good news is is that went to dinner with some of my friends for my birthday dinner even though my birthday tomorrow which is still tec-technically today 'cause it past midnight so it is the 12th so yes happy birthday me but yeah went to this one party and it was really fun wanted to dance with this one guy but he didn't dance with me which made me sad but it okay guess i'm little sad but it doesn't really matter now i'm just really tired i'm kinda stressed about the midterm 'cause feel like i'm not going to do well at all which is not going to be good so we'll just see how everything goes so today was my birthday and it was very uneventful birthday think it just because like one had my birthday dinner last night so that was like my celebration with my friends and um then tonight like today everybody was so busy with homework that barely saw anybody went to [inaudible] with two of my friends and then just did homework by myself in the library and um and after lunch just stayed stayed in the library until went to dinner wow my day was really was uneventful but think it was just mix of like not seeing my friends and none of my presents from my parents had arrived yet [that] it didn't really feel like my birthday so was just kinda sad because nobody could like hang out or make today special but then my my friends came it surprised me it came like two-ish hours ago and it brought me cookie cake and some presents so that was really nice um and so i'm really happy about that and then face-timed my other friends from the [home] for long time and miss them i'm so excited to see them so that'll be good um and [i don't know] uh it was just kind of boring day got all my homework done but have my midterm on tuesday and i'm not excited about that like i'm really worried and really stressed out but uh [but] [inaudible] we'll see how it goes so today was um today was okay didn't really do much got my first present came and it was hydro flasks and was so happy about that now that have water bottle again can start drinking water and [inaudible] skin and got my [inaudible] done and finished reading all my [inaudible] sources um and got my research question or my sort of research question figured out um for the for my [inaudible] class so today was actually pretty productive um it was just and boring like nothing really happened was little sad it was kind of lonely and [redacted] are stressing me out like yeah it just stressful don't even know why it stressful it just like going traveling but have school work also realized that during thanksgiving break i'm probably gonna be lonely because nobody even gonna be on campus so i'll have to see which ones of my friends stay here don't even know how like food are gonna work like if the dining halls are open so today was all right went to work that was fine and took my midterm and the midterm was okay just one question that kind of worried about mean know did it right it was just i'd got like by looking at the graph i'd got different number than what lot of other people was saying so don't know we'll see if [people get personal] points for that but god i'm so angry because did response paper that was i've worked on it yesterday finished it yesterday it was due today at 1159 pm and forgot but didn't submit it and so [inaudible] i'm so angry because well [really how] we're able to get an extension of one day an extension for one thing and emailed him saying that would like to use it but the only problem is is that you have to like send that email before the actual like due date time so but sent screenshot of like the finder window that says that this thing was finished in time so would you al see [that] so maybe you'd make an exception for that but maybe not but it just so irritating because then like your grade goes down like one one personal letter grade so in order for so the best grade that can get on that would now be an minus and i'm so angry hmm because know could do well on that paper because really like my topic oh god hate life and hate it when do dumb thing so today um today was actually okay it was pretty productive um actually no the best thing ever happened in class basically um in my queer [inaudible] class to sum it up spoke in class but gave some like information that nobody even noticed before so we was working on fun home the comic book by alison bechdel and there was like some incidence when it was talking about like death and how the images can be used to um describe how she feeling about death without actually using the words and then so the the strip that it was talking about that we was talking about in class was when she was in record store and then it was flipping through the record and the only record that had it name visible was schubert um string quarter no 14 which was like oh hey that death and the maiden so then told told them and was like yo this is just one more example of how the images is is portraying this through even another media that that doesn't even use words that could portray how somebody is like coming to terms with death because death and the maiden is is maiden dance with death so it like she is kinda figuring out what death is so felt like so good and my professor was like wow di [laughter] she was like oh can't remember what she said she was like pulling out highbrow um uh something highbrow realization or doesn't know was like [inaudible] so that was that was great and then also so today was pretty productive finished my essay well on top of all my class um finished my essay did little bit of research read 40 pages in my book and um 40 pages in my book actually more it was probably [inaudible] yeah it was [inaudible] and um finished my essay read book did some research and finished my proposal my research proposal so then that good so now all have to do for friday is um the intro for my research paper for [expos] so that'll be so then i'll do that have lot to do this weekend which is not fun have so much to do every single weekend why is my life like this god hope pick easier class next semester today was all right um it wasn't that productive it was just really slow day got my [inaudible] thing done so that good um so everything that due friday is now finished also realized that didn't have to read my book until not this upcoming monday but the following monday so i'm not doing that until this week next weekend so then that means only have to do my psat and then some theory reading for um [inaudible] so my homework for the weekend is actually almost done like could probably i'll probably work on my psat tomorrow for bit but i'm not gonna do that much so that like pretty exciting um yeah other than that it was just kind of boring day i'm still trying to figure out if this guy in my [inaudible] is gay or not i'm so confused but asked my lab partner to hang out so we're gonna hang out soon which is great because he really cool so was going um on the sol bus today to [redacted] and they messed up with my ticket like they sent they to the sent the email where to pick they up to the wrong email list so wasn't on they so then that was like whole ordeal having to get they they was stressful and had to go pick they up right before my doctor appointment which was like time-crunching and stressful but then uh my doctor appointment was for counseling appointment so that was really nice to go to um but then just like getting on the bus my friends wanted to be with this other person and then when they [inaudible] they just became like so unbelievably stressful and i'm at [redacted] now they on the phone i'm at [redacted] now and my friends have been irritating me just because they've like been wanting to go to parties but then they've not been cooperating they've kind of been ignoring me and throughout the day and think they just 'cause they've been [inaudible] but they they still unbelievably frustrating that that how they're acting so today started off kind of irritating just because all my friends wanted to go to the tailgate and they were all they were like okay let all plan on being ready to go at 1030 and then so no they wanna [at] be there at 1000 so then that meant we would have to leave at be there at 1030 so then that would mean we'd have to leave at like 1015 so got my ass up and were ready by before 1000 and then walk over to my to my friends room where they're staying one of my friends [was] just sitting there with her bonnet still on they have done nothing and so they were just taking forever to get ready and then to eat and then to move and were like people this is unbelievable and and then were just like going around so saw my big sib and that were fun but then they were drunk and wasn't so they wasn't like that fun after long period of time and then felt like were just following her around so were like hey i'm gonna leave and they were like okay so they were [fun] to see her but yeah [it'd be hard to] party with her like that when i'm sober and they drunk um and then went to go see my friends at the [inaudible] tailgate and that were really fun and then went and met with this other guy that in my english class and ended up like [dancing on him] lot and they like really they really nice and cute they got some like quirks that kind of irritate me but that just to be expected with most people um but then were supposed to hook up with this one guy tonight and they like bailed so then were trying to find other people and nobody could do anything so then just kinda like stayed up for nothing like could've gone to bed at 1000 [just] right now i'm feeling sad i'm just feeling really lonely and also overwhelmed with school because have to write [whole-ass draft] by tuesday and my first two pages is shit like this is gonna be struggle this is really gonna be struggle this week so today was all right it was really um had really productive day where got all my homework done and then worked on my expos paper that due on tuesday and it only rough draft and so only have to write out of the 10 pages and already done so that nice um and was watched two movies for class read short story read two short story mean um read some stuff for expos did little drawing that had to do for my seminar yeah so today was pretty like productive didn't like go out of my room at all except for just to eat and to go to the film screening for the movies that for my [inaudible] class which it was good movies it was the innocents which is um some adaptation of the turn of the screw and loved it thought it was great movies um other than that today was like normal mean was little sad just because i'm feeling kind of lonely just feel kind of like weird i'm i'm in weird place emotionally and don't really know what to think of it or like what it why i'm feeling weird so that just strange so today was all right it was just like nor today monday yeah it was just like normal monday um nothing was too difficult um finished my expos draft so that good so really don't have to do anything tomorrow if don't want to um but i'll probably do some reading then went to the bookstore and got my friends from home some books that i'm gonna send to them in care package so just need to like um find some other little things that i'm gonna put in there to send them um but my first subscription birchbox came so i'm really excited for that i'm gonna use that um the only negative was was supposed to hook up with this one guy but then when he was coming to pick me up he realized that his like neighbors was there and he didn't want to like have them see them bring some person in at 1100 pm to hook up with so it was kinda bummer that got to miss out on that but think he gonna come over tomorrow afternoon and then we're gonna hang out with this other guy tomorrow night so you know i'm just back on that whole life but i'm living my best life that what told myself i'm gonna do um and then have like date planned with another kid think wednesday night where we're gonna wat-watch some movies and have like wine night or something and then just asked this other guy if he want to get breakfast with me tomorrow so we'll see how everything goes so today was um good day sort of mean yeah it was my last day of classes for the week since it um thanksgiving break now and got my [inaudible] midterm back so and got 92 which i'm so happy about and um like i'm unbelievably happy about that but um then afterwards went to hang out with this one guy who senior and we watched lilo stitch and some like tv show thing but we was kind of like cuddling but it was like kinda weird and we um we like kissed bit but mean i'm just awkward in general and so it was just kind of like it was just little little awkward um but mean it whatever but then came back home and hooked up with this guy he like god he like in his 30s which is ha it strange that did that again 'cause used to hook up with older men lot before but then stopped because realized that it was like unhealthy but then did it again so don't really know what should be thinking about that um yeah it weird but finished my book today and read one other book so that is pretty sweet um and my goal for the break is to read um this one little essay called on bullshit and then read my dad book um 'cause should really finish that um and so think it gonna be good week just just like really i'm kinda confused about the whole thing with that guy that hooked up with like don't really know what to think about the situation um so but i'll figure that out later so today was actually like really nice day didn't wake up until noon got some lunch with my friend from my [inaudible] class so we had like good long two-hour hangout sesh read my book on bullshit so that cool that i've read two book so far well i've finished three um so far this break um which is great and then was just about to start reading my dad book however don't really want to start right now since it kind of late um and yeah went to dinner and actually found um some people that knew so ate with them they're from my orchestra so that was cool um and then uh what else what else did do oh hung out with my friend my [inaudible] well first hung out with one of my other friend she came and she brought bottle of wine so that was nice we got to get little little tipsy from them bottle of wine then went over to my other friend and we drink some more wine and we lost [inaudible] but then today also did bunch of reading for my qc research paper so kind of have some idea of like what i'm gonna write which is good don't really know how to explicitly explain my thesis but know of like the structure of how want to like explain each thing um and yeah bad thing that happened yeah was just like little lonely actually wasn't that lonely it was just that you know was kind of lonely no it wasn't that was lonely it was just was cooped up in my room and so if the library was open later than it was or if like uh the art museum was open later then would've gone to that but then just didn't have time so today was um really good day woke up and went to my friend [redacted] house for thanksgiving and had thanksgiving with her family we all had really good time um and can't remember if explained this yesterday but started talking to some like austrian prince dude and so we talked little bit today so mean the only like negative probably would have been that we didn't talk lot but that just because we was both busy with thanksgiving stuff and then also have this zit on my crotch and it very irritating like it gigantic yeah the only th oh it bleeding now the only thing is that like have to sleep downstairs in the basement by myself so i'm little lonely but it okay so today was pretty chill day um woke up got breakfast with my friend 'cause spent the night at her house and um we came back cleaned up just did some had some me time and then oh worked on my essay so got some outline done well sort of have some outl like my version of some outline halfway done so have like my thesis written down and then just the plan for each of the the sections with like basically mini paragraphs just talking about like what what they're about um and what else did do read my book read 80 pages 90 pages of my book um what else went to starbucks hung out with my friend from my entryway we smoked some weed and now i'm really tired and messaged the [prince] today and uh wish he would like ask me to text it would actually be really cool to like meet him in person though so today was actually really really good day went to boston all by myself when um went shopping did some reading outside in the commons and like went shopping got some books and um was reading some of my dad read some of my dad books and um what else did do also went to get some vietnamese food that had it was actually really really good um there was guy though that came in after me and told the server after sat down that it came before did and was like um excuse me no that was 100 not true was so pissed was like can't let this bother me and didn't let it get to me which is good um but then i've been talking to [redacted] feel like to fucking call him that um i've been talking to him bit more so that good he sent me kissy emoji which was shook was like excuse me did not realize that we was at that level but i'm not complaining at all not even in the slightest because that is amazing uh he actually really cool and like talking to him but need to figure out way how to like not scare him off so um today was it was an all right today woke up and was gonna go to the gym but had stomach ache so didn't end up going that okay because then laid in bed for little bit went back to sleep watched movie for class it was dumb then went and got brunch with my friends and that was nice to see them again um yeah and so was talking to the one guy still and like uh i'm starting to get crazy because like when he doesn't text me back then i'm like freaking out really need to figure out how not do that so think like need to start meditating again or an shit um i'm extremely stressed out about my [queer] [inaudible] essay like really really am afraid that this is just gonna crash and burn be terrible terrible essay um but i'm almost done with my outline just need to go through the [inaudible] now like my main [bulk] and go through and write down bunch of quotes that might use because i've done that will all my secondary sources so then after that it would just be like going through and writing shit which like then that kind of it takes like the most brain energy but it probably takes the least amount of like prep time feel it takes the least amount of time feel like so once get all this stuff done then can like over the course of three days get 10 pages written out and i'd be good um can already though feel though that this is gonna be week full of procrastinating like have post-laber to do wednesday had told myself would do it today but didn't even look at it so that not good will however start it tomorrow at least start tomorrow um talked to my old lab partner today which texted which was kind of weird um actually he texted me that boy weird but he cool and wanna hang out with them just also because wanna be in [inaudible] club but he also cool like yeah well whatever so today was probably one of my most unproductive days that i've had in so long think all did just did my post-lab and then did my [pre-game] for lecture tomorrow and then like worked on worked on my essay outline for an hour at most so this it not good especially since this things are due in two weeks so i'm not happy with that um things are still developing with the guy that i'm talking to so that good think we're gonna facetime sometime soon um school are winding down but are not happy for finals to come and all so my papers i'm not ready for any of them um today was all right it was kinda like slow boring day um went to work work was fine didn't really do anything finished my outline for my paper and also started it got one paragraph done so that is good we're making progress however it probably one of the worst intro paragraph i've ever written just don't know what i'm doing think just really need to just go for it and then completely got it because it just not gonna be good for the first time through um was sad because the guy that like don't think he well don't know don't know if he just think that i'm like crazy person for wanting to facetime him like asked him if he wanted to and he said lol okay and so i'm like what do that even mean and could just be overthinking things but also don't know and i'm just crazy just want to know what other person is thinking um but when was sad had another guy come over and he brought me four bottles of wine so that is very nice um and we just hung out and we made out but nothing else which was good um finished my post lab so that all good probably uh the worst things was just that feeling that guy don't like me for know it i'm just overthinking things but can't can't do deal with like emotions any negative emotions so really really keep stressing out about um this guy um and don't really know what to do need to like chill out and hate it when this happens because then feel so annoying to my friends like can't like this is the only thing that talk about and was doing homework today was like somewhat productive but was doing at one point was doing relatively good job about like focusing on homework and not on on guy at all so that like just need to train myself need to just practice to not care and think it all has to do with just me not being on my phone or just not having my phone all the time so maybe like i'll go to class one day without it maybe i'll try that tomorrow yeah just at least for my section not for [inaudible] because i'll need it um for like breakouts or something um but just like not not has it for little bit think i'm just getting overly stressed and mean like want something to happens but don't know what would happens and it just kind of is unfortunate so i'm still like really stressing out about this dude just because like don't know if he like me or not and i'm just always stressing out about men and don't want to push him away but then also don't wanna like back off too much to point where he thinks that i'm pushing that like backing away like from him that don't wanna talk to him and so don't like know how to get that good medium of not being crazy person and like giving him some space which is just so hard um but today was my last day of classes so i'm very happy about that um however still have to work tomorrow at 900 so that is no fun so i'm going to go to bed in the next 10 minutes um what else went to cocktail party tonight it was lot of fun and then went to wine wednesday event it also was fun however perhaps should've just gone to bed to like get good night sleep that okay also got lot of work done today which i'm very happy about um so yeah thinks mean as long as i'm productive tomorrow as long as do work then thinks should be able to have good day like it'll be full but i'll have good day i'm drunk right now um my day was all right didn't have any class today so today is my last friday of of work also so that is quite nice um and let see what else oh my day was kinda busy had to do draft conference for [ex-boss] and like research presentation thing for queer canon and they both went all right but like hate having to do more work so i'm not happy about that but well it'll get done like i'm gonna try to get my queer canon thing done by soon-ish hope really hope that will be done soon that paper i'm really stressing out about and then like actually tomorrow and sunday i'm just gonna keep typing think should just go to the library anyways went to some boy birthday party tonight and they was fine we made out little bit but i'm i'm drunk puked um yeah so hopefully will be able to fall asleep without puking again but you know you never really know what what actually going on with your body so let see um positives went to the boy party and we made out little bit but then also i'm drunk so was like we should stop 'cause don't wanna be drunk into bunch of stuff even though know that want to but still don't even know how got that drunk 'cause feel like well also didn't eat barely ate anything so that the they don't matter because you don't really care about this right now well um i'm just little stressed about the end of the semester so today was um relatively good day got my draft on for my queer canon research paper the paper sucks but it all good um then also got my [inaudible] set done so then now i'm just onto oh have to write my ghost paper hope will do that um tomorrow i'm still writing that tomorrow after my concert 'cause my concert tomorrow but also facetimed um my prince and so guess things are looking up again don't know maybe it was [inaudible] in like doing stuff with sat that he was just too busy um but yeah he like we should start book club and read bunch of book this summer and was like hell yeah so yeah that going um the guy that [inaudible] out with last night did do submission last night uh was very drunk think did vaguely remember doing it last night but anyways i've made out with boy very briefly because was going to throw up was like we need to stop this um and then he took me home and so he texts me today he really sucks at texting though was talking to my other friend and i'm like wow i'm getting so attached to this prince who don't even like live close to here and it partly because think after that like mini relationship things that had with that one guy earlier in the semester it just kind of like shook me guess because that was the first time that actually was presented relationship that actually wanted to be in and then it still didn't work out so this was like the first time where was like wow something can actually come from this and then it didn't so just now don't want to go through something like that again and was just talking to my friend and she was like yeah we didn't really like talk about it much or give it as much time as or attention as we should have was like yeah 'cause it was like for certain amount of time it was important for me but don't know it weird um today was actually an extremely productive day got almost whole essay done only have few more um sentences to write just need to finish the conclusion didn't even realize did all that and finished my pset was that all did what time did oh bu i'm dumb and had my orchestra concert yeah so it was pretty busy day um and hung out with an friends had wine night tonight we watched elf it was we had an good time talked to [redacted] um i'm just trying to finesse my way into being friends with her um my prince is um we decided that we're gonna have book club together so we're gonna read master and margarita by mikhail bulgakov think starting next week just need to finish the book that i'm reading right now and then we'll do it so that actually cool that like we is still holding an sort of friendship so think i'm gonna just try to facetime him every once in while just to kind of keep things going um really don't know what i'm trying to get out of this relationship but you never know maybe if things last and if things last and he goes to [redacted] maybe long-distance relationship is feasible and he also said that he was gonna apply to [redacted] again so what if that would be pretty wild if he if he came like honestly honestly it'd just be it would really be crazy 'cause that other guy that made out with the other day um he just not texting me and that just not how want things to roll like if somebody like me want her to actively show it and my prince texted me all the time and he great texter so we we shall see we shall see so today was actually pretty productive day got my um [inaudible] paper turned in and got expos draft finished and edited the first half of it so that also good so that only have to edit like the last few pages which is so nice that have that almost done um did however turn in my um whichamajig my set late so that not good got zero for that so but that okay it gets dropped so i'm not so mad about it and also got um normstrom gift card today from my grandma for my birthday present it just been very very late got myself this really cool jacket that um was originally 450 but it was on sale for fif 150 and then got it because used my gift card only had to pay 50 so was so happy that can do that it like so cool it such good jacket love it and it it only 450 so that just helps boost my ego love materialism um also facetimed my prince again so that was like really it nice like talking to him and what else also went to the gym so yeah today was actually good day was little sad though because my friend went on date with this dude who really isn't good for her like he kind of emotionally abusive but she doesn't really know what to do about it and we just want to helps her and we just want her to be happy and we know that she can't be happy if she with this guy so we're trying to tell her to stay away we're trying but not like instruct her but like helps her see the light but it it just not working so it making me sad it not like making me angry that she not listening to me it making me sad that he like convinced her that whenever she feels bad it her fault and not his fault today was nice day didn't do that much edited my um qc paper need to edit it again 'cause did not edit it well enough but we shall see um yeah have like went to work got some pizza um hmm it was just kind of boring day i'm kind of like sad and tired don't really know what i'm sad about but just am and lonely and just want this semester to be over and want somebody to like me and don't wanna be so skinny anymore i'll probably go to the gym again tomorrow gonna ask my friend who went with yesterday to go with me today tomorrow but do need to work on my paper so i'll probably do that tomorrow we'll see i'll send in my dad on my paper so that he can edit it also need to stop spending money but you know what need to do lot of things will do all this things no but did get free beanie so that good so today was kind of like it wasn't the best day because had to go to work and um uh was just kind of like working on my essay and got my hopes up because thought was gonna facetime [redacted] but it didn't actually like work out for some reason and he just like wasn't texting me that much um and then had to go to dinner well not that had to went to dinner with my big [inaudible] we talked about finals clubs and it just kind of made me feel like well maybe don't really have as much of shot as thought did because maybe i'm not really that interesting or not like finessing the game as well as should be um but [inaudible] guess whatever and then also was supposed to have some interview today but my interviewer didn't call me so that also wasn't good then had my blue sky fair at 900 which was so boring so it was just like hour after hour was just waiting for something to happen and it never did but on good note did end up facetiming my [redacted] for some hour and half after um got home from the blue sky fair and we had like really good conversations it was really really good conversations um and we we talked for while and talked about my research it was just good like the only reason why had to hang up was because my other friend was coming and we smoked which was also really fun and then we went to the [redacted] and got some food and then back here [inaudible] but it okay it was like good end to kind of rough day so know am extremely um late to when usually do this but um hooked up with guy and was talking to another one probably [should have done a] so the guy that like just went to the bathroom um [redacted] facetimed him for three hours today which is unbelievable um and he helped me edit my paper and that was like really nice and um yeah that was good went to out [today] with my professor for [ls 1a] which was also good um that went really well and then hung out with this one guy hooked up with him we went and we smoked some weed got up to speed which was pretty great so i'm trying to get my footing into some of this [barnard clubs] but my face is have so many blackheads this is just disgusting oh my god what is wrong with me hate my face hate everything about my body yeah so but have to go to sleep soon because have lunch date with somebody tomorrow at 1100 [so] am just being ho so today was [redacted] which is the thing where we all where all of well okay where people run around the yard naked and have like weird feeling about i've thing with that one it just that it like it really makes me uncomfortable just because it like primarily white men which just kind of like it rubs me the wrong way in the sense that it like making me think that it just wanna show off their bodies so much that it don't even care about the fact that it is like flashing other people like in in any closed setting it would be it could be considered like sexual assault just from like being indecent and like showing yourself to somebody who wouldn't want to see that and it just kinda weird 'cause you don't see see very very few black men you see even less white women and there was zero black black women like absolutely none so it like kind of it kind of weird to think about that and then also just like the whole thing where like everybody running around and they're showing off their nice bodies and then don't have that nice little bodies and like all the people who is so confident in themselves and wish could do that don't want to [laughter] run around naked in front of people but wish did have the confidence to run to like not feel ashamed of my bodies um went out on breakfast date with or no lunch date had lunch date with somebody and turned in my last paper so all that stuff felt good but then was like really lonely and went to the library and finished my book um and ate dinner with all my friends oh and also had my interview thing that went pretty well so basically got summer like online job thing where i'm mentor for um people doing shit and getting ready for college so i'll makes some bank with that which is great um and what else read my book watched movie and watched the little prince which made me cry so was like crying for some hour straight and then like after the [redacted] just got really sad and lonely and wanted to go out but like there wasn't anything to do nobody was doing anything and just felt kinda left out don't know feel just kind of like secondary friends and don't really know what to do i'm just sad like i'm getting into like mood swings so should probably just go to bed like it good that i'm not going out and drinking or anything so just had an okay day it was kinda uneventful didn't do anything woke up oh today it um snowing um went to breakfast mean lunch went to lunch then went to the art museum with one of my friends and then got myself like little sketch book thing then went home and did an sketching and then went to dinner and then did an more sketching and then wrote my friends letter was listening to music like christmas music all day and then went to my friends house we got an snacks and we had wine night and watched movie and it was really fun um yeah today relatively it was just kinda boring and was kinda sad not boring but it was like chill but will still sad because was lonely and all my friends was doing work and stuff but then was just like hanging out by myself but it whatever and um i'm bored and really wanna hook up with somebody right now but nobody texting me back and don't know what to do might just like deadass text this one boy and be like yeah what are you doing you wanna make out but we'll see today was really kind of boring and didn't do much and was really kind of little bit sad everybody was busy and nobody was like texting me so was just reading and watching netflix in my room don't even know what did what did even do all day hang out with [redacted] for bit oh i'm not supposed to say names hell my friend bit 'cause she was leaving so was little sad then had to say goodbye um and the guy that like my prince he um didn't talk to me much today he was like reading my messages and not responding which really sucked not making me feel good and it really hard [inaudible] but other than that the day was like okay but was just reading not much else and it wasn't like that eventful it was just really lonely and i'm feeling kind of bad for myself so started studying for ls 1a today and it really really really sucks like studied three hours actually it wasn't three hours straight but it was solid two and half hours straight so like going over my notes and highlighting shit and it was the worst thing have ever done in my entire life and also went over this like set so that was terrible but went to dinner with this one upper-classman she so great she was like helping me think about what to do for the summer and just like life in harvard and wow went to coffee this morning with this one dude who goes to tufts and he so cute and he so cool and smart oh my god one why do the good why do all the gays goes to tufts and two why do he have to be studying abroad for all of next semester so won't see him until next fall so doubt he'll hit my line just because like it'll be year he'll forget about me uh so that not gonna be mean it all right and like just need to think of it as like it was fun fun thing to do and he was ballet dancer too but decided i'm going to take the non-credit ballet class next semester so i'm very excited about that for sure am going to do it i'm not gonna let myself back out 'cause that would be so cool and i've always wanted to do that so i'm just i'm doing it i'm gonna get myself some ballet slippers i'm gonna be looking cute we got this i'm gonna goes and buy some some clothes for it it'll be good but uh yeah i'm still lonely and then just don't know what to do about the prince just because like he life far away and don't know everything thing [inaudible] just like chill out from it like not not be too crazy so today was an extremely long day and hate studying so much but had work 900 to 1100 it was fine had to do little bit more work than usual and got little stressed for little bit but tried to control it so we was good everything good we was fine then came home took nap um don't know was kind of feeling lonely again the guy that went to coffee with um yesterday that was yesterday he still on my mind he probably gonna be on my mind for while and then um was did my cheat sheet today for that was for my final and that took so long and went through the review session so that also took forever but did do my laundry so that good and finally bought liquid laundry detergent so that will last me while um and facetimed the prince again but guess he not prince um and his family is just like wealthy but it he wants me to sign like non-disclosure agreement just because of like an of the companies that it own so but he didn't say wants you to sign it they'll be like he was like you don't have to sign it but it will send it to you so that you can like read it over think it was just kind of like jarring to hear that like one guess it deep enough that he wants me that he sending it to me and two that it like the stuff that his family do is crazy so well not crazy but it just like crazy how would be interacting with it today really sucked didn't do anything went to work hated waking up in the morning and then came back and laid in bed did little bit of reading but then took nap and then went to lunch was there for like an hour and then came home and did practice test was like that enough so then watched an tv and then did another practice test and then went to dinner and then went to my friend house and we hooked up and oh god was at dinner for like an hour and half like what the hell they like literally was out of everything at dinner they was terrible god yeah just today was not very good day was sad and was lonely but like didn't wanna be around people so they like that weird feeling and feel like people are just like leaving me out of shit and just feel done and i'm sick which are not good 'cause don't wanna be sick for my test but good thing was are after hooked up with my friend then felt better but now they back to normal of being sad so today was um really slow and kinda boring day it my last day of work for the semester so was kind of happy to leave um and then went home and took nap and read little bit and it was good nap then went and ate lunch um all like completely by myself um and then went and did practice test did pretty well on it and then went with my friend we studied bit together and then came back and read and then went to dinner with him um and some of his friend and chilled and then came back and i've just been reading and just hanging out on my phone and texting people and it been relatively good day i'm ready i'm i'm think i'm really ready for the test tomorrow so i'm getting up at 700 gonna lay around my bed for 30-ish minutes gonna roll around get up take shower go to breakfast at 800 hang out and then be ready for the test and am i'm not worried at all i'm ready i'm ready for it so that good the only thing is that i'm still kinda thinking like what should do with with my [redacted] just because like um just because like he lives far away and like him but don't want thing to be difficult because he lives far away mean if he willing to travel which feel like he might actually be then thing could be and like thing could work out feel like so we'll just see hate my life uh don't know why it just sucks and it terrible should be happy but i'm not was just at my friend and it was fun but the whole time was just feeling sad [inaudible] lonely and know i'll never be able to be in real relationship ugh so that sucks 'cause my whole thing with that guy that had thing with like early in the year is that that was the first time where actually thought that could have relationship and then it didn't so that was just great made me feel like well even when the opportunity presents itself and i'm able to have relationship viable relationship where one guy like me and like him too and we're in good spot then it just not going to happen and go crazy and then the whole thing with my [prince] and the guy that go to [redacted] is that like him both but on top of that it do not live anywhere near me and my [prince] is like don't don't know what going on with him with college and it sucks and don't know what to do don't know what to do with any of this ugh and like him but like the other the [redacted] kid that met and went date on date with on monday but he going he studying abroad so won't see him until next fall he'll probably forget about me by then or he'll be in relationship so it don't even matter none of this matter also 'cause won't be in relationship with my [prince] like know that won't happen and you know it just sucks [it] really really sucks fuck fuck don't know what to do but i'm packed and i'm ready go tomorrow gonna barely get any sleep but that okay i'll sleep on the plane or i'll read who cares it don't even matter but had final and thought the final went really well so that good but also who cares uh life just sucks in general so don't matter if get an don't cares hmm just wanna sleep forever just wanna sleep and do nothing so i'm finally back home made it to [redacted] finally so my day was terrible i'd to wake up at 600 am [redacted] time and then get on my flight that was at 900 but um there was like um engine fluid leak or something so it took them like two hours to fix it so missed my connecting flight so it had to send me fr to from [redacted] to denver then denver to phoenix and phoenix to [redacted] uh yeah so then instead of me being home at 100 pm um pacific um pacific time got home at 1000 1030 1030 so that was extremely frustrating yeah wow it was really really really frustrating had to travel that much and to be around all that gross people there was this one woman and she kept burping it smelt like salami and thought was gonna puke and then had to go and had to go to arizona and people in arizona am the worst no offense but they're like old and racist and annoying um and just remembered how gross place [redacted] is um i'm excited to see my friends but not really excited to do anything else 'cause there nothing to do and everyone here is ugly so first night back and i'm already ready to go back to [redacted] so today was just really irritable like had didn't wake up early but woke up relatively early um but for boston time it wasn't that early but still was like irritable and people kept asking me to do things and didn't wanna do anything and had to go shopping for people which meant that had to spend money and didn't wanna do that and was trying to read but my brain is being slow and wanted to hang out with friends but can't and wanna hook up with somebody here but like doing it is hard just like figuring out time and place and driving but we'll figure it out and everybody here ugly but i'm really tired almost fell asleep but remembered to do this am so tired um just got back from hanging out with my friends we went to like late-night diner thing which was really fun but today um yeah just hang out with friends we went to lunch and then to bookstore and then we started working on my songs but today was so tired did some reading which was good but when wasn't with my friends kind of just stayed up in my room and it kind of sucks doing that like wanna hang out with my family and stuff but just get irritated and don't know just like naturally wanna just go and lay in bed which isn't good but i'm just comfortable and i'm tired but think it just that like don't have my own space again which makes me unhappy 'cause like how have my own space back in college even though like share it still only share it with one person and he not there 247 and can like easily go see my friends like was talking to one of my friends and how can like it literally am 200 feet away from me so today was just kind of boring didn't do anything woke up at noon which is nice was just doing some reading um really didn't do much at all spent some time with just like sitting downstairs with my family which was nice then was going up to bed and my dad wanted me me to watch show and at first didn't want to but then said all right i'll do it and then my dad started just like nagging about like what we was gonna watch when we said that we wanted to watch tv show and it was irritating so we ended up watching one and then wanna go to bed so then after the first one said okay i'm leaving and then he was just nagging me so much and then don't understand why he thinks that that makes me wanna spend more time with him like he being irritating just to thinks that i'm gonna be like oh okay well didn't want to before but now i'm gonna be so i'll gladly stay like tha-that not how that works it just so frustrating it unbelievably frustrating and don't know why he can't just like leave me alone sometimes guess it so hard to just leave me alone god i'm really irritated so today was fine um it was chill calmer than yesterday didn't do anything just talked to my prince on the phone and really like him and he so cool turns out he worked on song that some guy won grammy for so that ridiculous and what else went and got my eyebrows done which that good thing of the day but then also one bad thing of the day is that because my like skin is so sensitive from my acne medication that my skin is like really thin and sensitive so then there some parts on my eyebrows that really really hurt so that sucks and can't put like lotion on him because it stings um we had like christmas but with my grandparents tonight so we just opened their presents that was fun and then went and hang out with one of my other friends and yeah it was good nothing that bad happened nothing that good so today um it was fine i've just been like lazy didn't do much went downtown with my friends which was fun but i'm spending way too much money so really need to stop so decided i'd pick some shifts up at the restaurant where work so i'm gonna do some of that um hung out with my friends that haven't seen to-tonight so it was fun and we drank little bit so that was also fun um kind of go back and forth with the prince and didn't like like want to have relationship with him but then also i'm like what is he like telling me the truth with everything so just don't know don't really know what to believe it like it really weird and then there this other guy that go to tufts he doing staying abroad which really like him but that sucks 'cause i'm not gonna see for like whole year and then there this other dude who he go to different school so i'm gonna hang out with him and there another guy at harvard and there is like couple other people at harvard so it like i'm just spread so thin and don't know what to do so i'm like kind of thinking about that and like what just wh-wh-what what do do and don't know also my parents have been like irritating me to no end it so frustrating like it just nag me all the time and i've been having headaches and it just make him so much worse so today was it wasn't the best day i've didn't really do anything at all like stayed in bed until like noon so like did some reading but it wasn't good feel like it was was distracted and stuff and it wasn't that like didn't feel accomplished um but did go and hooked up with somebody and it was actually like really really good not only was like the sex really good but it was also like he was good person to spend time with like he was really respectful and really hospitable too like afterwards he was like do you want some tea and was like of course do like of course want some tea and um and then we like talked for long time afterwards and he is some [redacted] grad and now he at [redacted] so it was like really interesting and really nice then went to my friend house and we played mario kart for bit it was fun then we went to my parents' friend house for dinner but went home early and then still didn't do anything just read 20 pages of my book just laid around on my bed so oh took bath but really didn't do anything today and i've felt like kind of bombed 'cause wanted today to be productive for some reason but just really was not so today was fine it started off kind of irritating just because like had to be with my family and it was just being frustrating and wanted to be alone but couldn't we went um to brunch and we saw movie and then after that spent some time by myself so that was nice um but then so today is my christmas since we're going to hawaii tomorrow so we opened the presents and stuff and got lot of good stuff that like like lot of clothes and stuff um so that good some face stuff um and got some shoes but they're not here yet yeah so uh got some books that wanted so that good um i'm reading my books right now that don't really like but just just need to finish it 'cause you know yeah just just should and what else um um know was gonna say something oh yeah there this guy so the whole thing with the guy that with the prince who lives in minnesota don't really know how thing is gonna work out just because like want somebody to be with me all the time but then he also like really cool but it don't seem like he really doing much for me like i'm not stressing out i'm telling myself not to stress out like there was point today when could have stressed out but i'm like i'll just drop it i'm not gonna deal with this at all i'm not gonna worry about this so that was good then there that other guy who goes to [redacted] who going away which sucks because he would be back and he would be super cool then there this other guy who senior at [redacted] and he re cool but don't really don't really know and don't wanna lead him on but don't think i'm leading him on and and said to him like i'm just coming at this slowly i'm not am looking for relationship but i'm not going to get attached immediately so yeah don't don't know what to do god this is so stressful three people that like one that really like who don't lives here one that also really like who is going away for semester and then one that like but just don't know if like him as much as like the other two guy and don't know if he the type of people that just like want to date for semester and then be done so i'll see so we just we're in hawaii now and it been really long day had to wake up super early which sucked but our flight was fine and did lot of reading um mean and told myself that i'm just gonna be chill not gonna worry about any boy so if it want to talk to me it can but if not then it doesn't matter because doesn't care and i'm just gonna be here i'm gonna read i'm gonna get tan i'm gonna look nice i'm just gonna have chill week chill week so bad part was that had to wake up super early and that we was traveling for such long time and then definitely by the end was just getting really irritated and just wanted some space but then now that we're here it better and feel like can actually chill and not have to do anything which is very nice because we doesn't have any-anything planned for any day except for one day we have something at like 200 pm and that it good part i'm in hawaii so yeah that nice bad part is it still like little chilly it not that hot out i'm doing this so early because i'm so unbelievably tired have not even been awake for 12 hours but have to go to bed because otherwise i'll just keel over and die um but it was really relaxing day read read good bit of my book which was nice didn't do anything but i've been hungry and the food we've been eating honestly isn't that great actually you know just generally haven't been feeling that like satisfied with things like don't know i'm not having like the most fun could be having wish was with my friends and don't know and kind of wish was home this is the first time [they've] ever been like on vacation don't want to really be here like don't know how to enjoy this 100 so mean there so many things that like wanna do and that i'm frustrated with and that kind of like clouding everything where where it supposed to be like relaxing things but it just hard to make it that um but hope sleep in and got to try to go to the gym tomorrow 'cause didn't today and i've convinced myself that should and then felt bad for myself when ended up not going and then figured out that one of the guys i'm talking to he go to the gym and then that just make me feel bad because he was good and i'm like oh shit now should start doing it oh he just so cool he the guys who go to [redacted] i'm sad because he taking he studying in [redacted] all of next semester [inaudible] [sad] to be doing that to me huh today really was all right we was just driving around the island and um my dad was being kind of irritating just because he was like being super stubborn and just like annoying in general which was really frustrating and so just like had to every once in while just go off and be by myself just to cool down which is what i've been doing lately and it has been helping feel like when i'm in these situations that really stress me out and make me mad um but finished my book so that good 'cause it was not very good book but i'm glad that finished it and also went to the gym which make me feel good just like not only immediately after leave because that always is good feeling but then also just like about myself in general and i'm gonna try to go again every day that i'm here just to like get into that feel like that good thing to practice and then so when get to school i'll be able to do it more so today was good day um went to the gym again which boosted my self-esteem and stuff and made me feel good after left um but the guy from [redacted] who going away just decided let it go and if you're if i'm not in relationship then then i'll hit him up and i'm sure i'll remember him but if not then if am in relationship then i'll just chill 'cause right now it um uh it not gonna do me any good just stressing out about it so that was one good thing that accomplished and then also just didn't like do anything really today read some walt whitman but then was got bored and then opened this pushkin book but now i'm getting bored of that too so maybe i'll read one of my other two book kind of wanted like good fun novel but didn't bring one but that okay maybe like fun sci-fi book something like that to read that'd be good but have this two other nonfiction book which might read might would start wouldn't be able to finish so today was um all right wasn't the best day it wasn't terrible day again we really didn't do anything finished one of my short stories which was good um went to the gym which was good there was other people there so that was kind of like helping me boost my confidence for when actually do have to go to the gym when other people are there so that i'm not completely embarrassed of what i'm doing and also um but was kind of stressing about guys for little bit like the one guys that go to fisher he didn't text me snapchat me or anything all day so that on him you know don't really care so it whatever just wanna know like why was he busy do he all of sudden not like me like feel like that not the answer but don't know you never know but really shouldn't let it get to me so today was um it was okay it started off kind of bad where was like stressing out about guys again but then we went on really long hike and that was like kind of cleansing and we didn't have to think about much which was good and then we had really really great lunch and then just did nothing by the pool for while and also went to the gym which was good but the rest of the day was just kind of boring and and i'm tired but am ready to go back home so that can see my friends and that can be like distracted from all this stuff again and think with the guys that just like didn't respond to me at all and he didn't do it today either well didn't text him or send him anything in the first place but he didn't send me anything so i'll probably be like hey we talked about being all straightforward and stuff but um we but you like didn't respond to me so was just wondering why 'cause it didn't make me feel good at first so i'm at the airport right now and i'm doing this at this time because we're like gonna board in 10 or so minutes so decided to do it now instead of waiting um today was fine it was actually like good day don't think anything really bad happened we had nice breakfast then we was just like hanging around hmm [haven't been going] [inaudible] at the [cities] and eating food i'm kind of hungry right now but it not that bad i'm just really tired though i'm very excited to go back home one to see my friends two to smoke three to just like eat and be in my own bed again [inaudible] but um decided so tomorrow i'll text that guy that still has not texted me back so it been like thursday all of thursday all of friday all of saturday and then so sunday i'll be like yo what up what happened um and just see what he says because you know feel like it just kind of douchey way to do it just like having still not talked to me at all it is not my job to like keep reminding him to text me back so uh just little frustrated but um definitely text him when like when land and then i'll go take nap or something and and then hang out with some of my friends and like we'll go shopping so that'll be good so totally forgot to do this right now and that why i'm doing it so late um and it because it new year so was having fun with some of my friends it was actually really really fun it was only three other people we worked on my ou-our ep which is just this like dumb thing where we're making shitty songs it be really fun it was really fun night and talked to the one guy who ghosted me and said yo don't this wasn't cool don't know why you're doing this and please just tell me and he was like was just really busy with work and was really nervous and didn't know what to do so i'm like well understand that but you're like making it hard for both of me so it hopefully back to normal think so think it just like because it [inaudible] that we're not talking as much but then also was talking to the one guy from [redacted] he uh he [honestly] the nicest human being i've ever met in my entire life and then so before this morning was like okay i'm done i'm just gonna focus on [redacted] because [redacted] guy isn't gonna be back for the year and i'm not into um this other guy that not gonna happen anymore so we will just see we will see how thing play out because now it back to all three of them is possibilities except know that the guy from [redacted] that not really possibilities even though he tell me [himself] it is it would have to be like whole year [inaudible] suck so today was fine um [it] was really really really tired and had terrible headache um basically all did was just wake up go to see star wars with my family 'cause [this is] my mom birthday and then we came home did this like tax thing for my new job with collegevine and then um we opened presents [and li was doing like uh some] piano stuff called talked to one of my friends from school on facetime and that was nice and then called the other guy that was like having some weird troubles with like earlier few days ago so that was nice to talk to him and like to have him show that he does still like me 'cause he was the one who called me so yeah don't know was just feeling sad lately and think need to just really take break from boys like talking to him but i'm just going to go to him and say hey like um i'm not ghosting you or anything i'm just taking like cleanse from my phone because feel like especially when i'm here and have nobody to hang out with really then and even like no guy to be with then just like get sad because i'm constantly talking to him um but then it like not going the way that want it to and then can't actually see him anytime soon so then that also makes me feel sad so it like can't it impossible to be happy with what going on so think just need to like really take break and reset and then come back to all of this stuff when i'm ready so today was pretty fun am at one of my friend lake cabin we're staying here for couple nights and we're like alone and we're having good time we drank bit but now my tum stomach kinda hurts but not in like like an alcohol thing it just like mix between that and like shitty food so that kinda sucks um but do definitely think it good for me to be off of my phone for couple days 'cause we don't have service or wi-fi or anything um but the only thing that kinda sucks is that it cold the water in the cabin don't work so we have to go to the like the laundry room down the road to use bathroom and stuff which sucks 'cause need to poop but don't wanna go right now because it really late had really really good day today um woke up at like noon um my friends and we made pancakes and then we went out on walk we started off in like the forest but it was the snow was really deep so we made my way out onto the lake which was frozen and we took bunch of pictures and it was really fun listened to music and there was these other dogs like guess the maintenance man up here his dogs came and ran out to us and it was little labs and it was so cute and probably the most well-behaved dogs i've ever seen in my entire life it was such good dogs and then we just kind of hung out we played games we was like drinking all day my stomach doesn't hurt today which is good despite the fact that we ate ton of cheese and gnocchi but that fine um we played some video games think i'm excited to go back home just because then get to like take shower and stuff but i'm glad that did get to do these and have break from like the internet and all that shit even though was still kind of thinking about all of it like about guys and stuff it wasn't like it wasn't there and couldn't do anything about it which definitely helped so think maybe if if do these every once in while then it could be helpful little like restart thing and then the other thing is think the guys who go to [inaudible] so he leaving for spain tomorrow and think that'll be good for us just because then he'll be gone for little bit and he won't be able to talk we said that we'll keep like talking and keep snapchatting ca try to keep streak up so we'll do that and he was like yeah you and you're not [inaudible] only if you send us bunch of stuff so that that good um i'll just so that'll probably help us with that just doesn't know it kind of hard 'cause probably should just keep him off my mind especially if i'm starting to like these other guys who go to school in downtown boston especially if i'm like thinking that need to do something with the prince but doesn't really know but other than that there like little residual thoughts everything else was really good so today was fine it was just like normal day we got back from camping or whatever that was just going to my friend like cabin and it was really good to not have my phone for while immediately went on it but you know it okay and saw one of my friend for the last time before he goes back to school so that was nice to see him but also kinda sad it was kind of boring we just went to one place to take picture but that was it but you know that all that you really need um started the training for my new job thing so i'll probably finish that by sunday hope maybe saturday and hmm talked to the guy from [inaudible] and thought was getting over him but then we started talking more and he just like he does lot of cool thing too and we started then we was talking we was having like really good conversations about like being on the phone and like social media and getting excited from it and feeling like you always have to be caught up but then also having your self-worth be determined by it and think that not think know that that my whole problem but he was like so understanding about it ugh so hmm and there nothing can does about him either it just wait or ignore him and i'm not gonna ignore him so you know it whatever so today was nice and kind of boring day feel like say every single time didn't really do anything but today really didn't do anything woke up at like noon and um was doing that [inaudible] my training for my new job which has just taken me little bit of time it not that bad but um and then got haircut which is really making me feel myself 'cause that it really good haircut like my hair cutting lady wow she just she cut my hair really well it ridiculous and what else went out to dinner at the place where used to work so that was cool to see all of my old friends and uh what else what else um the other thing that happened was oh was playing the piano little bit and was talking to the guy from [redacted] again just talking more he like classical music too so there he literally has just become my perfect man which is very unfortunate and but was kind of like telling myself it okay you know just chill out it not that bad there nothing you can do about it and so was like trying to distract myself with random thing and kind of feel better but only sort of like know it i'm not really there like know i'm that i'm just ignoring it it not affecting me but it the problem hasn't gone away which mean won't be able to do anything about it so at this point that just all can do but just need to figure out how to really focus on other thing and think like once school starts then it won't be that big of problem because it just right now has nothing to do so that all can think about um i'm gonna try to has very minimal phone time usage tomorrow probably little bit when wake up do some snapchats but then just like leave it in different room for while for most of the day really wanna practice piano quite lot tomorrow and then also finish my training also need to run to my friends house so can get my water bottle since left it um today was normal day nothing exciting happened made dinner for my family which was kinda cool need to start learning how to cook [inaudible] made some made us some puttanesca sauce which was pretty good but it was one of my friend last day at home so we hung out tonight um yeah had good conversation about race with them which was actually like really good conversation partly because it was like listening or not being all defensive and shit like people usually are which was good um but what else was practicing piano lot more finished my training things have to talk to my manager but i'm not like super 100 certain on all of the stuff so will definitely need to go over it some more yeah i'm gonna do some stretching still little bombed about [top's] guy and with the other guy back in boston who will go out on date with he doesn't text us that much which uh definitely are things that irritates us so if anything go with them i'll talk to them about it so today wasn't really the best day um we went shopping and got some new gloves so that was cool but other than that really didn't do anything started black mirror which is kinda cool but also kind of just like don't really like watching tv i'm gonna be honest with you feel so unaccomplished when i'm done only like to do it if if i'm with somebody else um especially when i'm like bored 'cause when i'm bored want to do something productive but then when just fill my time with something unproductive then i'm like well now just feel like dumb well not dumb but just like feel like i've done absolutely nothing um the other thing that was gonna say oh yeah so um i'm just trying to feel more attached to this guy that actually lives in boston [inaudible] studying abroad still like him but really need to [inaudible] had to tone it down with him so like maybe tomorrow i'll snapchat him and keep my streak going but i'm not gonna text him unless he like text me first guess but don't even know if should do that think just really need to have like day or two again of it like don't really know what to do at this point 'cause it is that just wanna be in relationship just get so obsessive and don't know how to stop feel with during school it was lot easier because had thing to do and stuff was on my mind but then now that i'm back here and just have so much time that like don't know how to control myself don't know what to do and don't have like friends to hang out with here because they're all gone it already all left maybe i'll do some writing tomorrow that what i'll do just did little bit of reading but not lot maybe writing is gonna be my thing for the year or reading it was reading last year maybe it'll be writing this year today it was today was weird day so it started off fine kind of productive was eating taking shower and stuff and then did little bit of writing and had my conference call with my manager and that went really well so i'll start everything tomorrow um and let see what else watched all of season of black mirror which was fun played little bit of piano called the guy who i'm going out with on date with when get back called him and we talked for while and that was nice like talking to him but deleted all of my social media except for snapchat just because need definitely need cleanse so we'll see if delete snapchat don't know the whole thing is just with the [inaudible] guy is like i'm so hung up on him don't know how to take step back know have to but don't know well could just stop talking to him for while could say hey like you but i'm like in place right now where when talk to you every single day it just get hard for me so maybe should just stop for while or don't know say like hey can keep the snapchat streak up if you want but it will probably only be like one or two snapchat day just so can help myself might do that yes it bummer having to like say that guess i'm going to my old therapist tomorrow so i'll see what she say she might think that good idea or have another suggestion life is hard just decision-making is hard and the other thing that was thinking about is if end up dating this other guy how am going to like end it when [inaudible] guy [inaudible] guy comes 'cause don't think that th-this guy that i'm talking to right now definitely is the the guy that know wanna date for long time don't know yeah it just weird 'cause then i'd feel bad if like dated him knowing that no matter where he at i'm gonna wanna end it at the time at the beginning of fall semester so that just kind of douche move of me so today was um better than like yesterday guess went to my old therapist um for the first time since i've been back and that was really good she has kind of helped me um she just helped me like decide that i'm not really gonna wait for [redacted] i'll see him when he comes back but oh i'm not oops um the [redacted] guy but for the other guy who goes the other guy that gonna be in [redacted] goes out on date with him because it might be that don't even end up having relationship with him so just like that you're going to [fall] 'cause honestly he just isn't up on with the guy from [redacted] this isn't relationship where would expect that he would wait so shouldn't expect myself to wait mean know what i'm doing but it just like it just bummer that has to that has to settle with guess um just started my job um and i'm supposed to be taking clients now but there only like one clients and she don't match with my like personality or something so i'm not sure if i'm supposed to do that person or wait or don't know so we will we will see we'll see what happens so today was really really shitty day in general um didn't do anything basically just watched lot of tv did some reading and played little bit of the piano and did some work but it was just like checking up stuff and sending emails and shit but not anything actually like working working so hopefully i'll be able to like pick up clients soon hmph but i've just been like really sad and lonely today kind of back on my old shit where i'm like nobody like me and nobody wants to date me or anything nobody giving me the attention that wants so start to feel bad about myself but before it was like would make it into like self hate or something where would just be like oh i'm not attractive or something but it wasn't bad it was just like that residual feeling but it was only the residual feeling of like people don't i'm just it was just me being extra lonely guess and just feeling like nobody wanted to talk to me or hang out with me even though the people was like snapchatting me but it it wasn't satisfying and that the thing is that it never gonna be satisfying didn't go on my phone for solid four hours which when say it don't sound that impressive but mean it felt like really long time and the prince um has boyfriend now so let [leave it at that] am at this present moment don't get enough attention that wants from guy who actually living in [redacted] right now and the [redacted] guy is gone think today was his first day away and he opened my snap and didn't respond but he busy it don't really matter just kinda bummed about that ugh and then got like little stressed thinking about school and having to do schoolwork and working for my jobs and then also having like social life and trying to figure out when i'm doing all of this shit but we shall see we will see where it all plays out so today wasn't as bad as yesterday it wasn't necessarily bad day um kinda just did my normal thing ate food and um watched tv and played little bit of piano did little bit of reading was kind of bummed but kind of sad but not really more than any particular day think it was really just because i'm bored and lonely don't have anything to do and i'm kind of stressed about school but not really like i'm not stressed but then know i'm not stressed but when have nothing else to think about then my mind just like starts inventing stress which is irritating and like was feeling sad earlier for no apparent reason and [inaudible] the other day was just angry for no apparent reason or actually no there was reason it was because [redacted] he was just being kind of irritating lately where he just always talking about himself and then when try to talk about like one of my problems or something and then he just like don't engage at all or like he was he facetimed me he was saying how all of his friends is coming to him with his problems and he like have my own problems need to deal with and i'm like well you do see recognize the fact that these people have problems but it is still helping you with yours so it kind of like he just think that his is the most important which is frustrating um and it was especially frustrating today but from tomorrow only have one more week so that exciting so today was um guess it was as normal as any other day really was bored and lonely finished my book though which was nice that feel like actually got something done um and went to dinner with my family and we ordered bottle of wine and the server just poured me glass without id'ing me so that was pretty cool um but what else i'm going out to the mountain tomorrow don't really want to just because there gonna be nothing to do there there gonna be less things to do up there and my one friend who in here won't be there and it gonna be some tighter quarters than and he here so i'll definitely need to do something to like get out of the apartment bunch or else i'll go crazy um but it only for the long weekend which is good and hopefully i'll get like maybe some work done or something that get paired with somebody so saw these two people that wanna get paired with but it both requested female mentor and i'm gonna see if can like sneak my way through that 'cause i'm cool i'm one of the cool one so today was um it was normal day we came to the mountain and it it fine um was just doing like nothing the whole time um watched whole season of tv show and literally just stayed in the apartment the whole time it really really really boring um but the other thing that like really frustrating me is i'm trying to look at internship stuff and research stuff for next summer but all of [redacted] thing is so so inconvenient and so difficult to deal with it incredibly frustrating um but figured out that so requested to um be the mentor for this one girl who she was like into humanities and music and stuff but she requested female mentor but then my manager said you can still request her and we'll like see if she wants to work with you and stuff [inaudible] so we'll see if that work out so today was really really really boring again did nothing except for watch some tv do little walking eating read some of my book which was also nice that was good um but i'm so happy to be going back home tomorrow 'cause this has been one of the most boring vacations ever um and wish was back at school and um was looking for things to like research things to do in [redacted] over the summer could do something but it sucks because like for all the programs that give me money i'm not gonna be able to do them in the right hours so it really really sucks so there one that i'm gonna like email them and see hey you think you can scooch this little bit and then also get like meeting with somebody in the office of career services to help me figure out what can do um let see if can get anybody for working anywhere um yeah 'cause this is kind of stressful figuring lot of stuff out um what else i'm starting to get stressed out about money and like don't know how i'm going to be paying for all this stuff how i'm gonna be paying for college and shit 'cause let see probably has like 16000 that will need to pay in the end so will has to make don't know like to thousand dollars year for that save up for that um which would kind of sucks um um and then like on top of that getting money for everything else because think did the little searchy-search things and if for if work eight hours week on average for every week for this semester or fall semester plus what i'll be making for two mentor mentees plus my research things then i'll probably has 5000 at the end of the year which i'm gonna need more than that 'cause wanted to put 5000 away whatever we'll figure this shit out later so today was um was all right went to go see movie with my friend um it was really good movie it was we saw tonya it was so good it was such good movie and the acting was really good um did some reading i've been reading the this book called why i'm no longer talking to white people about race and it getting better the more read it so don't have much more to read think only have like 35 pages left so i'll finish it tomorrow um [redacted] guy started texting me again after he was ignoring me for don't know few days so but really should stop like wasting time with guy like that so maybe if after we go out on date and we like it should say something about that because i'm not about to just like sit here and stress out about guy not texting me don't wanna have to do that and i'm some adult now i'm mature so can deal with this can can handle this stuff the way that want and don't need anybody stressing me out today was okay hung out with one of my friends that hadn't seen in while but it was kinda weird because we had hooked up bunch in the past but tried to make move and he said no and of course respected that and was like okay totally good but then felt bad mean i'm sure everyone feels bad after that but at least was listening to him being like consensual that always good um finished my book did some online shopping watched movie with my parents which is it was all fine um nothing that exciting i've been on grinder and it been so frustrating just because then there would be guys who like talk to me and it get interested but then it just stop talking to me out of the blue which is extremely frustrating because just wanna meet up with someone before go and could just delete the app and be like you know what no but can't because have no self-control and uh it also feels like passing the time because i'm trying to think i'm [inaudible] hook up with this guys but there only three more days well now only two more days wednesday and thursday until have to go back um but then there this other kid he was in my one of my classes and he was senior in high school and he like is talking to me about all of his hookups and stuff and like how he think it gonna be so great and how everyone tells him that he gonna hook up with ton people when he get here and don't know it just really really annoying like he really immature about it and i'm talking to one of my friends and we've concluded that he definitely doing it just try to try to seem cool but it so frustrating just wanna say dude be quiet you're being annoying people don't talk like this but i'm just like whatever just ignore it so today was fine um went out to dinner with my parents for the last time um while we're here so it was nice and we had good food um and hung out with my friend and we had good time we watched westworld and went to his hot tub which was really it was just nice time also started new book i'm almost done with that it only like it non-fiction like collection of essays but it only 84 pages so really isn't that diff well it little it kind of difficult but it it just doesn't take that long um was feeling like generally oh also had to go get my passport my new passport which was really stressful for some reason um but other than that generally felt okay got to call the guy from boston so that was nice that we could talk um but everything else was normal guess was kind of little sad by the end of the day just because my one friend was telling me about computer science class he taking where he like logs all of the words in horror stories to try to see what words in what progressions like make writing scary got kind of like pissed just because was like well see how that like take lot of thought and stuff but it the wrong kind of thought when you're analyzing this kind of english because it not just like mechanical comparisons feel like they're they're the overall the overall parts that give you the feeling and like understand that that parts it could just search for them but then without the original analytic thought like the actual good stuff stuff that was true interpretation then you wouldn't even have basis for that and like to what extent is every single words giving that meaning there have to be so many different words that that give book feeling like that so doesn't know and then that triggered something weird but it was just me feeling lonely and that needed somebody to talk to but i'm back and and i'm about to go to sleep so feel better so today was my last full day at home and it was pretty uneventful day just did laundry finished my book watched some tv did some piano um you know it was kinda like [inaudible] day didn't talk to many people conversations weren't that long i'm really really didn't do anything 'cause it kind of slowly went by quickly feel like like in the moment felt like so bored like it was just moving so slowly but then now lying in bed i'm like this day went by really quickly am little sad that i'm leaving well i'm just sad that i'm leaving my family and stuff my bed am really excited to go back to school and hang out with all of my friends and not only to start my new classes but then like the ballet classes i'm really hoping that this will be transformative semester for me not just emotionally but also physically like with the classes hopefully that'll just make me more active and i'm don't think i'm biting off more than can chew right now think i'm just loading myself up with with stuff that it not particularly it like set amount of stuff per week so like with ballet that don't come home with work that don't come home with mentor that only like maybe max three hours week once have two mentees and have zero right now so that the only thing that i'm like not stressed guess i'm keeping it in the back of my mind and decided to apply to that inter one of the internships just because if get it then can decide if wanna fly home or not or can see if can modify the dates but if can't do any of that then i'll just decline that instead say something came up so i'm back at [redacted] and i'm so happy that i'm here got to see few of my friends which was really great um and the plane rides was okay was actually like really bummed because [redacted] again wasn't texting me like don't know why it was stressing me out so much and hope that now that i'm here it not gonna be that big of deal but think like with that the guy who who goes to school here if he 'cause he keeps ignoring me so if he don't change that we're seriously gonna have problem and it not to the point where it like me being crazy person where have to have him text me constantly it like he just opening multiple messages and not responding with like just don't know and it really frustrating know he like not ignoring or know that he not like mad at me or trying to ghost me or anything but it really frustrating when he does that so don't know we'll goes out [inaudible] date with him and see how it goes but if it gonna keeps being like this i'm just gonna say no 'cause i'm i'm not gonna put myself through that and so like was getting stressed out before and was like you know what i'm gonna talk to different guy right now because don't need to really make that big of deal out of this right now don't need that in my life had pretty good today day today um it was really fun got to see all my friends again it all came back so we all hung out and like went to dinner and went to breakfast and it was the women march today so that was like really good we didn't actually like march it was just rally but it was nice to go to that um it was really goo saw lot of friends and it was great to catch up with them all um and hooked up with this one dude and was like we was talking lot and we was having great convo it was great we started making out and stuff and then um like he finished but was hard before but then for some reason just lost it and don't know what happened and don't know i'm like feel like everybody gets slightly embarrassed and kind of am but also don't really care but als only sort of care because i'm like hope he don't feel weird about it hope he don't like feel like oh don't like them anymore because he couldn't gets hard or whatever but we was like hey you wanna go for little walk like it was 10-minute walk it wasn't anything um afterwards feel like we could do something after hookup then like definitely makes it not awkward because if that was kind of awkward mean it only awkward if you makes it awkward and so don't know we'll see if he texts me back well mean said had fun time thanks for going for walk and he was like did too and though i'm the walk was nice and then said good night so don't know we'll see if um if he texts me or i'll probably texts them again sometime later and be like hey you wanna just go gets some coffee do something tame and if things am looking up then sure it just weird don't like ending things on weird notes like that not saying that this is over but mean hope that it not over would like to go out to coffee with them some other time don't know feel kinda bad for like making them stay up later though just because he was like oh-- whenever we was finished he was like yeah have to gets up at 830 was like oh sorry did that so don't know i'll be like hey hope it wasn't too bad how about oh that smart how about buy you coffee to makes it up yeah smooth that what i'll do and if not then who care don't have to buy somebody coffee just no the one things is like gossip 'cause don't want that to gets out mean mean don't care mean do sort of care but really don't think it just things at the moment that kind of care it like kind of so had really really really great day today saw all my friends went out to family brunch and it was so great and then there was some other friends there too so we was there for like two hours just having fun and it was lot of fun and then saw one of my other friends in my entryway and we act like pi we played piano together and it was it was really nice and then worked on my cover letter so felt like was being productive and hung out with some more friends and we was all together and then we went to track meet to see one of my friends like don't know she was like sort of interested in him but it was kind of like weird but it was nice to just like do something with with people and then went and saw my other friends who just got back and we caught up and it was great and love her so much and then went out on like date with this dude where we went and we got dinner and we walked ar-around downtown lot and it was so much fun and then we went back to his apartment and we tried to watch movie but we was just talking the whole time we drank lot and we had lot of fun and he really fun guy and um and then he kissed he like came back to my dorm and he like kissed me goodnight which was so cute and it was great so don't know re-downloaded tinder because i'm dumb people because my friends matched with some dude that was really cute who had no idea was gay so then was trying to like trying to match with him too and still haven't [inaudible] and know need to delete it so at some point this week will delete it um but i'll see that guy again on thursday which will be really nice and he he he really cute he really funny and like him the only problem is that he lives far away and don't really have the funds to go out on like date with him all the time so the only problem with like dating somebody who don't go to [redacted] is can't just be like come over and chill with me or like watch movie or watch some tv or just like let go do homework together like can't really do that it not like the distance isn't really great for that so i'll like if things develop i'll have to talk to him about like what we're really gonna do because don't wanna have to spend money every single time we go out on date so today started off fine it started off as good day woke up at like 900 and took my time and took nice long shower and then went to breakfast then hang out with bunch of old friends then went to my first [inaudible] class and it was really cool but then um got then went to lunch and things started going downhill so my stomach started hurting managed to shove down all my food after like an hour but didn't even didn't finish all of it but it was like almost all gone so was like okay i'm just gonna just call it day and then um went back home and did like little bit of meditation which was nice went to work and worked 100 to 400 and actually had great time like talked to bunch of people [again] there this new dude that was kinda helping and was chatting with him lot and he was nice oh and he so gay too it so funny um but the um the good day at work was all just trick because the ballet registration came on while was at work and when got off and off of work and then went to go on to the registration page it was all full my class was already all full and the first people on the waiting list which means that like somebody just did uh don't even know how many people are registered it sucks like [inaudible] and then was just talking to bunch of people and started feeling bad then started feeling bad about my body and stuff just because like everybody else are working out and now my like one motivation to actually do it are gone um but i'm gonna go tomorrow morning and morning workout sucks but i'm just gonna have to do it so i'm gonna go to be like now was gonna go to bed earlier but then just took forever um and then was sad because that guy that had things with before but it ended badly um it didn't end badly but it just ended badly for me like was just kinda left in the dirt which really sucks and was just treated shitly and it wasn't fair for me and that kind of like what i've conclu-conclusion but anyways it was his surprise birthday party for me and all my friends was talking about it and was like damn this are just bringing back all of my bad memories and shit and like try to joke about it and be fun with it but it it it still sucks but this other guy that kinda like now means he really nice dude there are an things about him where i'm like that not my favorite well it just like an things that he talks about but really don't care it like it things where we we can actually have conver like good conversation about it but it not something where it like deal breaker it like we have the same thoughts about lot of stuff but then we differ on like little tiny things about this big things so it kind of good that can still have good discussion where we will have different opinions but that it won't be that bad but means he out with his friends right now and i'm alone and sad so today was like halfway good day halfway bad day started off good woke up early and worked out with my friend we went to like total body circuit and workout video not workout video workout class which felt really good after um and then had nice and easy time at work um let see what else else would be god the professor is looks to be irritating um but with african american lives in the law that class is gonna be really really really difficult but it'll be think it'll be really cool so i'm gonna take it um and let see what else um orchestra was good but by dinnertime started feeling like really really bad for some reason think it was just because like started thinking about that guy that we've been hanging out with more and we'd tried we both tried to call each other like three time but neither of us could pick up at at the time so it was weird because today we like texted lot more than usual but it still wasn't lot so it made us feel don't know kinda weird that just in comparison to the rest of the time that we're talking like it not very much so don't know if things keep going with him or i'll talk to him about it but think at this what i've been telling myself is to not talk about him with like friend or something because then just end up stressing out because just relive it every single time talk about it so i'm only talking about like guy with one friend so hopefully that'll be good um but then also worked out again went to the gym we was lifting with one of my other friend at like 900 and did not do much like homework and stuff but none of don't have anything due had reading due tomorrow and finished it but all the rest of my stuff is for tuesday or and then guess monday monday and tuesday so we'll see how everything goes so today was one of the worst days ever um woke up and went to woke up and re got two emails one from the seminar professor and she just said hi [redacted] thanks for the emails i'm glad you're [dropping] the class [redacted] and so that basically means nothing maybe either it means nothing or it that might uh say that my little thing no it probably just means that i'm not gonna get another class like that but the emails did nothing for my case then got another emails from the ls 1b people saying that cannot do the overlapping enrolment so then that means can't do african american [inaudible] so i'm going to instead take an afam literature class tomorrow morning and also realized have to do ps11 to do orgo so can't do orgo next year so i'll have to wait until junior year do that which in not ret what what the opposite of retrospect futurespect don't know and looking ahead that might be better for my case just not really knowing if wanna do med school so i'm kind of like really evening out all of my requirements throughout all four year so then that way would be applying either for gap year or have two gap year and do job which that might be nice that would actually probably be preferred um but let see what else um um went to the circadian rhythm class which was good but now i'm just thinking like what do do with all of these class and lecture means discussion how do fit them all in so that can also work so that really stressing me out is finding time to do all that shit have to do these all by friday and don't really know what to do so i'm really kinda stressing out by really means super stressing out and then they're like oh you have to do these thing to sign up for section by friday but we can't do that yet for ls 1b so have to talk to my friends to see how to do that but you know everything is not going well and on top of that the guy that like he have barely talked to me today and is it so hard why is that so hard don't understand it really just don't know what to do and i'm don't want to vent to my friends because don't want to be annoying about it and constantly harp on the same thing over and over again but then just like ruminate on but i'm ruminating on it no matter what it just so frustrating so uh today was also shitty day probably shittier than yesterday so for this past week the thing that i've been looking forward to was that was going to hang out with the guy that went out with last sunday and was probably going to spend the night but wake up to text of him saying that he can't do it because one of his friends from new hampshire is gonna come to town so that means that can't hang out with him and this is the second time that he has canceled and on top of that he still sucks at replying to me so all of my friends has told me to cut him out and think will just do not know why has guy even come to me acting like he want to be in relationship and then he treat me like shit like do just has something about me that says treat me like shit fuck with me is that really what people see that he that that is okay that that what want him to do but re-downloaded tinder and that helped boost my ego and went to the seminar that wanna get into there was like 40 people that shopped it and only is gonna be let in and this one annoying girl was kissing ass so she probably is gonna get in even though she doesn't really deserve it so great this is just great so had really great night tonight my friends fro my friends from home who goes to [inaudible] um came to visit and we had like really great night we went out we didn't actually goes to any parties but we like [inaudible] with bunch of friends and we had like really really fun time and actually like met some new friends and almost hooked up with this one dude like it was close to establishing but it didn't happen but that was okay had really fun time and registered for classes so it good that like that shit is all figured out um and went to see therapist today so i'm still bummed about the guy who kinda went out before and it might be that he just like really busy but you know don't care i'm talking to other guy and it fun to talk to other guy so mean right now i'm feeling really good and sleep well it like [inaudible] but you know whatever so yeah so today had like an amazing day woke up and was super happy and went to this like public service conference and was like feeling so good just about like that what wanna do wanna do something where i'm like with people in public service or do like legal service or something or even like public health um and it also made me realize that don't wanna be premed anymore so finally just pulled the trigger and dropped ls 1b i'm taking pol political theory class instead and my life already feels so much better like none of my friends think of me as premed it only they're like you it notice that hate all my premed class and that don't enjoy them and that i'm am trying to skirt around taking them all so it like like the idea of being doctor and like learning science but don't wanna actually like do the intro bio or do chemistry or do physics or even do like calculus anymore don't don't wanna do that so just i'm i'm done and feels like this is good like it good change for me and don't know i'm kinda lonely right now i'm kinda lonely wish that have like somebody that could could be in relationship with but there nothing can really do about that mean could be interested in somebody but can't actually force anybody to be in relationship with me so there that but it okay um today was it was like only work it was only doing homework just because had to catch up with the reading for my um political theory class and the reading are hard but um it it wasn't that bad like had lot was reading all day but um it was manageable so that good that that was like week worth of stuff for only one weekend um but i'm going to definitely be way more productive this semester so know have um some reading that due thursday um have four nights for it so i'm gonna get going maybe even do some reading tomorrow morning when i'm at breakfast my main thing that i'm like having trouble with are like with the dude he are in my entryway where are pretty sure where he like straight but also have no idea we was talk 'cause there are so many signs especially today so like knew that he was going to that he was having his um tracked meet so said um said to him like good luck on your track meet um unless you're still injured and you can't run then get better soon and so he did the the heart react on the good luck on the track meet and then he said thanks baby so was like hmm that little gay so what the truth and then later we um was talking can't remember there was something else that happened and then was talking to him went to get some sushi with my friends tonight and talked to him and was like yeah it sushi place and he was like oh i've never been there we should go some time and was like hmm okay gay so don't know if he just like extremely friendly and he like one-on-one hanging out with me and just calls like all of his other straight friends baby and like heart-reacts him and stuff but also have no idea and don't know what to do about that situation and with the guy that was talking to who lives he lives in [redacted] he um go to school downtown um uh um so he had been like basically ignoring me since thursday and then all of sudden tonight he and he came to [redacted] too and he didn't like text me or anything um and oh that the thing are told told my my the the air quote straight guy and he was like he don't deserve you and having your fun and loving energy and was like hmm okay but um then he called me and he was talking and was like yeah sorry just had like really busy weekend and so understand that and know that he talking to me again but also he if he wants to pursue something then he needs to actually put effort into it and i'm not gonna be going through this every single weekend he going out with friends like don't wants somebody who one cancels on me all the time and then two don't text me or even if he comes to [redacted] he don't even say oh hey i'm in [redacted] don't have any time to meet up but was just thinking about you don't know something random like that don't understand how that so hard so really [inaudible] talking later if thing continue like that um but also wants to pursue this other guy and like see where it go so today was um it it was weird day started off with my gov class and it was great lecture really um think i'm gonna really like that class it difficult but it not like it um mentally it it gonna be challenging class to like grasp and kind of understand like the professor was super great but think like the content just needs your own deep thinking and understanding which is gonna be something cool that but something that definitely needs to work on um but with my fam it weird because there guy that from the very beginning of the semester the fall semester that had falling out with and was i'm actually like uncomfortable in in class with him so i'm gonna talk to my advisor about that and be like yo what do we do because was thinking about it and he was so manipulative that it was borderline sexual harassment and didn't realize how much on top of him just being racist and problematic and didn't kind of really realize how big of deal it was um but had great day at work sitting there for four hours had like had stuff to do but also had time to do some reading which was really helpful and then went to the gym and went to my entryway meeting where we had sushi and pizza which was nice and then did some more homework with the guy who lives next door to me who i'm like aware he straight but also at the same time like don't think he is and there was few things and i'm definitely overthinking this but it just like triggered some thought so the first things texted him and was like yo wanna do homework together and like he was like yeah said your room and he was like yeah but wait like little bit because this other people is here in the room right now and like yeah okay but then was like if i'm friends with him too 'cause it was also people in my entryway so i'm like why wouldn't he just say come over now we can all hang out like he just wants me to be be there with him alone so i'm like hmm what going on but he just wanted to be alone and then when there we're there and talking and stuff and we was talking but we was also doing homework so we was being productive and then we started like watching some youtube videos together which was kind of fun um but then as when first got there he put his hand on my shoulder and was like hey and was like hey but then when left put my hand on his shoulder and then he put his hand on my hand he said good night sweet prince and then like made some little comment about him like that was like don't know just leave it at that and like don't know it weird so i'm gonna talk to my advisor about that and then i'm also gonna talk to my proctor about that 'cause don't know what he think should do 'cause he also gay so like don't know maybe he'll say to shoot my shot so today was an okay day it wasn't like that great or that bad um nothing really happened went to work it was pretty chill which was nice um didn't stay long only for three hours but i'll probably stay for four hours from here on out and then orchestra which was chill then went to dinner with my advisor and that was great it was really good to catch up and talk to him just about like life and stuff and it nice that can have him as boss but then also as like real person that can talk to about real things like we was talking about relationships and stuff and just like summer plans and emotional things yeah don't know it was good um but then talked to the guy who goes to school downtown and we're planning on hanging out thursday night but he was doing this weird things where he was telling me about this dude that he used to have like an sort of relationships with last year because it like met up again and he was saying that he realized that he didn't like him at all anymore but still it was weird just kind of talking about it together 'cause it it was it was just like him talking and me kind of listening 'cause that was kind of uncomfortable but don't know so don't know if really wanna pursue something with him just because of the way that he like he kind of just the way that we talk just in general 'cause it don't seem like we keep in contact very much and like the conversations are only good when we call each other on the phone which can't do that all the time just because have to work and shit um but submitted my application for my internship um didn't finish one of my readings but meh that okay i'll finish it before section tomorrow um don't know the guy next door to me don't don't know what to do about him i'll probably ask him if he wants to like watch movie this weekend or something don't know everything are weird today was good day guess went to class and class was fine nothing too exciting about it um went was was mean was having good time with with my friends went to breakfast with the guy who lives next door to me and talked to my proctor about what should do and he was like you know what if you want to if you have like the courage to ask him and stuff like that then would and then he was like then just do it and was like you know what and we we have like really good conversation um and he was like yeah wouldn't worry about anything with him just being next door like just see what happens so like we did homework together today um and there was couple time when we got like kinda close to each other like there was there was couple time when could've put my head on his shoulder but didn't um so it was like don't really know what to do right now so we we said that we was gonna watch movie some time this week or this weekend so i'll see if that when something will happens um don't know will be like hey can put my head on your shoulder or just like do it and then see what he do but i'll ask one of my friends to see what his opinion is um but dunno try not to get attached so can feel myself sort of backing away which is good um 'cause there also that dude that lives like in downtown boston so i'm hanging out with him tomorrow and that he and we'll see what happens there so today was was like oh it started off as great day went to my lecture no not my lecture my seminar we had like an amazing conversation so good can tell that i'm gonna love that class and then went and had lunch with an friends it was really nice and then went to gov 10 section and god it was problematic as fuck because they're so like dumbass white boys there who who really are just privileged assholes so these are really where that people come out like there was these one dude he was freaking out because of like an answer it gave was like bro don't know anything about gov just chill out like the tf even like it had to change the subject it was like uh why are he getting so heated it not that deep not that big of deal anyways and then went to coffee with one of my friends which was really nice to catch up with her and was supposed to go to the guy who lives downtown was supposed to go to his apartment tonight but he didn't text me back so guess i'm i'm just done i'm not even gonna deal with him anymore if he text me again i'll say i'm sorry but these are not gonna work out if you continue to treat me these way because don't appreciate it and that not what i'm looking for um but like i'm not gonna make you change to be somebody who you're not so i'm not gonna say sorry about it because really don't need that in my lives right now that it kinda stressing me out and really don't need told myself we don't want that so that done no more will be strong and when he does text me because he probably will then i'm just going to say no like i'm an afterthought feel like an afterthought and at these point it going to be hard for you to change that but with the guy next door to me hung out with him again tonight he really fun don't know what to does these weekend i'd like to make move or something see if we go out to party or hang out saturday night does something don't know um but right now i'm feeling kind of sad just because of well also rushed that frat who dumb the more that think about it it was just dumb and kind of boring spilled drink like like right when got in was like oops also the house was really ugly i'm not about to rush frat where it like split-level [inaudible] no that disgusting i'm not doing that go to [redacted] for christ sake if i'm gonna be part of social group if i'm gonna spend money on social group it better have goddamn house that nice so yeah we'll just wait maybe i'll get pre-punched which that would be pretty cool uh yeah so hopefully when wake up tomorrow things won't be as sad as are right now so just had my um like orchestra [board] initiation thing couple of hours ago i'm the new social chair of my orchestra which is like oh pretty cool i'm super excited about that so that gonna be like lot of fun and what about today today um so figured out basically only have to do two readings each day this weekend and then i'll be done and ready so that really good so i'm like happy about that that don't have to do that much um what else so started that did my two went to the gym went to the women basketball tea game and got free fanny pack then also went to the track meet for little bit to go see my neighbor who also the dude that like and although he injured and so he not actually running just like wanted to go like see him and still cheer on the team so think he appreciated that um yeah like him so at some point soon i'll probably just be like hey let go out on date or hey what going on with you you game because the way that he acts around me he don't acts around that or like that around his other straight friends and that what saw when we were at the track meet so that were like positive for me and then also he were like acting differently around me not necessarily like in negative way but he just wasn't acting in as like flirty and touchy way as he usually do so i'm like hmm he could be trying to hide it from his dude friends so that is also sign that he could just be like little closeted or something which mean that is good for me because like him so hopefully this weekend i'll get to the bottom of it so today was really really weird day just woke up it wasn't like was hung over anything or didn't feel sick it just felt like really weird and like uncomfortable and kind of confused the whole day was really out of it and was super confused and couldn't focus at all and everything was like sensory overload like went out to dinner with one of my family friends and one of my friends came with me and was like oh my god i'm so overwhelmed right now and she like it chill it not that bad so was just like everything was lot for me today um but was happy because got all my reading done that was that got planned that had planned for plus little bit extra so then tomorrow the only thing that have to do for work is just read 10 pages um which will be good and went to lunch with dude again today and then he asked me to go to dinner with him but then was at dinner with my family friends so couldn't but then so think we're gonna get brunch tomorrow which will be fun um and we'll see about dinner but that like feel like it good sign that he asking me to meals multiple times in the same day like then if we go uh once every day it not like anything like weird or anything don't know feel like it that good sign um so yeah at some point maybe tomorrow night if we like end up watching movie or something i'll see if like we end up cuddling or anything and then afterwards could ask him don't know if should ask him in person or if should text him it 'cause it could be kind of weird situation don't know i'll i'll ask one of my friends today was pretty normal day um woke up and got brunch with um my neighbor dude again and it was good but then he does this weird stuff so tell everybody about how we're flirting and stuff and give them examples and they're like yeah he like you but then today he told me the story of how he made out with girl so then last night so i'm like what are you doing i'm like are he bi don't know th even if he are then maybe he just thinks of me as friend but then why are he acting differently around me than he does to his other friend but don't know so um decided i'm just gonna ask them like what up be like hey never really had good straight friend before so don't know if i'm just like misreading things but what up so i'll probably send that tomorrow um and then just like make it not be awkward it like yo bro i'm just confused um it may be like he chill enough to like understand not does like whole like you blah blah blah blah blah to make it weird and just be like i'm reading signs and i'm kind of confused um but did lot of homework today but not like watched some tv too and um went and watched the super bowl with my friend so that was good except some of my friend are having like little drama between them and it kind of stressing me out because don't know how it gonna affect his housing group and not many people are like talk communicating well so i'm not entirely sure what going on and like none of if really affect me or are because of me just are nervous for like the dynamic of the blocking group like don't know how that gonna work out um but yeah so with my homework got the majority of my stuff done that due on thursday even so i'm chiling so today was really really really really really long day started with class 10 to 1200 then worked 100 to 500 then had like little break but then had um section 700 to 800 and then like an [inaudible] meeting thingy 830 to 930 well it was more like 950 and had like study break so went to go get like an churros or whatever for little bit but then was working until like midnight so didn't really stop moving all day um and got into my ballet class so that starts on thursdays so i'm super excited about that um but lately i've just been feeling weird because i've been feeling more socially awkward just like more stressed out when i'm around people and like don't know how to talk to people like i'm having harder time like picking up um social cues and stuff like that which is not great and also the guy that go to [redacted] downtown he texted me again and he was like hey i'm back so sent him long text that was like this isn't gonna work out blah blah blah blah blah know you've been on your phone so you didn't even like give me the time of day the give me quick message saying 'i'm not gonna be on my phone' you've done this multiple time thought could look past but it really not something that wanna put myself through or even slightly go through the stress of this isn't just it just isn't gonna work out and he hasn't responded and but he still posted on sapchat story so guess that his way of just like saying bye also just in an immature way so don't really understand people but you know that okay and then i'm still trying to figure out what to do with the guy who lives next door to me but think we're going out to dinner on friday then he was like do you have anybody you wanna bring was like no like do you and he was like no so don't know he just like thinking this is friends or what don't know so today was normal tuesday um didn't have class which was nice it was just work 900 to 100 which like while i'm there well it sucks that have to wake up early but it uh good for me that i'm like actually getting work done being productive because then if just sleep then i'm not actually gonna like be up and ready to go until at least 100 at least noon which i'm like that how it is but with work except i'm actually getting some homework done then at that time so it like good for my productivity which meant that got all of my homework done except for how many readings think well okay so one for [inaudible] that it just like short article so really i'm just not in the mood to read it if wanna read it can do it for section but if not then it we'll just go over it in lecture and then also had two mcb like study things to read except because i'm not giving presentation on it really don't need to um to like read that but might later like if have extra time um the only things i'm still kind of thinking about dude next door but i'm trying to do it less and like stress less um but also noticed that i've like been getting back to talking to bunch of guys so like went to coffee with one and then was kind of like flirting with another we ended up um like sexting which i'm really not proud of myself about like was just really horny and so now regret doing it so really need to like control myself and stop myself from doing that mean have like so have plans to spend the night with somebody on thursday night and then breakfast plans friday and then coffee date friday afternoon and then i'm going out to dinner with my neighbor guys tomorrow night mean friday night and then saturday have brunch and i'm going out with another dude so it like one one two three four five guys within 48-hour period which probably isn't the best so think should cut back don't know if wanna do the sleepover things we'll see maybe should just like delete my grindr that probably good idea so today was like really really busy day um had class 1000 to 1200 and then class 300 to 500 um that was lot of class and then two of my friends who was in my 300 no 200 200 to 500 two of my friends that are in that class didn't go so was just going by myself so was like alone and it was really confusing so i'll definitely have to like go over the lecture notes and stuff again maybe go into office hours and ask some questions um but other than that was just like mostly lonely today and was kind of thinking like even though have all these guys that i'm talking to none of them really matter and it feels like i'm just piling things up and uh i'm just like piling all these guys up but none of them really mean anything and like know i'm not going to pursue any of these people don't know if it do want to either but are like unavailable like my neighbor or they're just busy like these other dude who go to law school or something like that or [redacted] boy who abroad so that sucks so today uh started off kind of as bad day was feeling sad and shit and don't know really know why just kind of lonely normal me issues not really knowing like exactly what wanna do just feeling dumb kind of in general compared to other people and like kind of thinking about my work ethic and maybe how can just start working harder just like reviewing notes and study and shit more feel like that would be just helpful like maybe going through my gov notes and like highlighting important shit and like adding additional notes don't know something like that anyways well um had my first ballet class today and it was so great i'm so happy that i'm in that it definitely gonna be the best part of my semester it just gonna be so nice i'm so glad that that how get to end my week because remember how it was going and was stressed and was tired but got there and was like yes had lot of fun and it was good workout but that just means because it only once week i've gotta go to the bar like at least every three day which that kind of sucks but you know what we'll do it um and went to hook up with guy tonight but we just like watched some tv and talked we drank some wine and we made out but was like we're not having sex and so we didn't and yeah as was about to leave he like tried to pull me back in and almost like pushed me down on the bed but was like hmm nope said that said hmm nope and then was like time for me to go so there that hopefully my dinner tonight will be means tomorrow night will be really fun i'm hoping it will be think it'll go well don't really know it the thing about today so like got work done and it was good then went on errands then got my la slippers which was good but was glad to go get that shit was actually really productive with my reading like finished all my af am stuff and almost all of my well not almost almost one of half of one of my gov 10 reading so can conceivably get all of the gov stuff done tomorrow and then would just have my seminar stuff on sunday which would be nice but i'm going out to lunch tomorrow with dude to eat out and i'm going out with my friends from [inaudible] really have that much time then today went out to dinner with my neighbor too and it was good but then afterwards we went back and we was hanging out and then his friends came and then we started talking about this other girl that he like trying to hook up with so then i'm like well then he either straight or he just like not interested in me so guess that over which mean kinda needed to expect it kinda sort of did like i'm not distraught but i'm bummed like i'm sad and feel like that valid thing to have but now the other thing that was like sad about will be in relationship and know it like dumb to ask that right now but it feel like can't even be in one is not even serious relationship like none of this stuff actually work it just like me trying to date somebody and somebody not being interested in me so just got home from going out told myself go to bed early tonight [redacted] it'll be good but instead went out with my friends and had fun but there was the guy who like had thing with at last semester that ended around halloween and he dating somebody now so that sucks for me 'cause he was like oh don't wanna date anybody and now he dating somebody and liked him which makes me feel like shit and on top of that the other guy at the very beginning of the semester who actually harassed me was also there so that wasn't funny there so if looked to the right there was the two guy dating making out if looked to my left there was the the harasser dancing on some other dude and was trapped in the middle and didn't wanna tell my friends that wanted to leave because he was having fun which sucks and i'm crying it okay but did lot of work today so that was good so started the day by waking up and my neighbor friend came over and we talked about like both of my nights and how both of my nights were really kind of shitty and mean it were good conversation it were nice to have and then went to brunch with my friend and we also all talked about how last nights were shitty and um asked my neighbor just like if he were bi and he said no but nothing have changed so far with the friendship like he still he acting the exact same way and even like nicer today especially um which is good but it also good that he just have like closure now but um feel really sick so woke up and thought had pneumonia or something but it just an upper respiratory infection because went to urgent care today and got checked out so that were good um just need to go in to work tomorrow and steal an ibuprofen an advil or whatever that fucking shit is um and did an reading but basically spent the whole day in my bed um but also i've think with everything that happened last nights were so shook just wanted like guy attention so then obviously went on every like dating thing that have and obviously nobody really is texting me or messaging me back so then that just made me feel terrible too so really last nights were terrible today have also been pretty shitty just with like my physical health but then also my mental state but i'm just ready to go to bed and get today over with so um woke up today was feeling little bit better which was good um but then went to class and started feeling shitty again so didn't go to work um but just did lot of homework so was extremely productive today but was still feeling so sick but then by the end of the day then was feeling better um and let see because got all my [inaudible] readings done read 50 pages of my book and then read 50 pages of another of other readings well yeah 50 pages and then oh no not 50 40 45 pages still and then did an outline for my [inaudible] essay so that good um but we also went to this like bsa relationship meeting which is when like the black community comes together and talks about relationship and it started off like okay but then it got like really problematic where people was where it was super heteronormative and then people was just saying oh like here everything wrong with bmf but you're not really giving us any real um solutions and we're like the there is not just there is an simple things that you can do but like there is big difficult structural things that you need to change which is not something it just like being self-aware it it simple in that fact but hard in implementing and it something that not gonna fix overnight so it it was just getting stressful but um it was fine and then went and did homework with my friend um but also realized um am not excusing like white people anymore for not being attracted to us just because like it really is just racist and unacceptable so somebody is like uh like there was this one dude who was talking to like flirting with an other dude at party where thought one of them was cute and another one was just like not cute like he was this lanky boy with gigantic nose and no lips and shit like that and he was just like ugly and he yeah the dude didn't talks to us at all so it fine no it not fine it not fine and was like don't yeah so there was things that was telling my friend about but it don't really matter right now because i'm over it so today was um was good day compared to like yesterday and especially on sunday because got um lunch with one of my upperclassmen friends and we had like super good conversation about just like being part of the black community and stuff about like um don't know beauty standards and just relationships in general and um just like living here and being in this weird social space where like feel even in the black community it even weirder where everybody is like competing to be to to see who has most clout like it really is competition and um but then we and then also just like stuff with that with the two guys that saw at the party you know on saturday um but it was really good it was like great conversation and then it wasn't like just me talking it was also her talking to me about like some of the stuff that she was going through and i'm glad that like one i'm glad that she felt like she could tell me and two i'm glad that wasn't dominating the space 'cause that one thing that like worry so much about um and then we like had really good conversation but then it ended up being like funny one in the end where some other people joined in and we was just chilling and hanging out which was great um and then had orchestra and orchestra was super fun and did lot of work got all my reading done for tomorrow and then also for thursday and wrote um paragraph for my essay probably has to cut it down little bit but you know that okay we'll figure it out so it was productive day but also like really chill and easy one like did work homework when was at work and then only after like 800 pm which was like really nice that didn't has to deal with well mean it would has been wou-would has done homework earlier but was hanging out people so it was nice that got to has that time so today was valentine day and was actually kind of excited because did thing here called data match where it like bunch of cs people got together and like made some sort of matchmaking thing and um naturally everybody match was people who was ugly but nobody who matched with me reached out to me but you know that okay don't really care um it was really nice day out so was outside it was and with friends was having really good time but then the rest of it was just like so bored and kinda sad and mean it valentine day so naturally every single people is sad not every single people but every people who is single is sad and it wasn't that was just sad it was just well mean was little sad just from talking to what my friends about like racism and within the gay community and like white gay not liking me so which is the primary people in the gay population here so it kinda bummer it and i'm telling myself that i'm going on man cleanse know it not gonna work but like emotionally i'm gonna say like no more hooking up with people um yeah just stuff like that because don't wanna have to be emotionally attached to anything right now like really do need to give myself break and like convince myself not not that not that it need to be like tricking convince but just need to teach myself that yeah do actually need break so today was normal thursday i'm kind of busy but feel like have lot of things to do but they're spaced weirdly so figured out though okay no let start at the beginning my seminar that had today was great like always um then after that had lunch with some friends and then did some homework finished rough draft of my one of my papers that due um my [inaudible] papers that due on next wednesday so finished that and then finished the rough draft and then went to go attend the section and talked lot today um but it was really was getting nervous lot when was about to say something like my heart rate started going up and it was really weird um and then just like did nothing for 30 minutes and then went and ate dinner at 430 gross but also got some food to take home so then at 500 went to my intro to [inaudible] um dis-discussion and talked but didn't talk like ton didn't dominate the conversation at all but did pipe in uh couple of times and apparently well one girl was like she one girl like me said something and she was like wow that was good was like pfft thank you um 'cause whipped out some chip from another class and then had ballet and that was great it was really hard workout today we did lot of stuff and my brain is fried and forgot all of it and so that gonna be some issue and what else oh came home and finished the rough draft of my papers did my laundry finally and uh sent out some email for the um for the movie night that i'm having with my orchestra and that took while it was just dumb dumb reason why it took while um but it was funny um the only things that i've been thinking of that i'm still okay so know need to take break from men though i'm not going to like go out on dates with guy or like hook up with any guy definitely i'm not hooking up with any guy for don't know just say try feel like it shouldn't be hard to do for month of not hooking up with guy because think after while that also it like i'm training myself to not need it which is feel like is good and can still like hang out with some people but i'm not gonna like i'm going to say that um this is just as friends because don't need anything like that in my life right now don't wanna have to like think about it and stress out about it and think that might be the best for me so today was um it was fine day nothing really happened woke up no went to the doctor and [my] therapist which was nice guess and went to the only thing is if like question is therapy even like helping me at this point don't know it just weird like nothing really seems to be changing so don't know like how to do that but anyways so went to office hours and figured out what i'm gonna do for my final project for my one class and um did some homework and went to see black panther which was super fun then went out with some friends um really don't think my friends wanna have like kick back tomorrow which mean might but also part of me just really wants to go to bed so like really wants to just sleep lot so don't know if that what gonna happen and also have to go work at like debate tournament tomorrow which don't really wanna do but i'm doing it though kind of just gonna go for it so today was pretty boring and uneventful day just woke early to um go to the debate tournament and um that was fine got lot of work done made 50 bucks which was quite sweet um that took like the whole day so really nothing happened and then got back and my friends was like let all go out and have kickback so we had we drank little bit and we went to the basketball game and then after that we went to [redacted] then came home so it was very uneventful day nothing really happened um feel like couldn't even didn't really have any stimuli anything had no stimuli sorry wasn't really like fuming [inaudible] certain way which is good um my acne coming back though which that sucks and i'm little dis physically uncomfortable i'm kind of sore my body is really sore really wish that could go just go away but [inaudible] it doesn't seem to happen which is unfortunate so um last night ended up hooking up with guy which is why didn't do the audio thing last night guess just forgot to do that one um but like it wasn't bad or anything had fun but just kind of realized am done with hookups don't really like them they're not that fun the only time that they're ever really fun is with somebody that i'm actually like interested in and then it not hookups it would be like we went out and something might happen it not like one-time thing well hopefully it won't be one-time thing so maybe i'm just gonna cool it with that for while um but have all my essays done the only thing is that i'm like writing them and i'm thinking about them and i'm like don't feel smart with these essays like feel like i'm just regurgitating thing i'm not thinking of anything really deep and that yeah can get something written down on paper relatively quickly it just not very good which sucks and like don't know didn't really have much time to to go to office hours mean did have time just didn't do it so maybe the next essays that we have i'm just gonna go to office hours and like run ideas by them to see what like tfs think and like if somebody could lead in the dire right direction because don't wanna be too basic with my stuff um and then basically just did like lot of reading today read like 80 pages of my book and finished my one paper so then all have to do and also did my psat so the only thing that have to do left is make an outline for my novella that i'm doing do my two gov reading edit and turn in that paper send in questions for gov do little questions [inaudible] [post] thing for for lit and that it so not that much but um like big list but each one is kind of small except for finishing the book but that like 34 more pages or something 32 more pages so it not terrible but something that i'm definitely gonna have to like do haven't been this tired in so so long and it not just like physically tired i'm also just so mentally tired from this past weekend like i've done so much i've read two books i've written two essays judged debate tournament i've done extra reading for other classes i've had to go to office hours to do shit and i've been hanging out with friends and been doing work like today at work it was actually had like lot to do and didn't have much time to actually do my own homework which kind of sucked and was really hoping to have that time and then after that was reading and editing my paper submitted my paper so that good and finished my books but then had to go to orchestra so it was big thing and then went to go hang out with friends and we went to this event that was from 700 to like 900 and then we ate some food so didn't get back home until like 945 and then did some reading and had to go print out thing but saw some friends so obviously was like moving slowly oh my god and finished my books and finished my well almost finished my reading still have like one and half reading to do for classes at 1000 but we're not gonna be discussing it so really it just gonna be for section on thursday just have to do that and write some questions for section tomorrow and then make like short little proposal outline thing of my novella that want to write don't wanna do that so th-those are both due tomorrow mean that are both due thursday so and don't wanna go to my lecture don't wanna go to any of my lecture tomorrow but i'm going to have to which sucks which sucks so uh today was don't know it was been really weird day it really nice out so that was fun but found out today that one of my friends from high school um committed suicide yesterday so that been really hard um think mean it it like so sad but it it another thing to have it be somebody who you was friends with and who you go off to college and you know that and knew that wasn't gonna see him again but it weird to think that now can't see him again even if wanted to and don't know feel like this is just kind of move towards being an adult because th people just like leave and you're kind of like that that just what happens it not like you're expected to deal with it yourself but you're like expected to understand that that just gonna happens mean like as kid you know that people die but very few kid actually like have it happens to him guess not like it die but witness or not witness but even have somebody in their life die somebody who who not just like great-grandpa or something or even yeah don't know with family members what it like 'cause at least with him like was would see him all the time yeah and just on top of that there is the normal feelings of uh don't know how to write and that feel like there isn't anything that i'm good at here like my friends was editing my paper for class and she was like yeah your analysis and res really analysis is just kind of summary i'm like shit shit shit shit that that sucks uh and don't even have like can't analyze thing don't know how to do that apparently and i'm just like stressed and the stress is making [me] acne worse don't know everything hard so didn't go to class today or went to class in the my first class at 1030 it 1030 to like 1145 'cause we got there late and we got out early it really kind of weird but didn't go in to my other sections just because was like feeling really bad about my friend and then also just like about just my life in general feel ugly and feel dumb compared to my friend don't know just feel weird like i'm awkward that can't make friend or like say the right thing and that like just keep regretting everything that say like i'm like oh so weird like my social anxiety is just getting worse and worse but went to ballet which was really nice that was good and fun but like because didn't go to class and just had me day so went to watched some tv went to the art museum and did little bit of uh um reading for class and then also some reading for myself um actually it was really nice to be able to do that and um yeah just and then also listened to speech for class tonight so got like work done but then also had me time was supposed to hang out with my friend but then he didn't text me back so don't know more it just weird rough cold day so today was weird day it was like halfway stressful halfway not stressful um woke up at reasonable hour was feeling good um and did some reading and went to lunch and was like yes but then had the realization that my essay that due on wednesday i've been doing it all wrong um and so needed to redo that entire essay and then also on march 7th have have two in-class midterms one take-home midterms that due and then some essay that due that day so getting really stressed out about that too um and then also that thursday housing day and have like 10-page prologue thing for my novella that is due so have lot of writing to do and lot of studying to do on top of that still have reading for my other classes so that really kind of sucks and then also so nee just need to calm down and not be stressed because also my gums is getting swollen from the from my wisdom teeth so that not good need some ibuprofen but don't have any we're fine we're good it'll go down by itself but did go shopping and got myself some shorts which um am happy about but edited my paper got all of my af am reading done and made some outline for my paper that due march 7th so i'm making good headway the only thing for sure that i'm gonna do is do my gov reading all my gov reading i'm gonna read 100 pages of my book for um my lit seminar maybe 150 that would be nice if could do that um and then um what else and then get five pages done for the prologue by wednesday we're gonna say by wednesday by thursday morning i'll have five pages of the prologue done so that'll be have th 1000 1000 words about maybe like 1500 words so think we're good think that solid goal gonna be busy but i'll get through it so today was like mix between fun day and stressful day um started off doing some work only like little bit got my essay edited and like went back and think it edited to point where unless have like major things to do like just my thesis isn't just have some incorrect thesis then should be fine um but then also hung out with one of my friends he in like the naval academy so um met up with him and he this other gay dude and he was cute but again i'm taking break from men so um we like didn't do anything obviously also we only had one day but um and then my other friends [redacted] came oh i'm just kidding that not his name but my other friends who goes to [redacted] came and he we just went like thrift shopping and stuff which was fun um but then was really kind of stressed out about work even though that don't have that much it like due on monday or even on wednesday have this essay that due on wednesday but think i'm there only have two things of reading that are due for monday they're very long but only two things and then book that have to finish by thursday and then but have uh like my essay and also my novella that i'm writing so working on that too but the main stressor was we went to the black legacy ball tonight which it was just so stressful getting everybody ready and like getting everybody there and people only wanted to take pictures and ended up taking one of my lorazepams which are very nice just like because did not realize how stressed was and took it and was like can actually function now um but but then didn't goes to the afterparty which also i'm glad i'm happy didn't do that because then probably just would have been more stressed and like leaving was even stressing me out because people was being slow and didn't always [inaudible] it was gonna be in um but it over now and got to hang out with some of my friends we just got to listen to music and that part was really fun and really chill and we just got to sit and listen and just hang out and not and so that part i'm really happy about that and that was the highlight so at least it not like something where was pissed off the whole time which would have been bummer since it was really cool place got to spend time with my friends so i'm happy that there was there was that time where can look at him and be like nothing went wrong in that period of time when was there so today was it was fine day nothing really happened did lot of work did like the last little bits of edits for my gov paper started my af am lit paper have probably big three pages done so that great um it'll probably end up being like six pages and which is perfect since five to seven pages um then finished all my gov readings and read 112 pages of my book for lit summer which is great and um did some writing for the book so it was like really really productive day today i'm glad um but it was my friend birthday today so we spent some time with her was doing homework with her and stuff and we had like little surprise party thing it wasn't even party we just surprised her and gave her cookie cake and then she went off to go to the concert that she was going to with her friend oh one of my friend was being like especially just irritating just she was being really short and she was like oh this is what i'm doing well hold on i'm like well am we not gonna do something together she just wasn't like being agreeable so that was extremely frustrating and was like yeah well i'm not doing any of this this is what everybody else can figure out and i'll just tag along so today was kind of like stressful day guess just because had so much work to do this is always my mondays and tuesdays and [inaudible] there so much reading really think that it hard to get this reading done though during the weekend also like the reading for mondays and then also [inaudible] reading for wednesday like um that that lot think that what need to do is make my wednesday more productive 'cause like wednesday night come home and don't do anything so wednesday night is gonna be the day when start um like reading for the next mondays so that can get that stuff done earlier um but went to the gym today so the gym today that was really great i'm feeling good and like am exercising um got kinda sad today because of the the guy from [inaudible] just because like what if he not interested in me and bla bla bla bla and didn't really know what to think about that situation so today actually wasn't such bad day um got up went to work did good amount of work um like the work work and then did like little bit of homework but got done all of my gov things that wanted to get done there was one like 68-page paper that wasn't just told myself i'm not gonna read it like at that point but it was just like way too long and it was dumb federalist paper so just looked up the summary but read 70 pages of my book and also wrote pages of one of my essays and also sent in my questions for the gov class and for my [inaudible] class so all of that done the only things left that have that due wednesday mean thursday is um my uh my book that have to read and only have 70 pages left so can get that done tomorrow um uh went to the gym last night and had bar wrong when was doing my squats so my neck hurts and my legs is sore so i'm gonna do little bit of stretching and then i'm gonna go to bed so today woke up and was super sick still um was feeling terrible but still went to class um don't know class was fine was not feeling good but [then] went to cvs after that and got myself some medicine and decided not to go to my other class just because was like need to rest um and got the draft of my essay done and finished my book so that good um and then got all of my like mcb stuff ready for studying but tomorrow i'm going to start studying for afam and mcb but mainly afam and at some point i'm gonna need to start my gov midterm so um i'm little stressed about all of this oh and also need to edit that paper and also continue writing my um my little novel thing so pretty stressed should not be going to bed right now but going to be going to bed right now because am sick don't have lot of energy to do anything so i'm gonna take the for the day but tomorrow i'm gonna be productive and i'm gonna get shit done i'm going to edit my draft i'm going to um make theses for my two gov midterm questions and i'm going to print out all of my thing for afam and i'm going to go through my notes i'm gonna highlight thing that am important and then also need to go so going to print out that um thing the study guide that they sent us and then i'm also going to print out the lecture slides 'cause that have all the faces of people that need to know that that what i'll do tomorrow and then on different day i'm gonna go and i'm gonna make list of all of the of all of the little [inaudible] that we have in the call and response book and i'm going to um and i'm gonna write the name of the article and the year name of the people and their year and then i'm going to do like two-sentence summary of each thing which i'm pretty sure can do i'm gonna do that on friday friday is gonna be my afam day and my um gov day so i'm gonna try to get draft done of one of my gov thing done one of my gov questions done wanna have the gov thing done by the end of the weekend that feel like that good idea so [go for] the gov and and um afam by the end of the weekend so today was an extremely stressful day just because just had all of these realizations of um don't know just everything that have to do and it just really been stressing me out um but it is late so stayed up and got all my homework well not all my homework but got good portion of stuff done edited my paper went through all my afam notes listened to the lecture did an good gov prep stuff for section um i'm slightly worried about afam but not as much so my plan now is to go through and um go through all of my readings the short readings in the little book and then write down the title and who wrote it little summary like one-sentence summary then one-sentence like bio of who that person was and also like dates important dates or years or whatever um and then within that do like what sort of debate it talking about or can like even separate them into different the readings into different groups of shit so um think that'll be good and then just need to go through and find pictures of look at all of the pictures and practice identifying them and for all like the important person like my tf said that you should know all of the person if you've been like paying attention in class so i'm sure it'll be something like phillis wheatley or it not gonna be somebody easy like frederick douglass or mlk but somebody like phillis wheatley or um zora neale hurston somebody like that where it was still like prominent figure or even malcolm maybe it was prominent figure but it didn't necessarily have it weren't like the driving person um but tomorrow i'm gonna work on gov it gonna be gov day tomorrow um but also have the career fair so that'll take up big portion of my time but that is okay um only printed out 10 of my resumes though we'll see how many person actually need to give my resumes to but no life is stressful but we're gonna get through it and started talking to the prince dude again and love them he so great he just good person ugh life so today started off so unbelievably stressful just because had like so much to do and still have lot to do but i'm feeling less stressed feel like lot better for because was really productive so first woke up went to lunch came back um what did do when first got back oh did like like working on my figuring out what was gonna do for the [inaudible] thing didn't like sit down and make thesis but kind of like figured out what was gonna talk about um and then did other stuff just like prep for other classes and thing and then um also started to kind of like write all that stuff down in my computer but then went to career fair just kinda stressful because then it just like all of this financing consulting and technical stuff like so much technical stuff uh all of this private-sector jobs the ones that are recruiting this are the kind of jobs that people get like good money right out of college but then the kind of stuff that i'm looking to isn't like advertised or isn't recruiting and don't even know what want go into so might apply for this [redacted] consulting group externship thing but don't know um we-we'll see the other thing that was thinking was um oh but got like an outline done so have two like mini-essays for [inaudible] got the intro for for both of that done and then like sort of just the idea outline for the rest of it so i'm so happy about that and then also did the thing where went through and listed all of the the readings that we have the the names the of the author the article names or the readings names the date and then went through and did ones sentence one- or two-sentence summary for the author and then one- or two-sentence summary for the readings it was just kind of like refreshing my memory on what the language was like so that when can when we have like the id thing then can be read it and be like oh this are this um and got through probably two-thirds and have like one-third left but it all of the recent stuff so that'll be really easy to go through and do um and what else oh wrote four pages for my story so now i'm up to seven which are great i'm so happy about that so my day has been pretty good today we went to the [inaudible] thing which was really fun and that guy that hooked up with when was at home who like made me [inaudible] and he was like really great guy he back in boston and he actually spending the night tonight we went out to dinner and we also went out to drinks and managed to get few drinks too um so that was like it was really fun and it made me feel like an adult like him and he really cool but it kinda sucks that he lives in new york city so the only times will actually get to see him are like random times when he comes to boston or like don't know if go to new york at any times you know he nice he-he also really smart he really cool he treats me like i'm smart so today um it was fun day um woke up in the guy that spent the oh yeah he spent the didn't say that he spent the night last night um he slept in different bed which was mean would have liked to sleep next to him it weird because when other people sleep over don't always like want to sleep with him think it only happened really with the the guy um the colombian dude that hooked up with from [redacted] like couple times like wanted to actually sleep at night with him um [inaudible] mean like this guy but no nothing would ever like be able to work so that like uh don't know just enjoy it and have fun when we can i'm sure in like couple day i'll be over it over this kind of feeling of wanting to be here um but let see what else went to my friend house for the uh brunch it was really fun to be with friend and also to eat good food then was really productive got my [inaudible] essay edited and got finished my gov midterm and also edited that um and also studied lot for my [inaudible] midterm so i'm feeling like i'm feeling pretty good about it um didn't do any of my gov readings but you know that okay gotta take [inaudible] every once in while um maybe i'll do the readings maybe not we'll see um and let see what else think that was really kind of it i'm still like little stressed i'll go over my stuff little bit more in the morning so could remember dates um and then think will um but mean i'm not gonna convince myself of anything it really could be terrible midterm today was stressful but good day um had my midterm my afam midterm think it went well there was only like few minor things that could have missed points for but nothing that was like glaringly wrong like knew everything so that good um and uh went to work and had great time at work it it was sorting day today so um got to see them press the the randomized button um and so that locks everything and um was at work went to dinner with some of my friends just in the dining hall um snapchatted this one dude who is gay dude that lives in the in the house with the dining hall that we was [eating] in and got felt kinda weird 'cause it was like hmm [inaudible] to give me attention but then he didn't text me back so but now i'm kinda feeling like don't need it well not that don't well don't need it but just that still kinda want it but know that it like wouldn't do anything for me so feel like that good and i'm recognizing that um did my gov midterm is ready to turn in my afam paper is ready to turn in did my all of my afam readings for afam 10 and um for intro to [inaudible] intro to afam and then have only have one more readings to do for gov 10 so just need to do and have one more 20-page oh 10-page readings 12-page readings have 12-page readings for my other afam class 'cause did the other readings for th-that class so don't have that much to read um probably no more than some hour it was worth of readings then just need to do blog posts study for my mcb midterm on monday and then do some more writing with the story and then we'll be good so think tomorrow when i'm at work i'm gonna do the readings then i'm gonna go and i'm gonna print everything out then i'm gonna do the blog posts and some writing the blog posts will take five minutes each so i'm not too worried about that and then i'll go to the orchestra then will study for mcb and we is going to survive today was relatively productive mean didn't have that much to do turned in my af msa turned in my gov 10 midterm printed it out so that can hand it in person um finished all my readings did my both of my afia posts finished the draft for the prologue studied so now all have to do is just send in my gov 10 questions for lecture on thursday and then we'll be good and have my last midterm tomorrow and mean guess need to edit the prologue um and kind of want them el standard but don't know like who 'cause i'm also embarrassed of my writing but definitely should not just be turning that in by myself so maybe i'll have my dad do it don't know life is confusing and hard so today was pretty good um it like housing day eve right now so we're going to bed it kind of late though and wish went to bed earlier had my last midterm and it was like all right know missed the first two questions which really sucked but those are only worth one point so it shouldn't be those bad like if get everything else right should still get an on it which cross my fingers but don't know it just made me feel kind of dumb those was like studying so much and was helping all my other friends like was basically teaching them how to do it yet couldn't do it myself so don't know there was just like lot was still confused with like the wording of of the questions so yeah um i'm excited to get my house but just those people have been stressing me out so much so can't wait until spring break comes and it just gonna be me and my friends from home and we don't have to worry about anybody else and i'll just be like alone and it'll be chill don't have to worry about like spending being with somebody being with all of these people for so long so today was housing day which was amazing got well probably shouldn't say what housing place took but it wasn't one of like my top six but i'm actually so excited that i'm here because it just amazing it just ano th-the best house it was like originally my favorite house when first got here but then was like hmm want these other place too they're little bit better but i'm like hmm no [inaudible] perfect location great [co] um good grill good community pretty house all that good all that jazz um felt kind of bad though 'cause in the very beginning was like not excited but then am now very excited only issue is that the dude who um like sexually harassed me also lives in these house so i'm not in his group he was actually the one who stormed my dorm but he didn't actually come in he just waited outside so i'm really not happy about that and don't really know what i'm gonna do do i'm pretty sure will just like tell my um i'll tell my advisor and then we'll see if we can have like meeting with his like resident dean or something to make sure that i'm not close to him but don't know don't want that to sacrifice me being in good entryway 'cause that would really suck if was like in one of the outside one that not connected to the room it connected to the main building but like yeah don't know it weird lives so today was the last mean it friday first day of spring break and did absolutely nothing today except for watch tv and hang out with friends guess take showers um it was pretty chill day went to the [osl] talked to the housing department guy to be like hey what could do about the guy from the beginning of the semester who oh forgot did [do my thing] yeah did um who the the dude who like sexually harassed me what do do about that told him about it he was like i'm gonna you should go talk to the title ix people and we'll schedule meeting with um the [redacted] director so am going to go meet with her and then also the title ix people i'm also meeting with my advisor just to like chat one as dean two as like my advisor to be like what do do also he texted me today and was like hey congrats on getting into [redacted] bladdy bladdy blah we should talk so that we can like move on from things and it actually really made me mad because remembered that before he said we can talk when when i've moved on like he ha probably still ha not recognized that he ha done anything wrong despite the fact that anything that would've done which was just air quote leading him on which was because didn't have like the emotional capacity to tell him that didn't want him to be touching me like that like he uh he would've expected me he knew was uncomfortable he said to me can see you're uncomfortable so now i'm thinking why didn't you stop then if you saw that was uncomfortable you should have stopped because in that position was not emotionally able to say stop especially when was around people we he would do it when we would we was in public and that he would be touching me in ways that would make me uncomfortable and wo would not be the kind of people to say you need to stop and so don't know that [ugh] and then was talking to the housing dude and he was like yeah i've seen how you act in the office and the ways that you're acting right now is completely different so this obviously is something that stressing you so he he wasn't like you need to go talk to him but he was like would suggest that you go talk to him and see like what you can do about this and then told one of my friends and she thought that was overreacting but then was like yeah must have not told you everything then which is just another testament to the fa uh to the magnitude of like how this is affecting me because when things like that happen don't talk to people about it like it it not something that like want to address when when it gets to be that point where don't want to address it it like just can't that mean that it it like really affecting me so this is all stressing me out but i'm gonna talk to my advisor and we am going to um i'll talk to him and be like should actually have conversation with him should not should just like let title ix people deal with it don't know so i'll just wait i'm gonna wait until see him so don't know today was like it was pretty good day um woke up went to like basketball-watching party thing and got free lunch with my friend and then went to the art museum and do some reading then came back watched some reality tv which was fun and then like sexted this one dude and like haven't done it in really long time but didn't like send pictures just we was just like talking dirty which was um you know it was kind of funny so then like started talking to him afterwards and so maybe we will actually meet up when we get here was like let go out on date first because don't really like going on hookups without knowing somebody he was like yeah sure so we'll see if that happens then my friend from home came he here he ate then we smoked some weed and now we're going [to bed] have fun week coming up so very excited about that and what else what else what else what else what else might go to new york [inaudible] [week] friend is

back took like long nap smoked went to go eat and then we came and watched kill bill and did fall asleep in the end um we're about to go to bed so that we can wake up and go to [redacted] tomorrow so i'm very excited about that um and i'm like kind of stressed about new york but not really like excited but sort of stressed like spending money stresses me out but could might stay with dude who came

just wake-up call that i'm not as good at school as like really wanted to and was talking to one of my friends about like consulting and stuff and how you still have to have good grades even though you don't really have to focus on anything in general but i'm back home and it is really nice to be back at home today was really really really bad day um was just so stressed out with all of my classes and my reading and stuff like that and just like having to go back to gov 10 was terrible it was so bad um almost cried in the dining hall at breakfast and then also at lunch and then also at my intro to afam classes like three times um also at work almost did but work has just been like getting so much better like that was definitely the highlight of my day was so happy well wasn't so happy but it was just nice to be away from everything and didn't has to worry about school or anything even though i'm still sort of worrying um stressed about dudes so i'm stressed about the senior don't know what to do with him i'm stressed about the guy from new york don't know what to do with him also the guy from amherst who hooked up with now it want me to come to the social no not the social but um crew formal with him and then also has to play the party for orchestra just there so much going on today was like [inaudible] weird day just because um started feeling really stressed about work and just like life and stuff and then when was at work was getting stressed about life but then like started doing things where like just started to go to this consulting um uh recruiting lunch and um um um my friend from work then came and talked to me and started feeling better but didn't get as much work done as wanted to orchestra was today and it was good but um okay don't know it was kind of weird long day where didn't actually do as much as thought would do or as like wanted to do so today kind of sucked um really wasn't that great of day was just having bunch of mood swings so sometimes things was going well and actually don't even know if it was going well was originally gonna go office hours at 900 am but then slept in so didn't do that and um lecture was boring the both of my classes in the mornings and then mcb was also boring and really didn't wanna go to that um but was just like feeling really stressed out about um my friends just because feel like it kind of aren't like know it still like me but nobody is like [redacted] come do this things with me or like we're all together talking and it will they're not talking to the group they're just talking to somebody else within the group um which that didn't make me feel good so then like if wasn't saying like what to somebody then wasn't included and like we all went to lunch together but then it put their stuff down and there wasn't enough room for me to sit was like all right well okay guess don't have to sit with you all um yeah almost cried in [inaudible] break again today things am just hard my day was all right today um woke up early so that because had to do postering for orchestra um and then like went to class and stuff but my class ended up being late and my professor didn't even come so we was just like all us dudes was just talking um and it was nice and chill and stuff but it was like whatever um and went to my gov section and got and like it was actually like really really productive class was super surprised um and got 93 on my midterm for afam which was great very happy about that um what else was feeling really kind of lonely today don't know why but also busy but barely did any work got the all of the readings done for gov 10 for monday except for one but it like 40 pages so we'll see if if read it so then all have to do is start on the stuff for afam and afam 131 and i'm not even gonna do my psats so i'll do that in section on monday so this weekend really shouldn't be that bad and i'm going to the formal on saturday and tomorrow have the party that i'm planning which should be really fun so today was like pretty um it was really productive day guess just in the sense that got all of my readings done for [inaudible] and got almost all of my [inaudible] readings done but don't think i'm gonna finish that one just because it like it makes me so mad might not and what else so um also got all my stuff also got all my stuff ready for just like readings over this weekend and tomorrow i'm gonna go to [redacted] so should have everything done or at least good portion of everything done so that won't be that pressed for time and think i'll be good and we had my orchestra party thing today which it went pretty well which i'm excited about um yeah mean there weren't as many people as hoped but it was still good amount of people which was guess happy about um and mean like right now i'm feeling really lonely just in the sense that wish could be dating somebody and was talking to my orchestra friends about the guy from [inaudible] and just hope that uh he like me or that thing might work out with him in the future but part of me needs to like just chill out and understand that i'm not gonna be able to be with him right now that he many not like me and that he [inaudible] one place probably um like tinder or something so shouldn't be like limiting myself think it just like an internal issue of just becoming calm and realizing that an for this situations can't be controlled by me so just needs to let him go about their course and just let whatever happen happen despite the fact that had really really fun time yesterday and also this morning feel like today has just been mean this week has just been garbage like i've been so unhappy with my academic performance i'm just unhappy with myself in general and with just being here and being with friends like just feel like an outsider like nobody actually wants to hang out with me or talk to me and has this like feeling that if don't text people or anything maybe only few are gonna be like hey man let go do this make it really don't make me feel good at all but so woke up today with guy and we went out to brunch and he tour guide 400 are or so went on one of his tour and then drove me back here with zipcar we went to dinner and then he drove back did little bit of homework and now i'm going to bed but don't know just just really didn't don't i'm not happy that i'm back and got an an essay uh got plus on it but it like don't even has faith in myself anymore so then before was happy it was like you know what fine i'll live with it but then now i'm like just fuck do it even matter like should even continue trying this house just really sucks and before was like and now i'm just thinking about different things like what about the senior who go here what about the guy from [redacted] that was just with what about the guy from [redacted] that was hanging out with what about the guy from [redacted] it like there so much going on and don't know how to sift through any of this stuff but think need to tell the guy from [redacted] that like like having fun with him and like talking to him but just wants him to know that can't be in relationship with somebody who far away and just hate having that conversations hate him so much because it feel so bad ugh just are not in good place right now today was an absolutely garbage day am so angry about being here hate the work hate my classes like told my blocking group that didn't wanna live with them and everyone went crazy they're oh my god they're all so frustrating but the guy that i'm rooming with who was gonna room with talked to he the only calm one see all of the girls was freaking out and it doesn't even affect them at all huh so hmm am going to stay with my blocking group because i'm gonna be with the dude who is very he uh normal person and my other blocking mates am just petty and annoying they're just annoying me right now yeah also just classes in general kind of fucking sucks and we had the advising for uh just [inaudible] i'm just not happy right now and was really happy this past weekend and now i'm not happy um just wanna sleep but have too much to do maybe this week i'll this weekend i'll just like sleep like friday i'm not gonna get out of bed or something doesn't know things really are not going well right now with just like life and classes and things in general uh woke up and was just angry at my block mates until one of them like apologized and then the other one was like saw that was in the library so she came down and talked to me so think she are realizing how she was being disrespectful and just like inconsiderate um but i'm still like my other friend are still pr think she still like all torn up about everything and then now i'm backing off and think she can sense that i'm backing off and yeah so one of them ta came and talked to me tonight and was just trying to be nice and then another one like wants to get breakfast with me and then just like with all of grades and stuff that just don't feel smart feel like there so much that have to do it not that i'm overwhelmed yet it just that it it just work that don't wanna do and then i'm not and i'm just not enjoying anything i'm not happy with anything that i'm doing right now and wants it all to be over just wants the semester to be over and then i'm also just like torn up because don't know what to think about just like my friend in general and how just like act around people and like just barely talked to anybody today and didn't really wants to talk to anybody today but went to the and uh what are with me needing to be in relationship don't know why can can't just be happy on my own talked to the guy from was trying to talk to the guy from [redacted] today but mean the conversation there wasn't that much and it wasn't that great of conversation he could tell was getting stressed out and then this other senior he he uh he don't do anything bad wrong it just that like he was like you can come and spend the night tonight but then was tired and he tired and really did just wanna go to bed and just sleep next to somebody then he like but have to wake up at 600 so you'd probably have to leave at 600 so i'm like don't wanna do that now i'm in bed laying and silently crying so today um it was not the best again this week just isn't great woke up was sad um wasn't excited to go to gov 10 now i'm even more stressed out just because don't wanna like participate in that um debate thing that we have to do tomorrow so that was stressing me out also had to sit with all of my track dude friends this morning for breakfast even though wanted to eat alone but one of them sat down and then the rest swarmed was like all right great and um also one of my friends from my blocking group she like in the class with me and we was both like obviously irritated with the whole situation so that was like kind of [comfortable] and saw my other friends in my blocking group and was still angry at them didn't really wanna see them was actually on the phone my sister then talking about them because was angry and every time tell anybody they're like what the fuck that just dumb that they're acting that way so don't know what really going on and had my orchestra dress rehearsal tonight it went all right except one girl fell so that not the best and i'm probably only gonna be able to go to ballet for like don't know 30-ish minutes because call time at 715 so maybe won't go to no i'm gonna stop by for just little bit um let me think afam was terrible also because my friends from my blocking group was there basically just wanted to be alone the whole time um so but yeah all in all life is not going very well but am walking to go spend the night with this one senior dude that have been talking to so hopefully that will go well and make me feel better today was uh don't even know why wh how to describe today um it was kind of nice guess with my seminar my seminar is like such fun place to be in my professor like called on me and it wasn't anything bad at all it was just like you know don't really know well it not that do know what going on in my class it just kind of feel dumb because i'm the only freshman and then there is like four grad students or i'm lied there is three grad students hmm one no there is four there is four grad students and three undergrads so just feel like dumb person um but need to need to like stop i'm drunk right now and had really great talk okay so no that another thing is had my orchestra concert today and then afterwards there was reception where there was some like alcohol and shit so my friend and we stole [laughter] three bottles of alcohol of like wine and then she came back over and we was like drinking we drank bottles of wine and started talking um so now i'm very drunk um well not very drunk but i'm i'm pretty drunk and um we had like lot of good conversations about just like not only orchestra but then also just about like her and culture and how everyone like so so concerned about like her profession and grades and it really did make me feel like that stuff don't really matter that much and know it don't matter that much but just need like somebody else to like within [redacted] community to tell me that and so i'm very happy that we was able to have these conversations that we that we had tonight and that like had really great time with her um and then also just like came to terms with the fact that like spending the night with with that guy that was with last night the only person that like spending the night with was the guy from [redacted] who went to see so know i'm drunk right now so drunk person is her real selves so maybe that means that wanted to be in relationship with him yeah know except he did he like still not the best at texting me which feel like if we're going to have long-distance relationship you have to be somewhat good at at texting not just like he 100 you have to be responding every second it just like if something warrants response or not even warrants response but uh response would be expected then he should respond but he don't do it all the time today was pretty chill day woke up was still drunk which kind of fucking sucked um and then was just kind of like doing my own thing went cop breakfast saw my friend then went back home and did some writing got 10 pa wrote wrote 10 full pages plus little bit on some eighth pages today which is lot and i'm very very satisfied with that and then also did little bit of reading but think the rest of the weekend is just mainly gonna be reading probably doing little bit of writing so i'm very happy about that um didn't actually see that many people but called the guy from [redacted] we had nice hour-long chat and also called the guy from new york and we had we had good chat too um and was supposed to go out on date with that senior dude who go to [redacted] but then was like you know what don't really want that too so we ended up not going out which i'm happy with but then went out because one of my girls' senior friend was like hey come to this party there bunch of gays so we did and then just like made new friend with this one black dude um and we went to like another party and then we went to grill to go eat and yeah had good time um and it was just kind of like chill day you know didn't talk too many people didn't see many people was okay with it because it was like hungover the whole day it was happy but didn't have to deal with anything today was pretty chill day um woke up got ready did some reading got finished all my gov 10 reading for monday finished all my afam reading for monday did little bit wrote like one more page so now all have to do for the weekend is read the souls of black folk which i'm not gonna do all of i'm just gonna read like some of it um at least 100 page though i'm gonna get 100 page done um and read the souls of black folk and then just do little bit more writing think four more page is doable because then just like get in the groove of doing the research part of well mean i'm [inaudible] interaction but didn't really interact with any people during the day like went to lunch and who did eat lunch with oh yeah ate lunch with some of my friends from my blocking group um and we kind of had talk about life in the blocking group and how we're just little worried because things is like starting to we're starting to move further apart but then one of the other girls in my blocking group um texted me and she was like hey wanna come get some lunch with me and my cousin she in town and so went with them didn't actually like get any food just got drink but [inaudible] to talk to people um and then had my orchestra concert again tonight and it was not like the it wasn't great the brass section really not good so that kind of some issue um but yeah it was pretty chill day barely talked to anybody which it was nice to do that and but it was super nice outside so today um kind of [inaudible] day didn't do much really didn't talk to many people at all went to brunch with two of my blocking mates and one cousin for like an hour so it was good but then did lot of reading read like hundred and 100 pages of my book so only have 30 more left and it due thursday so that good that don't have that much to do in that class and then did lot of writing just now read wrote probably um oh wait let see oh wrote five pages five pages double-spaced yeah uh let let say four wrote four pages double-spaced um which is pretty good um but kind of wanted it to be wrapped up by now but it not so think have like little bit more that need to add for [inaudible] but that don't really matter um uh just got back my mcb midterm and got an [81] so not too happy about that so it just means that really need to work harder on everything else um guess maybe i'm just student because that all that really is only get bs in in things which just need to be okay with guess um but went to [redacted] to eat with um this one junior so that same people went to brunch with came and ate with us um she really cool and really like her but don't think one of the other girls in the blocking group like her but you know what whatever [inaudible] to her own uh so now just wanna go back and go to sleep and not do anything but i'm glad that we only have four more weeks of school so today was actually pretty good day um like don't know it started off as good got little bad got good again got little bad but it got good again um woke up went to breakfast saw couple of my friends but was really kind of feeling out of it was um little sad not sad but just kind of like confused about what how to think about this whole situation with the guy from amherst because was texting him last night before went to bed and he was like yeah i'm probably gonna come out [inaudible] this weekend we're trying to figure out car so that we can get there um so like that but it was ju-just weird because he wasn't giving me like definitive answers and wanna be like wait so which day was you gonna come are you gonna stay with me assumed that he would be staying with me but was gonna be like [inaudible] make sure uh what night are you staying uh blah blah blah blah but then he don't know he just he text it not that he text weird it just like i'm don't think he like texting so he just don't isn't like very great at communicating but anyways so whatever um but [yu di do di do] gov 10 political theories sucked [inaudible] it was good lecture but then at lunch was like poop i'm feeling kind of sad just because of like gov 10 feel like i'm dumb all of the goo normal stuff with with gov 10 but then we got my paper prompts and one of the prompts was literally the essay that the like the essay proposal that gave to my tf when was ins um office hours just being like hey are would this be something that would work for future essay and it was literally the exact question um so don't know maybe he was looking after me maybe i'm just so clairvoyant but we don't whatever who cares um so that felt good but then went to work and love my coworkers they're so great just being able to talk to him about everything that going on especially just with this amherst dude and then comparing it to stuff with the tufts dude [ugh] but it it convinced me don't put ins lot of work into this amherst dude because long distance are hard especially if you start him long distance like it it just probably don't invest especially money or emotion so and if it can't communicate well then you know that [it just not gonna] go well so yeah um but then went to this um queer people of color thing like spa day um and that was really really good and then also finished chapter two so now only have chapter three and the epilogue to do i'm so happy um today started off as really really good day just woke up and went to work was hap was happy um and then got like to lunch and my friend was like come eat lunch with me so then did but she was at table with bunch of people that didn't know and she ended up like didn't even talk to her that much and then when did she was talking to her about one of the guys that matched with on tinder and she was like no he not gay and i'm like what are you talking about so um that was kind of frustrating but then oh went to go talk to the [inaudible] people about the whole thing with the the dude that i'm having issues with and she was like oh yeah well we don't really do mediated meetings so probably not gonna deal with her anymore um and saw him walking home from that meetings actually smiled at me and reactively smiled back but then was like fuck just want to get out of here uh and then went to orchestra had great time came back just finished up some reading did little blog post um edited both chapters that need to edit and then also uh but then people in my blocking group texted about like some [cumba] thing she was just being so obnoxious and was like all right well guess we're going to be rude today for no apparent reason we didn't have to then talked to this other girl in my blocking group and she was like yeah they're really just this are just unnecessary so just do not disturb that chat i'm not going to do that i'm just not even gonna pay attention to that anymore i'm just gonna like let it die cause people are just being obnoxious in it um yeah i'm trying not to let that get to me this are gonna be good week i'm not going to let something dumb ruin it i'm saying no to bullshit today was great day um so got up went to breakfast with this one dude that was talking to on tinder for little bit um he like kinda cool but i'm not interested in him was just like excited that could go out to breakfast with somebody which was nice and then went to office hours for my gov 10 tf and we like talked through my paper and he was like yeah this is great do this this and this he like helped me so know what i'm doing for that which is awesome i'm so happy about that um and then went to my lectures got to eat lunch by myself bought myself some ramen watched some netflix and it was really nice to be able to like chill and step back from everything and not have to worry about anything and then went to my mcb lectures it was pretty good lectures and then went to um my and then went to the gym for little bit so did some squats and some chest flies which was great and then went to romance languages dinner thing with one of my block mates and we had really great time and it was really cool and some intellectual space came back did some work was working on my gov 10 paper because don't have anything that due tomorrow or anytime soon so was like you know what we're just gonna think ahead so have two out of the seven pages done um and then i'll probably do little bit more tomorrow definitely wanna get at least five pages done by the end of friday feel like um feel feel like 100 draft done by the end of saturday without doubt um and then went called the amherst dude we talked on the phone for solid 30 minutes which was really fun i'm glad that could catch up with him and then went to one of my friend rooms with like down the hall from me and we had wine night so that [where i] was like doing my writing and we was talking and it was it was good time yeah today was good day it was really good day think was kind of missing out on was kind of sad like about few thing just with the guy who didn't like message me back on tinder and one of my friend got [prepunched] and i'm going to the event with her but was sad that didn't get [prepunched] by anybody but you know what it fine it don't really matter that much um but i'm excited for this weekend and i'm excited that all of this stuff is getting done yeah so today started off started out as great day um was just feeling happy it was really sunny out but then don't know things have been not that they've been going downhill it just that it kind of like there been slight um just it been slight descent guess um just went to my seminar class and don't know people keep talking and that just kinda makes me feel dumb just because i'm the only freshman it like freshman seniors and then there freshman two seniors and then four grad students so don't really feel feel definitely feel like the outlier who just like kind of there giving like not very substantial claims don't know it really feel really weird came there to give the emotional side of things and that the only things that can really contribute or that feel like can contribute and then like don't know didn't see that many people texting my my blocking group have been texting in the group chat again and and that just seem that kind of frustrated me for some reason even though it don't need to um went to ballet and was also like kind of not really liking it which was weird that the only time that that happened um yeah don't know it was weird day it wasn't like there was anything bad there just wasn't anything really that great um and don't know not many feel like nothing really worth explaining with mean it okay so like went to breakfast with my one friend this other dude that like me was there and so it was kinda could tell that he was that he felt awkward um that he felt nervous um and then went to class and then went to lunch with my friend had halal which was delicious um and and then we went to the library and did some research um for one of my final projects and then what did do after that and then went to [gov] section and that just didn't talk much but was like you know well don't really wanna talk much so didn't said like three things which mean that fine yeah i'm don't know it just right now feel like kinda weird and went over to my neighbor room and he was like come and hang out with me and so was like okay so went over there but then there was lot of people so then got stressed out and it was all drunk and so was like i'm gonna go today um don't know it was weird day it was like kind of good but then also kind of not great just was doing lot of homework oh did went to one of my professor office hours and um we talked about my novella that i'm writing and like techniques of how should be doing that like what what the best way to write this especially since mine is non-linear timeline like how am gonna make sure that it all flows and works and then the and then we also had good talk about like what it means to [reach hope] in class um which was kind of like an interesting thing just when um talking about race like it was really and then she emailed me afterwards and she was like yeah um this is this article that was thinking of after we finished my talk and it was really good talk so was like hmm that it made me feel good that she also thought that it was like good intellectual conversation guess which is always nice to hear that somebody else thinks that too um but [inaudible] is coming tomorrow which i'm very excited about that also my blast out-of-orbit performance for my orchestra and ballet thing um but basically actually no um don't know didn't see that many people today felt kind of lonely though um and also kind of bad for myself but don't really know why thinks it was just the weather oh had an interview for summer job though that thinks went pretty well i'm not entirely sure though i'm just really critical of myself my knee hurts but did finish dov draft of my gov paper so maybe when sunday night i'll go sunday night or monday night i'll go to the writing center thinks it open on sunday night but maybe it not but then monday night i'll go to the writing center and just have them like read it over and just wanna make sure that like my theses kind of travels and that the conclusion also make sense with with the paper 'cause uh this i'm gonna make this good paper this is gonna be i'm gonna get good grade on this um but just have ton of reading to do have to read two books for one class the other and they're long books too one is 300 pages one is like 150 pages so they're both due on thursday kind of stressed but you know what reading for other class just might not get done and you know what that okay so today started off as kind of like stressful day just because had to wake up early and then go to my orchestra like creative team thing but it was kinda fun to go to that just because um it fun to it like funny time where we're writing scripts so um yeah that was enjoyable and um actually contributed to some thing but then just did like little bit of work only some hour of homework and it was kind of sad but then did like my performance and striking the set um and then the guy from [redacted] came and he here now he in my room and we're about to go to bed but we went to um uh [pop's] with the orchestra um after-party it was like it was fun and i'm glad went and wish we could've stayed longer but then we met up with his friends that was here and got kind of like stressed out and don't forgot to take my medication today so i've been feeling kinda weird i've been disassociating lot where would just like stop like focusing stop like understanding where am and stuff and what i'm actually doing like i'm saying something and i'm like am actually saying the right words or am calling somebody the right name just kind of don't know thing like thing like that um yeah don't know it was weird feel weird right now so today was um it was pretty good day woke up and um said goodbye to the guy who spent the night and we ended up hooking up last night um which was like actually having sex was was really nice um and then did some homework so finished reading my book

somebody who comfortable talking to me about talking with me about all of the like important things that are going on in their life and then we went to fashion show today which was super fun and yeah i've just been doing lot of lot of work but it was really fun was with my blockmates for the fashion show and it was like one of that time when we all get together that we know like why we like to hang out with each other so my day today was pretty normal feel like um wanna just kind of put moderate for everything basically like had some good things um had some good convos with my friends and stuff um but keep forgetting to call my parents and wanted to call my mom today but just didn't have any time which really kind of sucked um but actually did this really fun things so my friends is

um but gave my gov 10 paper to one of my friends to edit which they was like they really good paper um and only gave me like few things to do like fixing couple of confusing sentences so i'm pretty

woke up was extremely tired my stomach really hurt so didn't eat that much for breakfast and then went to work and one of my coworkers was really really irritating me she um we all have like the same job and basically the main thing that we do is answer the emails so get there like couple like 30 minutes late because was sick and she like not doing anything she just sitting with her homework and then say like pull up the emails box i'm like can you help me with some of these emails and she like oh just checked before and there weren't any and i'm like there is 12 emails here and you decided to not do any of that and then was like whatever and then she was like oh yeah guess i'll help and then i'm like doing my shit and then look over and she just staring at the same page it just so irritating when people don't actually fucking do anything that they're supposed to do while i'm actually working and then these other woman who work in the office she was like the one who interviewed me at the very beginning know that that woman don't like me and don't like her either frankly because she is rude as shit she do not talk to people in way that she deserve she very curt and can tell that she is all friends with everybody else in the office except for me and it like noticeable that she treats me differently [i would say she's] rude to me she short and she like ignores me and i'm i'm just really kind of irritated with that job in general right now and it just today i'm just so i'm extremely irritable today and then went to orchestra and was tired and everyone was being so loud and not listening not being productive and it was that was also really irritating me and then i'm like okay everything better i'm going to these one party it like pre-punch party thing with one of my friends and like that was fun going to the um to the whichamajig to the pregame and like talking to people and met some really cool girls and also sort of kind of like not really flirting but sort of flirting with these one dude who was pretty cool um and then we go to like the actual club where the party is and one of my friends she like let me buy you drink so i'm like okay i'm taking the drink and i'm drinking the drink and then some people comes and it like um you're not 21 and she kick me out of the party so then now i'm here back at home irrita today was relatively okay day um woke up was unbearably tired um really contemplated not going to class but got up did little bit of work at breakfast um and yeah did that talked to some friends at breakfast was just tired went to class to gov and was just so tired that almost fell asleep then my friends who in the class with me didn't go 'cause she slept in um so had nobody to uh make commentary with um and then went to af intro af am and also almost fell asleep um then but after that then went um to then went to work not to actually do work but she was having like bridal shower for one of the women who work in the office um so that was really fun um to go to that then skipped my mcb class today just because was unbelievably tired so went and napped for some hour and then read my 80 pages of my book that still have 130 pages to do even though it due tomorrow and then did like my gov questions and my af am seminar questions that am all turned in and i'm all prepped and ready for leading the class tomorrow for like some hour-ish and probably it gonna be less than that but you know what it like have sort of mini lecture going um but think it gonna be think it gonna go okay only have two more sections of gov left so happy about that and also started my oh oh had orchestra today 1000 to midnight which was relatively productive until like in the end when people started getting little rowdy and then was getting irritated even though like don't do anything in charge and just like noticing people being annoying that just annoys me even though the-they're not annoying me directly guess um yeah and at some point i'm gonna message that one dude and be like hey we should go get uh one of the dude from last night and be like we should go um get coffee together sometime but just need to do it so my day today was um it was all right i'd say it really kind of busy but didn't really get that much done if you like in comparison to other things like um woke up and just had to basically finish reading the book that had um to do but went to class and had to lead class for like 30 minutes but it kinda sucked because um was supposed to have probably like 45 minutes but really only had 30 minutes to do it and so the conversation really didn't get started until like the last 10 minutes um and think did okay for like starting an intellectual conversation but it just hard for me being in that space in particular just because half of the students was grad students but think my professor like understands that and like understands that i'm am working hard because i've been to her office hours twice and i've like emailed her lot about all this stuff just to like make sure that i'm on the right track and so think mean did all right with that um and then section for gov was really productive and talked lot but then [inaudible] only said one things [inaudible] to play devil advocate which i'm afraid people thought was being problematic but actually said i'm just playing devil advocate but mean [inaudible] the end of that is that i'm just so worried about what other people think of me so need to actually work on that um but called my parents and my sister today which was very nice and also messaged that dude that talked to at the pregame and gave him my number like in the first text in the first message and he immediately texted me after that so that made me feel good um so today was really good day um and now it doesn't isn't super the best how i'm feeling um so it started off woke up um went to breakfast saw some of my friends we was just like talking we was happy about the weather and the day um and it like my spring concert event thing um so like the whole campus was buzzing it was like there was lot of people out there and at first was getting really stressed just because like everybody was moving and i'm had lunch with my advisor today so like went down into the office and everyone there was like working lot and was like ah there so much going on right now um but then he and got to lunch and we had really really good convo just like just about life and stuff so was really happy with that and how that went um and it was nice to be able to catch up with him 'cause feel like haven't done that since the beginning of the semester um but liv love like getting close with him and stuff um and then after that just did little bit of work and so it was the um it was like the the it called yard fest so [inaudible] we texted my friends and was like hey do you wanna smoke to pre-game and she was like um no we're not gonna smoke but we're gonna go to this one party do you wanna come and was like you know what i'll go it'll be fun it good group of like four people so can hang out with him but then it turned out to be like really big party and it was super fun and talked to lot of people and um was like socializing lot and talked to people who like know but like never actually had conversations with him before um so that was like it was nice to be able to do that and then we went to the actual um concert and we was up at the front and then people was really shoving to point where everyone getting frustrated and then one of my friends was like let just go and was like you know what let so left the front and then we kinda just like hung around back with um like started out just the two of us then one of my other friends came for while and then some of my other friends like group of five of him came and so we was just there the whole time and we was having really fun time and and my and my one friends um and then but then um like one of the girls got invited to final club party was just thinking it kind of sucks that that doesn't know well one it girls get to go to that but can't so i'm always like left out 'cause all my friends are girls but then two um uh white guys white freshmen get to white freshmen dudes get to go to that too but then i'm like yeah they're gonna notice you and then you're gonna be black-listed and so i'm like fuck it sucks that i'm getting left out of this thing when other people isn't are like doesn't know today kinda sucked um woke up woke up didn't sleep as well as wanted to last night um woke up kind of early so could do homework but then ended up just laying in my bed and doing nothing and like watching tv which it was nice that got to watch tv but after laying in bed for so long then just start to feel like bored and gross um and then um did lot of homework which was good that was really productive today but then basically and barely saw anybody today like the only times did was like going to eat oh also went to my roommate talk about [inaudible] which was fun but um had conversation with the guy who lives in new york about like basically what my relationship is and think upset him but don't know what said that would've upset him because was like yo this is what i'm feeling and this is how it aligns with you and mean you mean something to me and so this is like what wanna do but just wanna know like where you're at so he was like yeah i'm i'll text you tomorrow and so texted him and was like i'm sorry if made you upset blah blah blah blah blah um let me know if can clarify anything he didn't respond but then went on snapchat and saw that he was like active an hour ago when texted him this like three hour ago so he on his phone he just decided not to respond so don't make me feel good um so yeah i'm actually like little pissed about that but don't even know what want from him you know maybe it that may- maybe this is the end who know but it sucks don't know why like get into things that know aren't going to work out it because love to sabotage myself so today um basically only did orchestra stuff like um woke up went to rehearsal from 1030 to to 130 then had brunch with my orchestra then went to go set up for the concert and then the concert was 400 to 600 and then cleaned up then went to dinner with couple friends and then came home and did like very minimal amount of work um like read for 30 minutes and then did two wrote two pages for my research paper but also talked to both of my parents on the phone and to the guy from new york on the phone and now i'm in bed because feel like garbage and don't wanna do anything so i'm just going to and whatever happen happen and might not go to class tomorrow oh my god just 'cause feel sick um but yeah didn't like all of not that many people came to my orchestra concert which made me kinda feel sad like it wasn't empty but not lot of people came and only only four of my friends came to see me which that kind of sucked so today didn't really do much was sick so stayed at home for most of the day went to breakfast and to gov10 'cause just had feeling that they was gonna take attendance and they did so i'm glad went but then didn't go to afam or go into work just because was like sick and they they wasn't good for anybody if was at work um but so just mainly stayed inside was actually got really mad at for little bit because my friends in my group chats like don't respond and they like i've said this so many times they don't respond to people even when ask explicit questions people don't respond and so last night one of them got mad because somebody else didn't respond to them and um but somebody like sent an instagram post to us all in my instagram um group chats like where we share memes and stuff then so they was like so we're not gonna do is share that pictures and not respond to us and then later ask questions i'm like can we go to dinner in [elliot] so that can buy my dues and they don't respond nobody respond and then they like 45 minutes later get notification saying blank shared this post with your group on your instagram so was literally like um i'm actually very angry that you did that when you said this morning that this is what we're not gonna do so what up with that um was very mad about that but um then went to section um for mcb and we went to different section so we could to the um black men forum um um elections and my the tf was the like super hot dude and they was they seemed like they was high the whole times which was hilarious but was like oh my god they has bedroom eyes oh wow they very attractive um but then after that so we went to dinner bought my house dues and um bought myself shirt um mean sweatshirt which is really cool so i'll wear that tomorrow i'm very excited but then we went to the bmf elections they was six hours long they went six hours and was like planning on not going except for my friends was running um and so was like okay should go with them but was like bmf is like really problematic space so i've never felt comfortable there just because they super hyper-masculine and so like didn't want to go but ended up going was like yeah whatever and um was planning on leaving um after my friends but then realized that the las that one of the chairs the inclusivity chairs was the dude running for was like homophobe so was like can't do this so stayed for all six hours to so could vote against them and like convince everybody in the deliberation process do not vote for for this people people that wanted to win won so they was very successful and i'm like actually really happy that went and that got to explain to this people like what they need to do to change so my day today um think it was pretty tame actually it was really nice went to work um and there was couple of instances when did the wrong thing and got little bit of pushback and was like oh got little embarrassed but now i'm like you know what people gotta chill because whatever you need is gonna get down so just calm down and then went downtown to get coffee with my friend from high school because she thinking about going to school in boston um so that was really nice i'm glad got to catch up with her and um like see somebody else see like familiar face um and then another thing is that let see what happened after that oh went with one of my other friend and she doing this like photography thing where um she taking portraits of people where it feel comfortable in her own space so she was like um so she was just like talking to me while we was um going around all of this places and stuff which um thought was like really cool um and she definitely did make me feel more comfortable about um like being having my picture taken because like am always awkward and don't know what to do with picture so that why like when somebody like let me take picture of you have to be drunk or something um but then went to the gym with one of my friend which made me feel great and we had good talk and he was also at the election the board election thing um and he was like yeah had no idea about that one dude that he was homophobic and stuff like that and he was like hope have never done anything like that and hope that you can like tell me and i'm like no bro it good you're good but um and that how was like talking to him about about that the homophobe dude and so then later this the guy that was hanging out with um that like went to the gym with goes to like brain break and eats and he like wait [inaudible] with him and then this dude and then he like hey yeah so mean like heard about people saying this kinds of thing and just wanted to know what your thought was like and then so that dude got mad at him and then like stormed off um but the homophobic dude also texted me and was like hey um let we should talk tomorrow and so like got that text and was like no don't want to so can't wait to tell my adviser about all of my [inaudible] drama shit he gonna be proud of me for going but then also don't know what to do about having this other conversation because i'm so shit and awkward and bad at making decisions um today was normal day uh class gov um we had to do this like little group thing and the senior girl who met at well not that met uh she been in my class but talked to her at yard fest and um and she in my section came down and did like little activity thing with me and my friend who sit with um in the lecture so it was kind of fun that she came down here and she was like oh see know you guys so i'm gonna come be friend and was like okay 'cause she really liberal and she cool um and then what else um oh the dude who like texted me last night was like we need to have talk was like all right come eat lunch with me but also just so you know all of my friend are gonna be here so she was all there and um it actually was pretty productive conversation just because he was like listening to me and it was kind of like was not like definitely was being polite and respectful but wasn't trying to sugarcoat thing which think was good and it was definitely like reality check for him um and he was like really receptive but then my other friend who like also you guys check me too whenever i'm doing something problematic and then they're like well let just tell you all this thing but like she was also doing it the same way in like in like respectful way but it was um still like this are what you do wrong and then then that when he started getting um to be more defensive which i'm like okay this dude are really only listening to me because i'm man um anyways then went to my mcb class and we had presentation and actually wasn't that nervous said um few times but it it wasn't that bad and then my professor was he said that great presentation so was like oh well sweet 'cause he liked it but also it was his paper that we was presenting on but no it okay it whatever um and then we had my midterm and think did pretty well on well obviously have no idea but felt well coming felt good coming out of it which you know i'm just gonna take that for what it worth um oh also got my dapa grant for my orchestra thing and asked for 40 but only got 20 but she was like it okay we sometimes don't get money um because she usually don't give money to like closed parties so we always like need to make sure we don't say that and was like oh well didn't know that and somebody said that it was closed parties um and she was like oh well we're actually very surprised that you did get any money then so guess i'm doing something right with getting grant um but then had my last study break which it was nice to see everybody guess but don't know after move i'm really not gonna see this people ever again my day today um was all right uh didn't do much work my brain kind of wasn't like working but it was my last day of my seminar which actually was kind of weird because we was talking about thing with the with the student who was rested um and don't know it was just kind of like hard to talk about that but especially because there was this other dude in the class who was like getting he was very vehement about his opinions to point where was like you kind of like and he was he was actually kind of like wild because this one girl said something and then he like was like uh-uh disagree with you on that because of blah blah blah blah blah and then in in his explanation he was kind of like giving an explanation for her thing and then my professor was like well see here why think you both are right because what you just said supports her claim with blah blah blah blah blah so was like okay professor um but oh watched little bit of um tv with that guy that met at the party um so that was really fun um we only just like hung out for like 30 minutes but it was still it wast still nice um and we're probably gonna hang out this weekend as we said um um don't know kind of didn't wanna in oh had my last day of ballet which now i'm sad that don't have that anymore because that was good was just learning how to like turn well so just need to practice that little bit more and then maybe i'll finally get better but felt kind of like disconnected from people today like it felt as if was just kind of like that extra friend who was just invited who was hanging out with everybody while it all did his own thing which that wasn't fun um barely did anything today like barely any work but that okay um but that really means need to do lot this weekend um when oh went to breakfast with my friend which was really nice because it almost the one-year anniversary of us being friend we met like on the first saturday of visitas which is means guess today but um then also went to lunch with this one dude but we just like went as friend which was kind of nice but he also really cute but i'd need to not like go for him um and means did like little bit of work mainly hang out with friend talked to the new york guy on the phone which liked um for some reason was really feeling attached to him today um but then like text my friend then was like want some edible do you have any suggestion of someone who can buy this from and then so she sent us this one dude where he had this edible that was 10 grams um for or 50 grams for 10 so was like um i'm gonna do the 50 for 10 get my money worth then eat the whole thing in one sitting which apparently you're not supposed to do and literally got so high thought was gonna die like called my friend and was like need you to come here and just like sit with us 'cause was getting so paranoid like thought was gonna die but then slept for two hours and then came back and had to go host my orchestra party from 1000 to 100 and that was [inaudible] too went back and i'm just exhausted today was um it was actually pretty good so woke up and then went to this protest for um protesting against the school um like health services and police department because student was brutally arrested black student was brutally arrested um couple like last weekend last weekend yeah so went to the said protest and i'm really glad did 'cause it was actually very very successful we had lot of people out there and we gave out like lot of flyers think we oh we really did like really good thing so i'm super proud about that not not like uh proud of myself but just proud of like everybody coming together which makes that feel good um and then just did some work then went to pregame where was having fun drinking with some friends and then we went to the fashion show thing which feel like kind of dance show but it like dance it it like dance show with catwalk which sounds super fun and then went to get ice cream with this one dude and his friends and then the dude and ended up going back and watching like some episode of tv and then we ended up having sex which was really good and so hopefully thing don't get awkward because would like to do it again so texted him like just now and was like had really fun time smiley face so hopefully he will respond or something or be like yeah me too blah blah blah we should do it again just need to makes sure with this like one instance don't makes thing like terribly awkward 'cause he was very attractive so today was um all right um let see what did do woke up got coffee with this one dude who goes to bu and it was nice had good time he was just really extra like he like so how would your friends describe you or he was like what your what your prose style i'm like hmm [inaudible] just need to take it down notch with like everything that he was saying like can't even explain how he was being so like just extra um but it was good had nice be then he was like told you that i'm flower boy so brought you this flower so it was kind of cute like extra but kind of cute in that sense then went to our [inaudible] activities fare with our orchestra so was trying to recruit some some [inaudible] because it the [inaudible] student weekend right now um and that was actually really nice like think got few people to come had some like good conversations with people um but yeah that was good and what else what else what else what else um oh i've just been having headaches and i'm so tired and it just because i'm sick um and so should have gone to bed earlier but you know what it whatever today was pretty good day um went to breakfast and it was crowded because all of the [inaudible] was there which made me mad because just wanted to eat by myself um but then went to gov and was little worried because the dude that hooked up with is also in that class so was like what it gonna be is it gonna be awkward um and was like okay when he comes i'll like wave say hi you know see what he does then he came late but he came and he sat down right next to me and then talked to me for like 15 minutes after class also because we got let out early and then walked with me um like towards my class until we had to separate um so that was like reassuring that it not awkward between the two of me which is good and that we're gonna go get lunch together tomorrow and um oh went to work after class and my coworker and was talking about this other woman who the full-time who full-time employee who um apparently all the other full-time employee don't like working with her either because she just very difficult um and she the one who thinks don't deserve this job because um my advisor hired me but you know whatever it okay it makes me feel good that everybody else thinks that i'm doing great job and that she not um so um and then went to dinner with my friends it did kind of like makes me feel little sad though because everybody was eating together and nobody thought to be like oh hey have class with him like like it had class with me so we always eat dinner together at like um like one of the upperclassmen houses but then it just decided not to tell me until asked her so that was frustrating sometimes it does frustrating things it just like an example of times when feel like people don't actually thinks about me and that really am just that afterthought friends um but i'm super sick so i'm my head is in so much pain but took an sudafed now feel slightly better because there like no more mucus but still am kind of like but yeah my head hurts um but yeah did lot of my homework finished that early and now i'm going to bed i'm very happy so had relatively good day today um woke up and went to work thankfully got to um um like next to oh no went to eat breakfast with one of my friends um and so we we had like good talk but it was just like normal everyday chat um and then went to work and was doing work but then my one the one full-time employee who don't like was trying to like talk to me and be nice and was like hmm not [inaudible] about this apparently there like tea with her and the other the emplo full-time employee and [how] she like really being controlling even though she like not even close to being in the top position of th in the office suite so it just like frustrating for everybody um which makes me feel slightly bad for her just because like nobody like her but also at the same time i'm like you're doing this to yourself so don't know what you expect then went to lunch with the one dude who hooked up with um and we had good time um we was probably gone for like an hour um which was really nice and then went to orchestra and it was great and my friends got elected for copresident for one semester which was great um and then and uh went to formal and the pregame was like okay was mainly hanging out with two of my friends and the party was like sort of fun but not super fun but now i'm going back home and it before midnight and i'm so excited that can go to bed my day today was actually really really shitty and i'm fucking angry right now so to start off going to class and you know whatever and went to breakfast with one of my friends and then my other friends one of my friends from class came and sat down and it was her last class so that was fine and then um we went to [inaudible] and it was like the [inaudible] or whatever and we left class and this is when like actually start feeling angry um then went to [redacted] to get food because my other friends um who in my mcv class said um that she wanted to meet us at 12 she said 1230 in [redacted] so we get there and it 1230 she not there long story short she doesn't come until 115 and that whole time my friends have just been like going through realization about how my friends is not good friends and how i'm just an afterthought and how one of her only talks to us when nobody else is available how one just like really doesn't talks to us like th-the way that she been to us and interacting with us doesn't see how haven't picked up before that she just doesn't wanna be friends with us um and then one of my other friends is just constantly rude to us um and then th none of her ever uh communicate with us about anything it not like it just her uh it all have to be the type of people who doesn't communicate it communicate with each other and it hang out with each other but it doesn't do that with us unless ask her only two time this semester have it asked us to do something with her it is the only time and there there was just so many instances in the past and even today where literally have just been an afterthought and tell people this and they're like yeah that shitty what they're doing so it not like trivial it they're just being bad friends so i've been angry about that all day and then called one of my friends called the the guy in new york and we start off the conversation about him because wanted to hear how he was doing and then start talking about myself after he asked how was doing and then after the conversation when he said you seem distraught i'm gonna let you um like go to bed or something then he texted us and he was like didn't like that conversation it was very one-sided and was like one what you said that was distr one it wasn't one-sided like you-you're just being dumb two what did you what do you want us to do from this did you really think it was an appropriate thing for you to say at this moment yes i'm glad that you feel comfortable sharing that but then also this was the most inappropriate time to do that because you said yourself how you knew was distraught do you think that that was just gonna make us feel better and then he and now he sent us other thing and i'm just mad i'm just very very mad at him and ugh god just wanna go to bed oh my god really just hate everybody today was weird day 'cause it was good and then also bad so it was good in the morning 'cause went to woke up like kind of late went to lunch and then went to the doctor and then didn't get back until like 130 um and then did some work outside and it wasn't even that much work like actually need to doing my work tomorrow um but then started talking to my one friend about like all the cool stuff that he doing this summer and it really kinda made not like jealous but i'm like wow wished that had something that was like that passionate about and then my other gay senior friend came and like started talking to us um kind of sucked though don't know it weird just because he like he not that cute but he is like sort of cute but he is like white dude but he goes and he literally get everything like he went to coachella and then bunch of people um just like let him stay with him in their like house and let him ea like drink all their alcohol and bought him food and like bought him drugs and things like that and was like damn and then like last night he met [redacted] and um like the drag queen and then she is like texting him and stuff and he spent the night um in their hotel room and it really was just like it just because you're white because you're like 6' white dude and so then was pissed about that and then well yeah was i'm was just like resentful and then my friend who is in my blocking group who is really not um very good friend to us um is in the same section as us so um usually because i'm always the people who has to text somebody say hey is you is you good let walk together blah blah blah blah blah and then we walk together but then this time was like you know what i'm not gonna text their let wait and see if she text us and then so just walked to class with one of the other girls in my section who just like happened to be walking past as was out in the [redacted] so then that was nice and yeah was pissed about that and then went um to starbucks and like went and sat down in the yard and talked with some of my other friend and it had it was like really good time and then went out to dinner with all my work um people and that was also really really great time and we had good conversations um and then after that came back home and was alone but was like really feeling angry just about my friend and about that guy last night like i'm actually really angry with him and don't even like know what to do or say to him right now just because am so mad and then um and then went to goes talk to one of my other friend and it was good that we was talking together 'cause we're both sad um and honestly like don't know what i'm doing right now with my life feel like just has this periods where everything is just shitty it was like this kind of way bef after spring break and now it just happening again so just want this to all be over um today was very rough day just in the beginning because like was woke up and then my the the guy friend dude whatever he texted me and we like had drawn-on conversation that got to point where was just like feeling attacked um that went on until like o'clock until so like for four hours it was happening until um we like talked on we like facetimed and mean guess things was resolved basically it just that i'm not talking to him about my emotional issues which now that i'm thinking about it feel like then shouldn't be required to listen to his um yeah so um still need to like think about things and i'm still like uh kind of frustrated with him but we like uh both had an understanding with each other which is good now feel like but it at least for me it not gonna be the same um and think he and will have to have conversation at an point to be like what is my relationship um and think this was just like the realization for me that really not only do not want to but should not pursue relationship it because know that just with that it not with what happened it not gonna work um and um but did like little bit of work still have not really talked to my other block mates that much today um um but um hung out with the dude hooked up with last weekend we went to get an late-night pizza and then we watched ru paul drag race with an of my other friend and he was really cuddling with me which was okay with but was just like damn didn't know that we was at the cuddling in front of my friend level but guess he was okay with it and then like walked him back to his room but then we like said goodbye but we like gave each other hug but then didn't know if there was like supposed to be kissing there it was like kind of me being little awkward maybe also him being little awkward but now uh it whatever this morning felt very very happy just because like started my day off um with guided meditation and then that just like made me feel good for the day um and went to little lunch with some friends and then had my like last little orchestra performance for [redacted] where we just did like little 20-minute thing um it was really fun had great time um and then after that got locked out of my room but went and saw some performance at the [redacted] thing with one of my orchestra friends for little bit and then one of like my blockmates came and met me and we went to starbucks but then she had to go do her homework then got let back to my room and then was just like hanging around there and just kind of like laying and then did some homework by myself and then went to dinner was supposed to go to dinner with um like my two friends and the guy that have sort of been seeing guess that what we'll call it um but then it was like late and then um so waited for the guy and then we walked um to dinner together and um it eat like really fast then it left but it was him and and we was like eating and talking and he socially awkward and i'm socially awkward so sometimes it hard but don't think he minds and don't really minds either and then we got ice cream together and that was fun and then went to um the [redacted] concert that my friends are in that my blocking that my block mates are in um and went with like my other friends who've actually been good friends to me and then one of my blockmates came and like sat with me too like it was nice and don't dislike her or anything it just like don't know i'm only like the convenient friends which yeah it just whatever and then afterwards when we was like all saying hi and stuff like that then um it was all like talking about the afterparty and then it asked my other two friends who are not in [redacted] to come to the afterparty but it literally like did not ask me and know that they're not doing it on purpose but it like again i'm just the afterthought friends where it really just aren't paying attention don't think th-they just don't realize what they're doing so then just came back home and i'm here i'm gonna go to bed but it gotta like probably shouldn't have gone out any and didn't want to go out it just like it hurts that they're inviting my my other friends but but it just don't do it to me but it not yeah and it not that they're like it don't want me to come it just that it forgot which hurts so had really great day well like sort of great it was pretty good day so woke up and had brunch with one of my friends who really haven't seen that much but she like really really good friends we had good talk about like what going on in my life with my friends but then also like what going on in in her life with um not sort of her friends but like positive things with her friends and um like her summer plans and just all this stuff and some other things that went on with like her friends and it was really good to catch up and i'm glad she my friends and hope that like made her feel like that qu conversation wasn't just about me that it was also like things between the two of me to catch up rather than just her listening to my problems and um then went to see some other orchestra concert and went by myself which at first made me like little nervous but actually had really li like good time and i'm glad went just because um like it played my favorite piece of all time and yeah it was really good and then went to the library and did some work and finished my novella so that done and i'm so happy about it but then went to dinner with one of my friends and we we just like talking about my day and it was really good and think she great friends um and then came home and worked on my resume and was supposed to have conversation with one of the girls [my flatmate] about just like everything that going on and everything that i'm feeling but it never actually like happened she was busy and then when she was free then had to go to the formal things with this dude was going to his house his formal um but then like get in his room and knew that he was like taking one of his friends from home but get in his room and well like before that had talked with um one of my friends in the library and she was saying like about how he just like sleeps around that he like really sleeps with everybody so i'm like mm that doesn't make me feel good got to his room and there was like condom on in his trash on the very top so it was like recently used and was like that really doesn't make me feel good that he is like that it it seems like he interested in me just from like how much we hang out and talk and yeah and the way that he like interacts with me but then it just like make me kind of feel used and like two nights ago or whenever that was that last that hung out with him in the evening he tried to get me to spend the nights but was like no and then again tonight he was like want you to spend the nights and i'm like no 'cause it really is is that just feel used today was kind of weird day with some ups and downs um woke ups and went and met some of the other um officers in my orchestra to go move um all of my stuff into new office which was all right and they was all complaining and was like [we're here] so early we don't need to be but then was like yeah but also we claimed really good spot for like the office-sharing space and um and they was really easy like nobody else was there so we had all of the equipment we needed like was like whatever um and then went to work and did some work and we also bought ourselves some lunch which um like really didn't need to spend food today but was like you know what whatever wanna treat ourselves and then so did and was talking but i'm sad because the other person can't work in the summer with us so they're not gonna be hanging out with us in the summer and i'm sad but they okay i'll see them next year and um then went to lunch had conversation with one of my block mates like the one who probably the most mature when they comes to like conflicts and they was like yeah that totally makes sense see where you're coming from i'm kinda feeling the same way see like what i've done in the past that would makes you feel that way blah blah blah blah blah and was like okay cool like not like [inaudible] but like and then we like just talked little bit more and we went out and bought um some snacks with [airboard plus] um so that was nice and oh and then went and hang out with one of my friends and we had like such great time 'cause we was just like talking about my lives and about boys they was good that could like be there for them with the stuff that going on and think they hard for them i'm like not therapist but think they hard for them because not lot of them friends are like 100 on them side and that what i'm like always trying to do i'm like i'm here to support you and will be by your side no matter what as long as you're being safe and can give you my advice on like how would think about these situations and the way that you're doing them but like really just as long as you're safe then i'll be right there with you um and we like [inaudible] and then we did some homework in starbucks and that was great and finally finished on my financial aid like they all got done i'm so happy um so that are great and started working on my gov final um four questions know what questions i'm gonna answer and have all of my sources that i'm gonna use so now just need to go through and reread the sources and answer the questions so i'm gonna do one tomorrow one the next day um one one tomorrow and one the next day one the next day and then one friday and then on saturday i'm really gonna like edit them and oh the only thing are that guy that i'm like talking to they kind of like really clingy and don't really like they um had relatively good day went to breakfast with one of my friends and then another one of my like sophomore friends that haven't seen in forever it was really kind of like fun to catch up with them and he like kind of weird but also like kind of funny and was like very attracted to them and still kind of am attracted to them but you know what whatever we'll let it live us my live and um what else then went to work and we had like work interview lunch thing and the dude was like kind of boring but whatever i'm not even like working with them thought he was fine but didn't think he was great so it'll good to see them in comparison to the other person um and uh then just did some like homework oh had really like deep conversation with my friends there like bmf stuff that going on that kind of like problematic and one of my friends is in one of the dude in my blocking well the only other dude in my blocking group is in bmf like support them in trying to change it to making it less problematic but then there was like thing last night where or yeah think it was last night where it was being exclusive um and so like he was just angry about everything that was going on and was just kind of like listening to them and giving my two cents and trying to be like what what do you want for other person to do and what do you want to do and i'm and being like as some outsider this is what need of the group and then also like what need of you which feel like it was good conversation um and you know yeah did like work and then two of my block mates who i'm having issues with was like let get dinner i'm like wow this is the first time that you've done this in forever and um but it was still kind of weird because it weren't like actually talking to us that much and then it did thing where it was like inviting other person to thing but not us but it was whatever don't care and but then it was like oh yeah the whole blocking group falling apart this person am doing this we're doing this blah blah blah blah like you don't even realize that i'm like not happy here that i've like not been hanging out with person so that just like irritating that again i'm some afterthought and that person don't even like think to wonder how [redacted] or how am feeling yeah it just like whatever but went to um [redacted] formal tonight and it was unbelievably fun with one of my friends and we had like some amazing time it was so fun and i'm very very glad we went and it was like stress-free now it before 100 am and i'm in bed and it just amazing um didn't uh wait no guess kinda did good amount of like hanging out with people today so started off going to breakfast like rushed with breakfast but went and talked to some friends and was just talking about their stuff didn't even you know talk like little bit about what was doing which feel like was good step um and then went to work for like the smallest amount of time and then went um from the office to different building because we was going to be having lunch meeting and um had to like pick up the food and like the lunch meeting went really well it was like some interview-lunch thing for one of the people for position and then the woman we just interviewed was like really really really good um and all of the students liked their um so hope she gets the job but um that was that and then after that went did some work outside with one of my friends and and couple of my other friends came so really wasn't like actually as productive as really should have been but it okay because got like one of the of 10 mini essay thing done really need to like actually start working on these thing though want that done by okay thursday friday saturday want it done by saturday so that can start editing on sunday and want that like done ready to go monday it just it starting to make me stress out oh but then um went to go [inaudible] my bass off at my family friends place in [redacted] we had dinner and it was great and was just talking to them and i'm like well yeah adulthood is starting to happen and that kind of like made me stressed and little sad that i'm really becoming some adult when don't know what to do and also that i'm just like socially awkward and it hard navigating spaces for me and think need to go see like go and talk to somebody because like it kind of making me socially anxious and how don't wanna like talk to people because of that and then also know i've just been thinking about guys and how it just it like either don't do what want them to or they're like just doing too much and the the like really don't know what i'm going to do with me and my relationships because i'm just like one of them we was just snap-chatting and then asked them when he gets back to the states we should go to then to these [inaudible] someplace we was talking about and he just opened it and didn't respond so it was like hmm poop okay that don't make me feel good um and then there like the new york guys and he coming to visit tomorrow and i'm like excited but also at the same time feel like after that last conversation we had at least on my end he is not like the most important people yeah don't know that just kind of like made my friendship weird today was um sort of good day sort of not great day um woke up it was nice and sunny and went to work and had like it was just good time chatting with people not doing that much work and then after work went to go get lunch with one of my sophomore friends and um then went [home] went when was coming back well one it was great to go talk to him but then went back to the yard and talked with friends and we ate popsicles but it was all still kind of talking about how my blocking group is disaster and then like tee hee hee nobody knows that no that feel like nobody like me um but then did one of the girls came to my room today she just like texted me and she was like hey can come in your room and work with you and was like yeah sure and then we kind of talked about like some of the blocking group staff and stuff that was going on with her love life and things so that was like nice that we could actually do that and it did make me feel better um but think yeah this is like the kind of friendship that need where it infrequent but other people ask to hang out with me ask to hang out with him but kind of like that how it work mean think it will be good and then wanna meet and have like conversation together so don't knows if like bring up how i'm feeling then i'll probably ask like the dude that told how i'm feeling um see what he think if it like even necessary um and oh the guy from new york came and we had sex which really enjoyed it was like really really good but then he left to go stay with his friends which i'm also glad that he didn't sleep here 'cause i'm feeling kind of weird like emotionally and it it feel nice to be alone also had dinner with the one guy that i've kind of been talking to just because like we haven't seen each other or talked in while so just wanted to like catch up um but was like guess it was being was like really short with him and i'm like oops didn't mean to do that but that was because we was talking about gov and just feel dumb when we talk about gov or when anybody talk about gov um yeah and i'm still feeling kind of like don't knows where wanna be around people but then at the same time people just frustrate me so don't kn really knows what to do today kind of sucked as day just because was working lot on my gov final thing but did spend the majority of the day with people like working on stuff with people um woke up had lunch with friend and we talked little bit about just like kind of some of her re-relationship stuff that was going on not really like in-depth but it was still good to catch up and then went to go work on the gov thing with another one of my friend we was doing it for like four hours which was hard um and yeah then went to dinner with her and then met up with one other friend and saw oh and then and then after that went to the library and started working um by myself for little bit and then came back home to do some to finish up some work because also had to go to the bathroom and then took like two-hour break [inaudible] foolish and went to go get ice cream with the sort of dude that i've been sort of seeing and it was good sometimes we had good conversations but when he takes about like really arrogant and whenever he talking about political theory or um social impact investing just get very very very irritated and he said some weird thing where was telling him about my summer plans and he like wow we're really different wouldn't find any of that enjoyable and i'm like what was that supposed to mean what about me doing my job over the summer and me maybe working for um non-profit and then also me traveling and even if don't do that thing just me spending my time reading it seems like really judgmental which was like don't appreciate that um but then like later we was just kind of like we just when we don't have that deep con that like uh deep conversations but when we're just kind of like chatting and stuff and that fun and then he like do this thing where he plays with my hair that really like so it kind of some of that other thing when when it just not social impact investing or he sort of like judging thing that do or political theory then really enjoy the conversations that we have but don't know so it weird so it like sometimes i'm like don't know if this is what want if this is what don't want if i'm just kind of forcing myself or if i'm finding excuses why not to like him don't know don't know so my day today was actually pretty good um woke up and went to breakfast with one of my friends and we was just talking and um about people in both of my lives um and then we went my separate ways to go do homework and she had final that she was doing um and then was alone and finished all my stuff and then went and ate dinner outside with my two friends and then we went and we bought bunch of snacks and then came back and um smoked with one of that friends from dinner um the guy that i've been seeing or sort of been seeing came over um we started cuddling and making out and stuff but was like just want to [inaudible] so yeah but he here and his [brother is picking him up] had really nice day today um woke up with the guy who spent the night last night um he super nice but did not sleep well because my bed is [inaudible] and he large boy not like fat or anything he just like tall he was on the track team so he kinda muscular too which is pretty nice um and then went to get brunch with my friends my last brunch as freshmen it was little sad um and he also [redacted] was eating with us it was nice and talked to my sister just texted my sister and was like you know sure like him but don't really know what to do about it and she like you know what and especially because it the end of the semester she kinda like live your life let him live his life because it not fair for either of you to do anything over the summer and then also you know you you're just kind of like in the heat of things right now you're not gonna wanna be in relationship with him i'm like you know what that true because sometimes i'm like hmm like this boy and then other times i'm like hmm really do like this boy but so far it been like him well like for today and also yesterday and let see what else he edited my gov 10 things which was really nice and it wasn't like lot of edits but he was like work on this work on this so just finished all of that edits which is good um and went to the park with um like good amount of the people in my orchestra um so and that was like really fun and we did stuff for ideas for next semester which was really great really fun um and watched some tv with some friends i'd pretty good day today um went to breakfast then went to work and had good conversation with uh oth my other coworker that work with and um we just had like good conversation about like friends and mental health and it was good that feeling we're both kinda at part where we're working to listen to each other but then also working like we we feel comfortable talking to each other about my problems but then we're also making sure we're backing up and asking the other person about their th about their life and stuff so feel like that good and that going somewhere and then after that went to lunch with few of my blocking my block mates it didn't invite me just ran into them and it was like join me so was like all right um and then was alone for like good portion of the day just because was um packing so now all of my stuff that needs to be put away st in storage is in box just needs to go buy more tape um but then and then went to like late work dinner thing but smoked beforehand with my coworker it was great and we had like really good time feel like it was good bonding moment um like think we're definitely good friends think i'm just kind of awkward and and bad at making new friends but you know we'll get over that and um then um oh got an email back from the nonprofit person and it asked me to come in for an interview tomorrow um but we haven't scheduled the time yet so i'm like don't fucking know what we're gonna be doing um but i'm like little nervous so needs to like start looking up at stuff 'cause hopefully it'll don't wanna sound like dumb person so today was like weird went to work and was having chill time just 'cause it was work and there like nothing going on and talked to my advisor little bit um and he was like yeah think you should join social club which was like felt good that don't know felt like weird that somebody like him would tell me to do that just because it his job to like get rid of [final] club and stuff like that but then also at the same time he like but join recognized one so that so he like is just wants to make sure that they're like safe spaces for that they're just safe and like not bad which totally make sense and then after that went and dropped off my wristband and then went to bring all of my stuff to storage today which was great with one of my friends one of my blockmates she came and helped me so that was nice and then and then had my phone interview which that went really really well so i'm very pleased with that hopefully i'll hear back from him tomorrow that what it said it was like maybe tomorrow 'cause we have meeting with somebody in like [pdha] or something but whatever um so hopefully it will get back to me soon and then also got this really annoying text the dude from new york texted me he was like you know i'm kind of frustrated because thought that would be seeing you every morning and every night since i've been here and i'm like don't know where you got that from because one i'm in finals this is my finals week so i'm not gonna be with anybody every morning or every night like that just stupid and two you said that you was also coming for week to see your friends so don't know why you expected that was going to dominate your time and don't know why you expected that would like move my schedule around to hang out with you like have things that actually need to do so that dumb and was like i'm sorry that didn't tell you that was going to be busy during the busiest week of school but whatever and was like but we do need to have conversation about my relationship because we is not on the same page with anything um but we're going to hang out tomorrow which will probably be the last time see him because also i'm ev ever since that conversation i've just kind of been irritated with him so think just need to be like yo this isn't don't know what you wants but it not gonna work out that maybe we can see each other when one of me comes into town somewhere and like on we can be friends if you wants but don't think like this is fair to me the way that you is like treating me you're saying that there like un unequal that there like inequitable um emotional energy being emotional labor putting being put in i'm like but we agreed that you weren't that you weren't gonna do anything for me but now you're saying that you're doing everything when i'm doing nothing when i'm like we agreed that we is not going to be emotionally connected like this like am people is just dumb they're just dumb dumb dumb so today was um it getting weird went to work and it was like actually really really busy at [inaudible] was getting stressed out because there so much going on at once it like don't have can't do this there like way too much but all finished and it was all good and then was getting ready to go to the park to go meet the dude from new york was like you know what don't wanna go don't wanna walk for 40 minutes see this dude that don't actually really wanna see so then didn't texted him he was like think just need to take break and like not talk for while so like figure out what going on with this relationship like all right you do you i'm just gonna stay here and not talk to you as kind of want the this to be right now um so when he comes back i'm just gonna be like you know what this isn't gonna work maybe he'll be on the same page so whatever and went and got my hair cut which was good and it was really cool um and then uh um don't know it fel it felt just like chill day of doing homework and went to get dinner with one of my senior friends who in my orchestra it was really good to see her and hopefully i'll see her again like in the summer the next year 'cause she'll be she will be in the area um and then studied for my [inaudible] final with my friends which was like sort of productive that one finished so i'm there just few more like editing thing to do like need to actually present my practice presentation um yeah so i'm like kind of stressed about everything but i'm trying not to be so today was really really stressful day um woke up and went to breakfast and then went to work and work was like nice and calm so it was really good uh didn't actually have time to do much homework or studying but it was all right got to design some shirts and backpacks and hats that was [nearby] for the office so that was fun um and then the dude that i'd sort of had thing with like came into the office to say hi to me and like the assisted dude who work in the suite with me and my advisor came out of the office and then it was like there when he when he came in so it saw me interacting and then later it was like interrogating me about him dunno kind of like him but my advisor thinks that he just trying to play the the long con to hook up with me but we'll see my other friend just thinks that he emotionally unstable which it could be both um but then went to get some food with one of my block mates and and when we go got we went to get some boxes and then finished editing the novella and came back and started packing up the like the temporary storage boxes so all of my clothes are put away um everything that need in temporary storage would be in there and so i'm on only have to deal with the clothes that i'm wearing uh that was wearing today and then i'll [inaudible] and should be good i'm still really stressed even though shouldn't be so today was an extremely stressful day just because had to move out and also take all my finals um but woke up and ate breakfast with one of my friends for the last time for this semester of this year and then we also got lunch together but it was sad but also kind of funny um my presentation went really really well and think my finals also went pretty well lost my id today though my student id while was bringing my stuff temporary storage so then had to go and buy new one um but i'm glad that i'm back home because now don't have to worry about anything and it summer and school over so today mainly stayed just with my family um it was my mom graduation she got her master um yeah so we just did like family stuff today and we was just like getting ready and did lot of reading um almost all of my book only have like 40 pages so hopefully i'll get that finished tomorrow but my room is mess right now it kind of stressing me out we had like [inaudible] um we had like sort of dinner party thing for her graduation um so my like neighbors came and my family friends came and so that was like really nice that was really the only social experience that i've had all of my friends is still college so i'm here until tuesday i'm just gonna be with family and mean and just like stayed around the house doing like nothing just reading and watching tv so today was pretty boring day um what wasn't that boring went to brunch with my family for mother day and oh no woke up and my face was so swollen um so we went to urgent care they gave me some antibiotics finished my book just watched some tv didn't really do much um um was feeling kinda bad just because like was going on instagram and stuff and looking at all of these attractive people and like um some of the other guys at like [redacted] who just like don't talk to me was just making me feel bad um and dudes just love to leave me on red and right now they sucks makes me mad again today didn't do much well actually that lie kind of did more than did before went to the psychiatrist and got refills of my medication and we were supposed to do this thing where would get extra pills because of i'm going on vacation overseas but the insurance company is being dumb so my mom just gonna pick it up for me later um and then also um went to the ther my therapist and that were great to catch up with her and we talked about some friends and stuff with school and what else got my eyebrows done and went to the restaurant here where used to work so it were nice to see all my coworkers and stuff um yeah and read some of my book oh were on social media and were feeling kind of bad about myself just because of like how my body looks and stuff so that kinda sucks just wish my legs were bigger so today was uh pretty good day um we woke up got on another flight and now we're at like our final destination um and then we met up with one of the other professors who with two of the other professors who are with us one of them are staying in the same apartment as us um so it was nice to go out with all all of us and see so many other than just our dad um but still not lot of interactions with people we don't have any wi-fi so that really sucks but right now but hopefully the wi-fi will be back tomorrow um don't know i've kind of been trying not to think about men especially that dude from [inaudible] but kinda had this realization was like you know we don't talk that much because we're not really friends like we only met once and don't know why i'm freaking out about that because don't don't know what expect any normal people to to be like it just don't know it it feels weird like them but also at the same time like do even like them don't even know [inaudible] mainly texted them today was good but it was also kind of sucky got all of my grades back and i'm really happy about my grades for this semester so that good um but then was just kind of feeling stressed out [inaudible] have this like infected hair follicle thing on my face that just stressing me out and it making me like anxious about how people are looking at me and i'm nervous from meeting people because i've got this gross thing on my face and don't know i've just been feeling self-critical like really self-critical for some reason which kind of sucks um because don't know where that coming from or why i'm feeling that way think it just because i'm afraid of everybody judging me even though really shouldn't care because i'm in foreign country so who you know gives fuck what other people think like [inaudible] and don't know feel weird like i'm happy that i'm here i'm really excited to be here but then also miss all my friends at home and just like had moments where just really wanna be alone but then also don't wanna be alone so it weird um think like i've been bringing around my anxiety medication haven't been taking anything so tomorrow might take one and see like how it works how it makes me feel today wasn't the best day um like woke up was with my dad and his coworker and stuff and we was just like walking around and shopping today but today was the day when my dad like really like start to visibly get stressed out about spending money which is just so irritating to me like you know he doesn't want me spending so much money but every single like dollar that he counting and i'm like you need to calm down it the the fourth day doesn't know how you're thinking that you're gonna be here for 40 more day if this is like what it gonna be went to movie and that was nice and then dinner but after the movie was just kind of like in one of that moods where i'm just not talking at all and did really wanted some alone time today and my face is still disgusting but if it not better on monday then will be going to the doctor today had more interactions it was mainly my dad and his coworker friend for the majority of the day and then we went to orientation for his um for the study abroad program thing and talked to more law students and um so talked to like good amount of them which was cool guess um and then we went to museum which was like fun-ish my dad was still frustrating when it came to like money because he like didn't buy me lunch and we didn't have any food at the apartment so didn't eat lunch today because my dad is obsessing about spending money so today was kinda cool went it was the first day of classes for my dad and his coworker went to his coworker classes it was like comparative criminal law classes and it was really cool and yeah sat in for that participated in the slightest bit but more than other people even though it was just like the first day but it it wasn't anything though um and went to the doctor and it gave me some more antibiotics and some stuff to put on it so hopefully this like huge infected thing will go away this huge bump would just go away soon um and then just had some time alone in the apartment where was reading and took nice [long] nap which was great um and then we went out to dinner with me my dad and then his three coworker so the one staying with me and two other women and then we went to dinner and uh we was having like good time um but then we like started talking about like family stuff and one of them like got kinda heavy with the one women who um used to be mormon but now she not anymore so that was like kinda heavy but then it was all talking about like family issue stuff and was like oh ha ha my dad is right here and so we almost got into little spat though at the very end when he was obsessing about money again and dunno told my sister about it and maybe i'll tell my mom so that can just like have be like dad is freaking out can you just hint them to to calm down make sure that he not stressing out because it getting extremely frustrating so had really fun day today um first went to class and was sort of participating but not really as much as wanted to it was just because it was doing lot of like actual legal law stuff that couldn't really follow but then we came home and we went out and got some fried food that was really good for lunch but the wi-fi started worked downloaded tinder and grindr and and ended up meeting up with this one dude who 21 he 21 and he is interning at the consulate and he goes to columbia um so we hang out today it was nice but you know my bpd ways was kicking in and i'm like obsessed with him now but need to chill out because it just like four-week friend basically so today was kind of weird it was good day but i'm not feeling the best right now woke up late got ready on my own time then went to the [uffizi] museum with my dad and the law school students but was starting to get stressed out so took my um anxiety medication beforehand and it helped so was was calm and then we went around and window-shopped and we tried on bunch of glasses that was really cool um and we went to dinner and then ended up going to dinner again with the guy that met yesterday and we had really fun time just eating and chatting and walking and then made the foolish mistake of messaging him saying hey um so you can say no if you want to 'cause you may not wanna hang out with me every single day but hmm basically have to eat by myself tomorrow so was like we could um cook food together tomorrow if you want and he was like huh yeah i'll let you know he was doing it in nice way but that definitely means that he doesn't want to so now feel sad and like before that just convinced myself to be hedonistic and do whatever want that makes me feel happy and not worry about anything in the long-term but then didn't even think about the short-term so short-term and long-term it doesn't feel good for me so today was good day but also kind of boring day started off with me waking up um just like yeah getting up late then went to lunch just like sandwich place with my dad and his co-worker and we ended up going shopping and got these really really nice shoes but they're kind of expensive but you know they're an investment and but they're really really cool i'm very happy got them um originally 450 but brought them down to 200 that just because only had 200 in cash and they was like sure we'll take they um and [inaudible] what else then came back and did an reading and then went out and met my dad and we went out to dinner like really late but the only issue is that these like dude that i've been talking to we was like talking but don't know these feels weird think just need to ask them like what they wants while they here because we could be feeling something completely different don't really know what wants kinda just wants like dates so was having good day today um up until like couple of hours ago um went out to lunch with one of the law students and he was kinda boring but it was okay and then ended up hooking up with this one dude which it was nice and it was fun and it was had good time and i'm not like obsessed about him or don't hate myself afterwards so that always good sign and then um we was going to this gala thing for the law school it should've been fun it started out really fun where was like mingling with everybody and the other students and then my dumbass thought that it was good idea to log on to wi-fi and the dude that met here um messaged me and he was like oh yeah [inaudible] i'm going to get some drinks with this one dude tonight and for some reason that just ruined my night and don't know i'm just like sad this feels weird 'cause feels like i'm obsessed with him don't like that feeling and don't know how to not feels that way and so i'm also like mad at myself for feeling that way because i'm just like overreacting about everything that don't even matter i'm just crazy person so today was like mix between really good day and not really bad day but just not great day so um woke up was still feeling like kind of sad [inaudible] um you know it was just like weird was just in weird emotional state um but then we went on day trip to like another little [redacted] town um and we actually missed our stop so we ended ended up getting off at different little town but we only kind of [inaudible] lunch there but it was nice like little beach town so that was fun excursion just like random thing that was nice that nobody was really planning on but nobody was mad about and then we went to the town where we was supposed to go and then we had just nice chill time so really nothing about that was bad and one of the professors that we was with though she was just being really annoying don't know she just like just trying to prove herself she just wants um she like wants everything to be about her think she does have some like stuff that she does need to work on but still it just gets frustrating for everybody else and then we got back late at around midnight but then went out to look at drinks with this one with that dude and well like we was walking around we was having good time bought myself pizza we got some drinks we drank it by the um big church which was super fun but then when we start walking back we was walking back to his apartment and then probably when we got like halfway to between our apartment was like um so am coming back to your apartment with you what the sitch and he was like what time is it and was like it 230 am and he was like um nope you're i'm going uh to bed and was like all right which part of me is like happy about because know in it he was just like [inaudible] as he was thinking maybe it could happen if it wasn't too late but don't know but then also like probably should not be having sex right now just because i'm not in very good emotional state um but also like obviously it don't feel good to be curved like that so i'm confused as to um how feel right now so today was um it was start off as bad day just woke up and was like kinda sad was really tired but we finished my book and we went out to like late lunch and my dad did some shopping but then got back and um the dude messaged me and we was like he was like i'm just just looking for friend just got out of like relationship three weeks ago and i'm like hmm all right i'm like fine whatever the [inaudible] even though that know you had sex with somebody like two nights ago but still it whatever but it is probably best just for me um to not worry about that with him um i'm feeling better about that and i'm just trying to be hedonistic but also went to the gym which was really really nice today was pretty good day woke up told myself was gonna get up at reasonable time but really didn't get up until like 1130 that okay um but went out to lunch with my dad and went back to the doctor and they said just keep doing what i'm doing with my face so hopefully they won't be terrible by next week but they said if they still is there at all then they gonna open they up and um then after lunch came back and was just hanging around for little bit and then went and hung out with my new friend and they was nice we was supposed to go to the [redacted] or we was supposed to go to garden here um but they was closed so then we went and we got some gelato instead and walked around some other piazza and and then we got some drinks and they was they was really nice time they was fun and we did talk about like different dudes in my lives not like us hooking up with people because you know really don't like talking about sex with other people especially with other guys that just like makes us feel icky especially if once did wanna hook up with that people um but anyways we was like talking about sex and like us with some of the dudes that i'm like sort of talking to guess and feel like that was good that we could have that sort of like friendship talk that made they like less sexual guess but then was like walking home and for some reason was getting angry don't really know what was going on then went to dinner with my dad and all of his coworkers and they they we went to like this chinese restaurant and there was so many people there everything was moving so fast and was just like getting so irritated so was glad when we left um but then some dudes from grindr added us on snapchat and they was sending us bunch of snaps and they like you're so cute blah blah blah blah blah so that did makes us feel better so now am starting to feel better than so today um had good day woke up did um the last bit of like [grading] things for my [dad's] [inaudible] so hopefully i'll get paid soon then went to the school to meet with my dad we ate some lunch and then we like sort of went shopping around and just went to the leather store and figured out the bag that wanted to buy um it super super cool so that fun and then um met up with this one dude he studying at [redacted] here he year younger than me but we walked around and we got some drinks it was fun and so he wants to see each other again so we probably will um and then my other friend that i've been hanging out with before he messaged me and he was like hey let hang out this weekend so it made me feel good that he was asking me to hang out it wasn't just me asking him to hang all the time but i'm not gonna be here this weekend um so we'll hang out sometime next week or whatever um and de de de de do do do do do do do do do well i'll oh

she thought that this man was following her but then she started bringing up how he like black man and was like ooh here is this is where we have an issue and so was like pissed about that for for the whole day which is fine so then we went and we worked out felt good came back to the apartment and just did an reading ate an food but then the wi-fi went out so was getting pissed because of that and then we went shopping and then we came back and then did little bit more reading and went out to dinner with other professors and two other students and the dinner was nice and it was fun but then on the way back like talked to this woman and was like yo you was being racist and she was getting so defensive and stuff and like naturally but mean feel better because don't want her to have this thing where she thinks that she 100 right all the time when she herself is offensive and she was like just don't unders she just like just thinks it important for race to be brought up in this sense because blah blah blah i'm like no no no no no she [inaudible] like sh don't even wanna like get into it but basically she was bringing race into the she was bringing race into thing where she was trying to like make it about her and how it problem for her to thinks about it like this but i'm like it is problem for you because it problematic anyways but told her was like yo you know what you're doing is

those class went back to the library and studied more and those like basically all those do in my time is those study like don't really on weekdays like talk to people those often because just try to do um all of my homework as far in advance as humanly possible um which was not too successful today because was very distracted or not wasn't very distracted but like my reading for li for one of my class today was like pretty boring and like also kind of confusing so didn't want to read it those much but um after those we had like entryway meeting stuff and like entryway study breaks and just sat in the basement um from like literally 900 pm until like 1130 almost and before going back to my room was just talking to people and like eating pizza just love free food so much um so it was great day overall fantastic day actually even though didn't finish all my homework 'cause finished most of my homework and the rest of my homework is due on like tuesday so it don't even matter um thank you good night okay so today it is thursday so had class um so went to my class and in between oh my god in between my class like did some studying and also went to lunch with two friends which was nice um we have we have like class in the afternoon together so we started getting lunch together which is really nice really like them really lot really lot and um then after that got into the club that [compt] and was so happy like was walking with someone and like grabbed his arm and like like hurt them like didn't hurt them that way much but like slapped them and like like was like got in and was so happy like um thought was gonna cry and it was so great and then after that like went to like the studied for hours um ended up skipping dinner because was studying and because make bad life choices and but was studying at place that was really nice it was like it had like bunch of um classrooms in it that was just open so just kept moving from classrooms to classrooms because there was actual class going on and people would come in and they'd be like uh is you here for class and i'd be like no sorry will just leave um and then after that think went went to so the club that [compt] it had social for the people who got in and went to it and was like yay we're in we went to social and it like came and got us and um and it took us to house it like we went around and got and we was like introducing each other to each other and it had things to drink many things to drink and had many things to drink and it is 100 am 120 to be exact and have class at 1100 am and don't think that am drunk but think that if took blood alcohol test would not get passing score so all in all it was great day and i'm going to bed now good night okay so today felt pretty sick um i'm going to concede to the opinions of my friends and say that was drunk on thursday night so woke up on friday morning um like kind of hungover like my head hurt really bad and just felt weird and funny and my throat really hurt and was also losing my voice today don't think it don't sound as bad anymore so hopefully i'm not really losing it but um so felt terrible got up went to section barely listened not that there was much to listen to and spent uh large oh and after went to section so my section was from like 1100 am to 1200 pm so woke up woke up showered ate bag of potato chips for breakfast went to section and then came back to my dorm room and slept for three hours because got terrible night sleep last night fell asleep at 200 am woke up at 400 am for no fucking reason and then couldn't fall back asleep until like past 630 like watched the sun rise from my bed and it it it it made me angry and then fell back asleep like at 630 and slept to like 900 so was super tired um uh but um so like didn't feel that great today but did spend lot of time with one of my roommates um she roommates that don't usually see that much because usually she gone lot uh but she went to breakfast with me my breakfast being bag of potato chips that bought in vending machine from library and after section after my nap actually we went to dinner together and we went to the library together and did not do any studying at the library she was being productive was on my phone the whole time doing literally nothing really just didn't feel like motivated to do anything today and think it because of how not good felt at the beginning of the day it just like set up my whole day for failure um but yeah but it not like had to do anything really because do most of my homework so far in advance that i'm never really behind can afford to miss day and um was going to go to party tonight with friends but decided to skip it so that could be reasonable and productive human being because have no impulse control and know that if went to another party would get just as drunk or more drunk would get as drunk as possible basically that how roll um so that would not be good for my life tomorrow and can afford to miss one day of homework but cannot afford to miss two um uh but um another thing today so yeah did not feel good today but another thing that was good today is that me and my friends from back home um skyped we was on skype for three hou well we was like talking on skype for one hours and then me and one of my friends who did not leave she didn't have anywhere to like two of them had to leave for school-related thing but the other one who didn't have to leave we um like shared screens on skype and um and watched netflix together for like two more hours and just love my friends very much and miss them and love them very much so that was really really nice so even though like wasn't really um that productive and felt kind of sick this morning would say it was still good day like still um enjoyed it or still enjoy uh guess now i'm ha now i'm in good mood because don't feel sick anymore and facetimed my friends but it still good day every day is good day as long as you're alive at some point felt was going to die from alcohol poisoning and that didn't happen so it great day okay so hope you can hear me there is fan going so today woke up at like ten laid in bed for like an hour and then washed my hair which [inaudible] and went to lunch and there were friends at lunch don't don't really have terrible memory so don't really know if went to lunch with someone or if met someone

expand lot and then finally put it into french and then will just have to retype it i'll just type it up tomorrow and then hopefully like it'll be good enough that can be done or at least done for the

same taste in music as me which is nice um and yeah now i'm home i'm go was should like don't wanna stay up and do homework anymore because i'm sleepy and lazy so think i'll just wake up little earlier than normal 'cause did sleep in the car got probably like two hours of sleep in the car so or maybe like mean it was interrupted two hours but two-ish hours maybe more so if get like five hours now probably like seven hours of sleep then should be able to wake up little earlier than usual and do our homework which would be really nice and helpful and then have our fi have our finals for abnormal psychology on thursday and i'm not really worried about it because feel like i'm gonna do fine but didn't have not finished studying really or at least not as much as should have and now because did no homework this weekend have lot of shit to do before can start studying for our finals which is not good because it monday and the finals on tuesday but you know this is life this is how

okay so today um was great day woke up early today so was like not rushing or anything today then went to linguistics had to ask my linguistics professor for letter of like reference for that study abroad program because technically they're like okay it uh don't need to explain it it don't matter but had to ask her and she like immediately sent it today like she was so on top of things which was so grateful for and after linguistics um think went what day is it wednesday oh after linguistics started applying for scholarships because need scholarships to do this um this you know this things that i'm doing the study abroad program in france i'm going to need some money um so applied for bunch of scholarships that was basically what did from like linguistics until the life project then

stuff and we was having like like just get along with her so well and love her so much she like so smart so like so like passionate about things and like don't know just feel like being around people like that makes me better people you makes like being around like like good company breeds good company basically um so we had like like lot of we like was not being super productive mostly because i'm easily distracted um but we had some like very interesting talks we was talking about um gun control laws and like we both had the same point of view but she very good at looking at things from the other point of view from from coming up with reasons why people think what it think even if cannot possibly imagine why it think that way and think that is some incredible some incredible trait to have some incredibly enlightening um ability to have to be able to say like and like can do that with some things but she do it lot better to just be able to like look at something and say this is what think and am am steadfast in my beliefs but but here is my explanation for why people who think something other than what think um for why it think that and understand why it think that and understand where it is coming from and think it just it just makes you better people when you're able to do that because you're more understanding of people opinions and you're feel like your more able to communicate with her and work with her it just really good um so anyway my day was fantastic 10 out of 10 am going to bed now i'm actually going to watch youtube video that my friends sent me

wake up at like earlier like 1100 at the latest but whatever they still cool still had fun still did my homework used to be stressed about my homework 'cause thought wouldn't have enough time to do all my homework but do have enough time so i'm not stressed anymore and yeah i'm going to um i'm gonna go to bed [laughter] i'm going back to my dorm right now and i'm gonna go to bed good night um okay so woke up today at like 1130 am and immediately did not feel good like my throat was hurting my head kind of hurt don't know it was feel like don't know it just felt weird and tired and kind of cold and went to in went to the dining hall but didn't really eat 'cause wasn't really hungry didn't really feel well just sort of sat and listened to the news um and then went to the library and was so tired that fell asleep slept for like an hour and then did an homework and then had to get up and go to work and while was at work just sat on my phone the whole time not the whole time but part of the time lot of the time half of the time and felt really uncomfortable 'cause like think my hair was in bun that was just like too tight and it was making my head hurt and it was just adding to the badness and then the the library that was working at was really super cold like so cold that my hands [trembled] um also woke up this morning on my period and like that not even fair 'cause got my period two weeks ago less than two weeks ago so don't know what going on there but walked home from work and it was raining and didn't have an umbrella so just got drenched and was so cold and so tired that just laid in my wet clothing on the bed and slept for like an hour and then that was like woke up at like o'clock and did my homework until like 1000 and then realized my head was hurting now because had taken out the bun but hadn't really eaten anything like just ate that like half-ass lunch so just went down and bought myself um dinner like from the vending machine so not really dinner like snacks like macaroni and fruit snacks um and yeah um should probably do my french homework should probably uh prep for debate but think i'm just gonna take nap no think i'm gonna go to bed think like don't feel good because one i'm super tired because i've just been partying lot every day and like going to bed like super late and waking up like after only like five six hour of wait how many six hour of sleep maybe but that like not lot for me and um yeah so i'm just gonna go to sleep and will feel better in the morning it was like not all bad day like listened to an music and it made me feel better ran into my friend in the street and it made me feel lot better ran into my other friend downstairs and that made me feel better and like my nap in the library made me feel better so it not all bad it like mean it was like okay it was like not great but it was not terrible and when wake up tomorrow will be fully rested and ready for the day and everything will be great good night okay so last oh i'm losing my voice last night went to bed at like 1130 pm so woke up super well-rested today it was really great not great woke up without voice that unfortunate um i'm still kind of losing my voice but hopefully if just drink enough wattle water that'll stop happening um so yeah what else was gonna say um [laughter] yeah um went to class have two class today in between that two class went to the lab for this to get new watch and then ate lunch with friends socialized um that was nice actually ate lunch today so that was good um and then after my second class came back took nap was actually had like headache this morning like all through this morning and early afternoon had headache then was sleepy even though wo got lot of sleep so came back and took nap and then after that felt better so it was great and then after that did like just prepped for debate for the rest of the evening and then did tiny bit of studying for linguistics but besides that just prepped for debate um so yeah prepping for debate could've gone better like did it kinda really slowly and kept like getting distracted taking breaks but like that okay it not till friday anyway who cares [so then] can do it on like thursday night what day is it tuesday the only thing that i'm even slight i'm not really stressed at all but the only thing that i'm even slightly worried about is the fact that have my midterm next tuesday and feel like haven't studied for it really and um i'm also gonna be gone all weekend 'cause of debate and don't know when my french midterm is [at all like] at all and also my midterm it not on tuesday it on monday so that great um yeah but i'm sure i'll be fine think the class is like pretty easy understand [it pretty well] just need to like re go over my notes and maybe maybe go over the powerpoints then should be pretty fine um so yeah that it um good night um well i'm not going to bed yet i'm gonna go prep for debate for like maybe like half an hour more and then i'm gonna go to sleep um so yeah good night in half an hour okay so today my voice sounds rude today woke up had class went to class enjoy my class we watched movie in linguistics today oh that looks weird um after linguistics went to some office hours then went back to my dorm and laid in bed no no no no didn't that lie went to lunch met up with some friends um yeah ate lunch figured out how to get into the dining hall when it outside of lunch hours [inaudible] which is secret that just did not know um um and then went back to my dorm and was like i'm gonna prep for debate and then just laid in bed and read the news for some hours and half before going to my next class which was also interesting [inaudible] talked about us or big project that we're doing like next month and how need to get like grip on reality and need to like start working or like not start working but like start thinking of better plan um and then after that class went back to my dorm meant to prep for debate instead got emailed the thing about the study abroad that applied for um so was like filling out more of that thing um applying for more scholarships really need to find way to pay for this crap um and then yeah then went to work had work and then after work also went to like the dea the freshman dean house for like dinner because it was holding like dinner thing that was fun and then after went to um work and then after work went to um debate practice round which was lot of fun love the people in debate like feel like love the people in debate more than love debate like if it was actual people that didn't love would just hate it completely but because love the people in it love it um and then after the debate went to the dining hall to get more food specifically cake and now i'm back in my room just finished my french homework am like i'm not behind in any homework because i'm never behind in homework because of who am as people but feel like am significantly more behind in homework than would be if was not so focused on debate do debate in all of my free time now instead of working harder on my homework um which is like kinda not good because have like midterms but like also c'est la vie um and think it all it gonna be fine um next week will not be going to debate tournament so think i'm just going to next week work super far ahead for all of my class so that can hopefully um like just like like in the upcoming in the second half of the semester in general be so far ahead that don't have to be as worried as am i'm still not really very worried because just don't worry in general really usually but like mean like it would be nice to know that don't need to like stay up late to finish my homework ever because it already done two week in advance which is what it usually is um so yeah that [inaudible] that was just like us rambling my own thoughts out loud this is really like some audio diary um also i'm losing my voice kind of which makes us little nervous for debate um but yeah my whole life is just centered around debate right now good night okay so today um woke up had don't even know had class [inaudible] had french class had linguistics class no didn't that lie had french class had abnormal psychology um so that are fun and then um in between them think went back to my dorm don't remember what do [inaudible] every day blur it hard to remember but went um to um after ab psych went to the office of career services to try and find out if can get funding for my my my winter study abroad program and it were like yeah that not offered for winter program which are really sad so need to find out way to pay for this study abroad program because really really want to go and it would be really really sad if weren't able to go just because of money um so yeah um and then yeah after that went and prepped for debate and then had debate practice round which were fun and after the debate practice round went to like study little bit barely really don't even do homework anymore just prep for debate and i'm sad all the time no i'm not i'm not actually sad but i'm not feeling good right now because it 300 in the morning and would like to go to sleep but can't go to sleep because the fucking laundry machine don't fucking work and it got my clothes soaking wet and so now have to put them in the dryer like five time which are really fucking annoying but yeah um other than that my day were pretty good um i'm really tired though wish could be asleep right now and i'm not may might just go to sleep and leave my clothes in the dyer and like get them in the morning but don't wanna do that um anyway that all good night okay so today got three hours of sleep because the um washing machine and [inaudible] was broken and like

were always centered around alcohol and you know drank lot of different things and then ate because were really drunk ate like some [inaudible] at um like like when we went to dinner together or guess like late night dinner whatever and ha obviously have not eaten meat in very long time i'm vegetarian so the combination of like all the alcohol that still felt like it were like kind of in our body

sleep now goodnight um so had good day today it was really lazy day today because had no finals and had no work so first of all since was [inaudible] like things for my friends until like 400 am last night so slept until like 1230 and then like didn't leave my dorm for most of the day didn't even shower for most of the day um just laid in my bed did some semi-productive things feel like fake productive things in my bed and um we learned that me and my suite mates learned that we're getting new roommate which we was upset about at first but now we learned that it actually one of my friends who in my entryway so like it kind of sad that she losing her single because she like having single but this is like the best way it could have happened so we was really excited about that like we like we screamed like yay when my proctor told me like except in less cheesy-sounding way um yeah and then uh later today like uh uh like four hours ago or something went to someone house to have sex and that what did and then felt high for the first time in my whole life um like we it gave me lot of stuff but it didn't feel too high it felt it felt like don't know what being high feel like but it felt kind of the same as being drunk which is fine um and yeah and it was really nice it was really fun really enjoyed it and then when got back my friends [redacted] made me go to the university health services to go get like plan-b things or whatever which like mean understand his concern but i'm not concerned um and would have preferred to sleep tbh but it whatever um yeah but i'm gonna go to sleep now have to wake up in four hours for work so hopefully go to sleep in time and goodnight okay almost forgot to do this because i'm really really tired because got like four or five hours of sleep last night but it okay um and then like went to work this morning after work came back and would have preferred to go back to sleep but instead um started since my roommates decided to move my rooms around we started moving my rooms or started moving my rooms and that what did that what spent most of the day doing moved my rooms and also had to uh go online to be part of the like live orientation program for my study abroad program which am so freaking excited for like i'm so excited like was excited before but like now it feels like really really real and i'm so excited um yeah and then went to like went to like lunch slash dinner at some point with like friends just to be or no not dinner lunch to be like 'cause was giving my friends some cards that made for them for christmas um and then spent most of the day um just moving my rooms around yeah and it was like i'm now in the single and it very very nice it looked really really small before because my suitemate that was in it before had so much stuff but with my stuff because don't have lot of stuff it looks pretty big and really really like it could like live here the only thing i'm like almost worried about is like actually like me spending too much time in here and like not being social but i'm sure it'll be okay so um i'm gonna go to bed now good night okay so again with the not having productive days the trend because i'm going to [inaudible] ah dropped something um uh [inaudible] so like have list of things need to do over winter break specifically before like uh january 1st january 2nd or something um but i've just not been doing it lately and like know that like just finished finals and maybe should relax and like have you know like all of winter break but still feel like still kind of feel bad when don't do the things want to do so have not really ouch ouch started prepping for debate but didn't get far and tried to start my applications for summer study abroad programs but also didn't get far but that was not really my fault that was the fault of the applications it was being shitty um yeah and like did lot of nothing today like just slept for long time think even though di went to bed really early still slept for long time and um chilled in bed for long time which was nice and relaxing basically saw no one today except for my roommate [redacted] and like my friend who passed once in the streets um yeah and now i'm gonna go lay down and pretend that have earned the right to like go to bed and relax even though clearly haven't because i've done nothing productive today actually that lie i've done some productive things don't really remember all of the produce things did but i'm sure it exist um anyway um i'm gonna go to bed now and think i'm gonna set my alarm so that wake up earlyish tomorrow because would like to get actual things done goodnight okay so today you know feel like feel like i've regressed today but also feel like am doing work 'cause like did do okay so put down didn't study or anything today 'cause i'm not technically doing any schoolwork lately but like prepping for debate i'm supposed to be like practicing languages which have not been doing over break but like today actually did things but surprisingly still feel unproductive for some reason and mean didn't spend the whole day doing things spent maybe like five hours doing things but still feel like that lot when i'm also spending you know 16 hours asleep every day um and so don't know but don't know feel like should be doing more than am but then feel like that unjustified consi like some unjustified feeling considering that have um like it winter break and have the whole week that i'll be home you know before like my study abroad trip anyway don't know that just how i'm feeling um have not started packing even though i'm leaving tomorrow technically tuesday morning um and haven't just have like things little tiny things that need to do to be ready for life and just don't feel like doing them feel less motivated to do little tiny things than do to do like large endeavors like had to text someone today to like ask them to write me letter of re-recommendation it took me like hours to just like build up the energy to text them but was also like prepping for debate all like for several hours and do you know how much work prepping for debate is it way more there infinite amount of things to prep for so like why was that why was that priority over like one sending out one text don't know anyway um that just how feeling i'm feeling in general i'm not excited to go home really mean like i'm excited to see my family guess but like just don't wanna get on the plane don't wanna leave so early in the morning on tuesday just wanna lay in my bed just wanna sleep for the rest of my life like why isn't that some option that have okay good night okay so this morning um started off as great start when woke up two hours late yeah like set my alarm because there was stuff wanted to do this morning but accidentally set it for 900 pm instead of 900 so woke up two hours late um was late to my watch switch thing but that okay um then don't really kn like don't know what do all day like went back to my room tried to be productive don't remember really if succeeded or not don't know who cares don't cares made girl who know who love um little postcard thing like the ones that made bunch of my friends and brought it to her today and she was so happy and it was so cute um and then went to work today while was at work made myself bare minimum schedule for um winter break but it like like made myself bare minimum schedule for finals where it like the bare minimum of thing that want to get done of thing that need to get done every day in order to be like not screwed for finals but the bare minimum schedule for for winter break is much less bare minimum because everything that want to do don't have like deadline it just just wanna do her as soon as possible anyway um what else did do oh it it currently 230 am because i'm just gonna stay awake the whole night because my flight leaves at like 500 am think so i'm gonna

care i'm so sleepy besides that besides going to the middle school and giving that two presentation to the speech and debate class um did you know the stuff that i'd scheduled for myself and then spent most of the day just lying in bed um chilling feeling sleepy and hot um i'm about to go to sleep played some sims hang out with my dog took nap on the couch it boring life basically i'm excited to go back to school i'm excited to go to paris i'm supposed to go to paris um think left my glasses at [redacted] which is unfortunate because that mean has to wear contacts all the time and contacts is kind of uncomfortable after too long um i'm sorry i'm sleepy don't know what i'm supposed to be saying wish can't really can't really go on tinder here can't has sex here because you know my brother in the room next door and my mother in the room down the hall wish could i'll has to go two weeks without it which is unfortunate but whatever um good night so did literally nothing today slept until noon and then sat and played the sims until like don't know late 900 maybe don't know don't know what i've been doing no not 900 until like 700 maybe and then watched netflix and then and now i'm here i've done literally nothing nothing productive didn't meet my schedule today didn't meet my bare minimum schedule um guess when you don't have like time limit for when you need to do something bare minimum schedule would really be just like nothing on it but still didn't meet my bare minimum schedule um don't really this is one thing that don't like about being on vacation just do nothing all day have no motivation to do anything just sat in bed at one point moved to the couch and that was it that was my whole day ate macaroni good night um okay so feel like these audio journal things are just gonna be really boring until like um after break because literally don't do anything all day long like woke up and then played the sims for like 12 hours at one point took nap think went to get pedicure and manicure with my mom that was it literally that was it played the sims for like literally 12 hours probably actually don't even know how many hours but at least several many and did literally nothing else um so life are boring i'm going to bed oh geez need these to be longer um uh don't know i've not been feeling like in my sur in survey things put when it was asking questions like how much did you feel angry or blah blah blah or blah blah blah today kept just putting very slightly or not all because literally played sims for 12 hours just like stared at computer screen with blank face and felt nothing all day long so that how my life are going currently goodnight um okay so today was another boring day uh where did almost nothing was slightly more productive than have been the the past two day but not super productive like woke up at like 100 pm think yeah and watched crash course and [inaudible] crash course for like th-three hours and then um did nothing for the rest of the day like watched some youtube um and played sims again do this thing every like couple of months or maybe like once year where just play the sims like nonstop for week straight and this week is this year week and it um kind of annoying because it interferes with the rest of my life but once it passes it should be gone for at least another six months so that'll be nice um yeah did nothing else today i'm gonna go to bed now probably should go should've gone to bed earlier because have to wake up at 830 but it okay we all make mistakes some of us just more than others um so today did nothing productive but did more than i've done lately um unfortunately had to wake up or was forced to wake up early today to go to christmas eve church with my mom and my brother and my uncle [redacted] stop it my dog don't know what he doing um was forced to wake up early to go to christmas eve church don't like church um it was boring and just don't believe any of the stuff that it say and after but after church we went to my mo it like my first seeing my uncle in while so that was nice and after church we went to my grandparent house to see them and that was nice too and then after that when we got home it was like 400 and did nothing for the rest of the day just played sims again think i've finally gotten the sims out of my system know no longer feel des the desire to play the game so that so that good hopefully tomorrow will start being productive contributing member of society once again goodnight know that it 1000 pm and usually go to bed at like 200 or 300 am but i'm just tired like i'm just tired and i'm bored and don't don't wanna play sims anymore but don't really wanna start doing anything else either so i'm just gonna go to bed goodnight um okay so merry christmas um today was woken up by my brother at like 830 and because was mostly asleep said get out and like did not get out of bed so my mom came back an hour later to wake me up and we opened presents then and ate breakfast together um and then went back to sleep because was still really tired um and after woke up watched realized that had [filling out] this survey and thought the slot was like how often did you have you thought one of the questions was how often have you did you use social media today turns out the questions is how of how much did you use social media or the internet guess is the questions and so have been answering like just with social media when really should have been answering with the internet and when consider the internet in it it is quite lot um it always quite lot because spend lot of ti well not always but spend lot of time on like youtube which didn't really consider social media um but realize now that it like yeah do spend lot more time like lot more time should have been inputted into the answer to the questions which will account for in the future i'm sorry for that mistake um so after after woke up today at 100 pm called an family members to say merry christmas um watched youtube found watched this like one video game [that] really really like didn't like just found it today watched video about it today really like it and wanted to know more and so watched whole bunch of youtube video about it that what i've been doing for like the past two hour actually it was like 1100 pm like three seconds ago and suddenly it 245 am and that 'cause was watching that damn youtube video um we also went to dinner party um christmas dinner party slash marriage party guess um which was nice mostly did nothing there after dinner just went and like sat in the corner and continued watching youtube video 'cause really really wanted to know about this video game um yeah that been my whole day think i'm finally ready to stop being bum i'm going to try to do actually productive things tomorrow starting tomorrow um so yeah good night sleep tight don't let the bedbugs bite okay so today had like like actually like mildly productive day um it started off not that way actually um have been worried because i'm scared that being here might like sink into depressive spiral and could feel it happening today when um had list in my head of all the things that could do or like should do instead decided to lay on the ground and stare at the ceiling literally didn't even go on my phone for while just stared at the ceiling um but that okay um eventually convinced myself to get up started filling out study abroad application just have to write like little short essay left and then turn that in and should be all set um and um started unpacking the boxes in my room um my mom moved to new house this summer while was at well after had left for school so i'd never like seen my room or unpacked my room so just started unpacking really the only things brought was like books brought some sentimental things too but not many um yeah so that was that two things was the two productive things did did not start them until like 800 pm but and before that was just like watching youtube listening to music laying on the ground and slowly sinking into depressive spiral but hopefully this bout of productivity have raised me out of this the depressive spiral mean i'm not here for long so can't really get into it right it won't happen also think what helped drag me out of it was well was was also like preparing for my study abroad trip that i'm going on um like think i'm leaving on monday or tuesday for it and so was reading about it and was getting excited again and actually should probably check what day we're meeting and what time because that would be smart um so yeah anyway life is good i'm very very excited it i've not done the things that like set out to do over this short winter break that have like the goals it set up but it don't really matter like who cares like i'm gonna die anyway there always time to do them later goodnight okay so feel like am on roller coaster that only goes up that lie that an overdramatic statement um but i'm feeling better today than felt yesterday and felt better yesterday than have for the rest of the days of the week so feel like i'm just like going up you know i'm no longer feeling like bum or super unproductive um today was procrastinated lot today in the afternoon um basically need to write an essay for my study abroad application thing and haven't written it and literally sat in front of my computer for like seven hours straight i'm not joking seven hours and instead of writing it watched netflix and listened to music and did nothing um so yeah that was unproductive but like got up today showered filled out the [inaudible] with my mom and went to the store two store with my mom like left the house that amazing first time i've done that actually no second time i've done that um so think that was pretty impressive um um and was just i'm feeling accomplished because of that thing hopefully tomorrow will actually finish my will no not hopefully will finish my [inaudible] application tomorrow because have to because on friday wanna watch black mirror black mirror comes out on friday and i'm going to watch it all days long um anyway um yeah it is now almost 300 am i'm going to bed now good night sleep tight don't let the bed bugs bite okay so today my goal was to finish my study abroad application essay actually didn't turn it in but did write the whole thing i'm not gonna turn it in yet because like it done and don't know how to improve it right now but think can make it better so i'll work on it later to improve it more um but just had to finish it so could send it to my french teacher so yeah it the only accomplishment that um i'm really really really wanna do the study abroad program so really really hope get it because wanna go so bad like was looking at pictures today and was getting so excited and so like just having like such feeling of longing because wanna go so bad besides filling out that essay and texting my friends did nothing um today you know watched youtube slept took nap as usual um at one point spent two hours online on royalcaribbeancom uh looking at cruises would like search like 14-day-long cruises and then go and like pick the date wanted to go pick the pick the room i'd be staying in the balcony suite with an ocean view pick how many people would be going with me um and

homework but didn't really um and now i'm going to sleep and all in all it was good day good night okay so today was not as active think as have been in the past three days in [redacted] but that okay was taking you know short little break today my class went to [redacted] which is little town that have big castle that was built by bunch of different kings of france um over the years um and it was huge and it was pretty and it was like just insane it was huge with like so many decorations kind of want to live in castle kind of want to start revolution i'm sorry that didn't make sense um anyway

person house to you know engage in sexual activities um was said that weird because was like what if someone hears me even though realized everyone in this building speaks french um um um what else uh after that it was like almost 500 think and walked around went to like went to view the notre dame um couldn't go inside it was night think it was too late to go inside don't know still haven't been inside and wanna go inside haven't gone inside lot of things because just wanted to sort of explore [redacted] and it sort of almost makes me feel like i'm missing out by not going inside but don't

keep reminding myself that don't need to see all of [redacted] um something my like grandma or not my grandma my grandma like my grandma did tell me this before we went [inaudible] was like when she was when my grandma told me this guess when he would go out with my grandma to [redacted] or on vacation she would always wanna like be out for all 12 hours every day you know walking around and he'd be like it okay you can relax like [redacted] will be here you can come back think need to like understand that feel like like have this very strong sense of like need to do everything that is humanly possible but don't really um so anyway after um like got to the notre dame just walked around for lot saw some um like stores that might go back to went to like the big shopping mall don't really like shopping in foreign countries because don't first of all just don't like spending money in general second of all think it just sort of like waste of time like can do shopping in america and also if buy lot of things in foreign countries then have to pay extra when fly back if my suitcase is like overweight um but yeah um good day all in all even though felt like even though felt bad for waking

am i've just finished my essay that due today because procrastinated again because i'm literally stupid and now i'm going to go to sleep um yeah besides the like procrastinating and the fact that i'm going to get like four and half hours of sleep because procrastinated i'd say life is pretty good and now i'm going to bed good night okay so today was good day actually um skipped class today because just like um stayed up late and finished my essay and then just was not feeling like you know like going to class like waking up early considering what time went to sleep to go to class so decided at like 700 no decided at like almost 800 am was like you know what i'm going back to sleep and don't care and at first was like maybe i'll just show up to class like an hour late like when they start the [tour] but then just ended up not going period um think my after that went and walked around um walked like for pretty long time along like the river went to this place called [la gallette] which

the morning and then we went to the common room and we just sat in the common room doing work together and like um we have new roommate roommate who actually already one of my friends so it was like like she was forced to move into my room for me from her single which she wasn't like happy about but like given that she like that we was already friends with her i'd say it like the best case scenario for her um like sat up for while talking to her sat up for long time talking to some other of my friends and roommate and yeah was also so was feeling nice was also super productive today actually the most productive i've been in long time like read all of my emails my tuition or sorted through all my emails deleted bunch of emails my tuition finally got paid um like planned out which classes i'm gonna go this week emailed like my work to make sure um only have schedule that can actually work um what else did do today and was super productive oh finished my study abroad application turned it in and re and really really wanna do the study abroad and really really hope get it um so yeah if don't get it i'm gonna be super sad um feel like i'll probably get to study abroad but if it if don't get the funding that there is going to be some issue then i'll be super sad and i'll have to apply for different study abroad but yeah um that it so i'm very happy and am now going to do little bit of studying for french and spanish because really need to study that because haven't in while and then i'm gonna go to sleep good night okay so today had really good day think i'm just really really really really happy to be back happy just okay be be back so anyway um today was the beginning of [inaudible] to class today had went to two class one was french one was um linguistics was originally planning to take five class this semester but i've changed my mind think the reason wanted to do five class was because of um was gonna take asl this semester too and didn't wanna take like didn't wanna have half my class be language class and one be [expo] so was gonna take five but decided not to take asl so don't need to take five class so i'm just gonna wait so think i'm gonna take french sign language um [expos] and my freshman seminar and part of the reason that decided to not take four class is 'cause now my schedule will be really like empty and just like like sleeping in like being chill wanna good life you know um anyway and um yeah spent lot of time with people today woke up late um or not late but woke up later than usual because didn't have 'cause have class late now like my earliest class is 1100 now um had like got late lunch went to class went to both my class and then um went um to like the dining hall think um and sat in the dining hall with friends for long time and went to debate meeting then went to um study break for my entryway and it was all fun and good and chill and yeah that like it that and now i'm going to sleep um it is only midnight but i'm feeling super tired um kinda accidentally woke up early for some reason this morning maybe that why um yeah and i'm really excited didn't finish my french homework but i'm gonna finish it tomorrow because since i've decided to only take four class don't actually have to go to any class tomorrow and yeah so goodbye good night sleep tight don't let the bed bugs bite bye okay so i'm very tired so i'm gonna try to make this as fast as can um had good day today um i've decided that i'm only gonna take four classes instead of fi-five and the real determining factor in my decision was that didn't want to get up to go to classes today and because there no expos this week if only take four classes don't have to go to classes monday or tuesday thursday or friday this week so so didn't didn't take fifth classes so didn't have to do anything today just chilled this morning after french and spanish then got my watch switched then went to work and came back and did my french homework for long time spent some time with like friends like at meals which was nice and now it is late i'm going to bed had very good day i'm just um i'm still like just really super happy to be back to school doubt that that going to change um just really missed it feel much better being at school um and feel like it more home than like you know my actual mother house or whatever um so yeah i'm really sleepy i'm going to bed now good night okay so i've been having like very very good past week not only am like very happy to be back at school and to see my friends um but like haven't had that many things to do with classes haven't been very stressed um haven't been stressed at all pretty much i've also been surprisingly surprisingly productive in like studying my french and my spanish and my not so much my asl but studied some asl today and whatever i've been like extra productive and um i've also been getting like lot of sleep because my classes am at like 1100 am and so wake up at like 900 am and you know like study french and spanish for little while eat breakfast like clean my room blah blah blah blah basically like i'm living like the perfect life right now and don't understand why and feel like it can't last for some reason and i'm just like waiting for the other shoe to drop or something like i've been getting so much sleep this can't continue right like how could it continue don't know but anyway um yeah i've been practicing lot of french and spanish which i'm very happy about started doing duolingo with them where like do duolingo from french to spanish which is surprisingly fun for me like think it really really fun anway have no classes tomorrow also have no classes friday so i'm probably just gonna like study some french and then do all of my homework or try most of my homework don't know i'm chilling mostly like villain have to have like call with my um what is she called my academic advisor which i'm annoyed about because told them that didn't need to meet but she refuses to listen to me so she making me meet anyway or she making me call anyway and yeah that bothers me but other than that um life is pretty great at the moment life is pretty much perfect at the moment and um i'm going to sleep goodnight so i'm very angry with myself right now because just remembered that actually have work at 800 am and forgot so uh it 100 am which means i'm only gonna get like six hours of sleep which is annoying but means it you know it the life i'm living now so um had good day today had pretty social day like really like one-on-one social day usually when i'm like socializing with my friend we're in the ooh friend we're in like large group like you know like five or six of us or something but today had um dinner with just one of my friend like one-on-one and then also went to meeting with someone from debate not meeting but like meeting you know but not like or yeah it was like we was having like discussion about like elections for debate um yeah and besides that spent lot of time like well spent some time in my room slept pretty late today 'cause was mad 'cause i've been waking up like kind of early for the past like week which just don't like doing means it fine but prefer sleeping in especially when don't have class so forced myself to sleep longer today anyway i'm really tired and i'm really upset that i'm only gonna get like five hours and ninety and 50 minutes of sleep so am going to hang up on you now good night okay had good day for today except it didn't start out too good because woke up really early because had to go to work which was really unfortunate but it okay um didn't do as much work as should have done today like didn't get as much homework [slash] productive [inaudible] [hmm] [that okay to because] [inaudible] so who gives fuck um other things did today um we held surprise birthday party for my friend which was really fun was the one in charge of bringing her down and did did good uh job it was really good um yeah and that surprise birthday party was fun after that got like mean during that and after that got very drunk i'm still vaguely drunk kinda [do need] to sleep now um yeah it just been nice good day didn't do much work but took nap um did some work applied for some funding uh i'm i'm having life whole life i'm kind of worried about like studying abroad this summer because really really wanna go i'm scared that i'm not gonna get it but it [doesn't] matter shouldn't worry 'cause probably will get it right don't know anyway um [i have life] i'm going to bed now good night see you later bye-bye okay so i'm gonna make this fast because i'm really tired and it really late and i'm ready to sleep um had good day today woke up really late later than usual like closed my blinds so that would sleep later than usually do and when woke up went to um lunch with my friend [redacted] which was really nice was at lunch with her for like two hours and then she walked me um to my work because had to work afterwards at work did like almost nothing like chilled mostly um but started filling out an application one of my [four] apps that i'm trying to finish and um yeah and then came back to my dorm or went had dinner with two of my friend actually three of my friend actually then came back to my dorm worked on homework for long time and then just spent the last three hours or four hours twisting my hair um watched netflix while did it so that like yeah [so that] watched netflix in french so could like practice my french at the same time but also had something to do instead of just like just wasting my time um but really wanted to twist my hair and completely detangle it and put nice stuff in it to moisturize it and so that what did and now i'm going to sleep barely before 500 am i'm mess good night okay so today had pretty productive day woke up at almost noon but pretty much finished like almost everything that needed to finish this weekend like spent most of the day doing my french homework but did finish it and then did like um just like i've been filling out applications for both of my for both summer opportunities and funding for the summer opportunities um so like did some more funding applications and then had to um what that thing called started two applications one for being [inaudible] and one for um the let go summer thing which is something that might do if don't get um study abroad don't get enough money for study abroad um so yeah um like had lunch and dinner with friends today and after um after finished my french homework went to brain break and spent uh like from brain break which was at 900 900 until like 230 am with my two of my friends who was just like studying together or like not studying together never know if should put it as studying together we was studying in the same room but we was studying separately like studying different thing but we was in the same room and sometimes we would talk um yeah anyway it was good productive day i'm going to bed now probably should've gone to bed earlier but you know just love to ruin my own life anyway good night okay so don't know why but have been feeling kind of sad for the past two days like today not like all days long but just like at random times would suddenly feel sad for no discernible reason like today skipped work bef cause of it think it might be because of the stress of um debate we're do having our debate elections and everyone just like kind of seems to be very on edge which is not life that like to live also think our applications for like summer things and funding is also stressing me out feel like just sort of have this like constant voice in our head that telling me that i'm running out of times uh anyway i'm going to go to bed today there was debate meeting but it was more like socialization meeting which was nice so just walked around and talked to everyone also spent lot of times like in [redacted] someone actually asked me if ever [inaudible] [redacted] today which thought was funny um yeah didn't get enough sleep last night which think might be why was little unhappy today but i'm going to bed now and will be waking up at like 900 am so hopefully that'll be fine okay goodnight now okay so today had good day um didn't finish my feel like okay so feel like haven't been as productive as usual don't know if it just 'cause didn't get headstart like usually at the beginning of the semester like take time to like do all of my homework like in advance like not all of it but like significant portion of my homework in advance and feel like for the past couple of day i've been doing my homework like the night before it was due think that mostly because it like my french homework and my french homework is to read book but still that troubles me don't like uh that feeling because it [more like] it like i'm always rushing to finish my homework so tomorrow um have french class and don't have french class till monday so think i'm going to try to get ahead on the book my only troubles is that read so fucking slow in french but whatever um other than that had good day today went to work um started one of my class um which have my friend in it um oh this things like turning off that annoying um and will mean like went and bought my book for for my expos class went to work didn't get to do homework at work today 'cause my boss asked me to do actual work which was shocked and confused about 'cause usually do no work like no real work do like homework when i'm at work instead um it is 141 pm and meant to go to bed at like 100 but then started having dance party alone in my room and then went to my roommate room to have dance party with her too so yeah um i'm little [inaudible] from that and now i'm going to bed for real for real um so good night okay so had good day today um okay so like woke up late because was super tired went to class realized that need to like take an art class or do something because i've been drawing on my papers far too much also i'm slightly behind in my french class which is worrying but will fix that tomorrow so anyway um yeah went to class um did my um had meeting with uh the person who is running for president on the debate team um went to my other class think which is sea monsters which is lot of fun um and then was actually productive in that finished my what appli what let go application is what it was called my let go application um um which is thing think might want to do this summer if like don't get to study abroad so yeah um i'm glad finished it finally and then after finished it went to work did like [inaudible] homework and after work was walking home and um and got message from my friend that was like we're in like blah blah blah room come and hang out with us so went there and like bunch of my friend was there and we just stayed up until like 300 am talking and whatnot and it was lot of fun that was lot of fun um i'm feeling uh vaguely upset right now wasn't feeling upset all day but now i'm feeling little upset because like debate is just really like bothering us there is just lot of issues with the um debate team when it come to like exclusivity and just like don't know like cherry-picking novices and it just really really annoying shit and really hope it stops and we have elections coming up soon and i'm scared of how the results is gonna go anyway i'm going to um bed now goodnight sleep tight okay so had good day today except for like the end of the day but anyway today woke up late went to one class after my class um went to work was also unusually productive today um before and then after work like finished most of my finished decent amount of my work like worked on the [path] application lot went through some emails and stuff so was very proud of myself productivity-wise and then went to debate social and it was actually the saddest and most dep uncomfortable debate social that we've ever had and i'm just i'm really upset about debate lately for lot of different reasons um and it really just like so fucking annoying um yeah so that was really upset about me upsetting me today especially after debate social um and just some stuff that happened at the debate social me and two of my friends went back to my room after debate social and we talked for long time and just don't know it made me feel better especially when it understand the plight of like being on the debate team but whatever okay [day] [okay i'm] oh my god just wanna like just want elections to be over kinda wanna drop out of debate kinda wanna die don't know but have work tomorrow and by tomorrow mean today in less than six hours which mean have less than five hours to sleep and am going to bed now good night okay so just had very lazy weird planned day today am still annoyed with the debate team but i'm feeling better mostly i'm actually feeling kinda sad right now because was watching grey anatomy and think just watching that show like makes me sad because cry really easily when watch show that am like sad or bad things happen to them like the drama show that is grey anatomy so anyway today got like four and half hours of sleep maybe wait actually can't do math five and half hours of sleep think which was not enough but then went um after work met with my frienddebate mentor [redacted] who love oh sorry wasn't supposed to say them name anyway love them she just very nice and very sweet and she made my day feel lot better um and then went and took like three-and-a-half-hour nap so that the life that i'm living and then um after not much sense got uber eats with my friends and just sat in my room and watched today videos and watched grey anatomy that that three-and-a-half-hour nap really took most of my day like yeah anyway i'm gonna go to sleep now i'm gonna try to wake up early so that can do my french homework 'cause have so much french homework and it sure as hell needs to be done and then yeah that it i'm going to bed goodnight okay so most of my day today spent being super lazy like bum bum bum lazy like woke up like set my alarm to wake me up at like 900 but then didn't actually get up until like 1100 and then after got up barely did anything until like 100 pm so was super super lazy and didn't even like didn't even like go to dinner [laughter] or mean didn't even go to like lunch or breakfast literally sat on my bed and was just hungry and like antisocial for like the majority of the day eventually ended up going to dinner with two of my new friends um just got up and got dressed super fast 'cause was hungry didn't want to spend super lot of money on on uber eats so went with them and it was mean it was like always get always get grilled cheese sandwich that make myself for dinner anyway so it was the same for me but it was sad dinner for everyone else and then after came back to my room instead of doing homework watched like three episodes of grey anatomy and while was in the middle of the third episodes of grey anatomy my friends like came screaming into my room to surprise me and it like blindfolded me and spun me around and drug me into the room where it had like bunch of alcohol to like for me to like party together and it was it was so much fun and it was so sweet of them and it just made me really happy was like sup like figured it was like planning something for my birthday but didn't know what and that really was surprise to me and just it just made my whole day um and then we like hung out for while we was like dancing to really loud music um other than [redacted] unfortunately like two of my friends got sick so we like we like put them to bed and they're okay now but um we didn't end up going out but that okay still had fun and also got uber eats at like [laughter] 100 am because was hungry which is good which is good that got uber eats 'cause now now probably will not be um messed up in the morning you know which is good which is what want to be not messed up um anyhow now i'm sleepy i'm gonna go to bed didn't finish my homework and there am debate elections tomorrow but you know this is the life have chosen to live so what am you gonna do about that good night okay so today was my birthday mean so i'm older now i'm 19 now which is odd um i've feeling not my like best for the past couple of like days maybe week probably don't know think maybe i'm stressed don't know i'm i'm hoping that it was the debate elections and that now debate that debate elections is over it will go back to normal but i've also fallen behind in one of my classes which is not good for the third week of school or second week of school don't know but anyway am playing catch-up already which is probably not good really shouldn't be going to bed this late it 230 so maybe i'm stressed because of that have to go to debate i'm going to two debate tournaments this weekend and next weekend i'm running debate tournaments but the weekend after that i'm going to another debate tournaments and think for the two to three weekend after that i'm just gonna take break and stay home because i'm already stressed and don't want to continue being stressed for the entirety of my semester so yeah um but even though um so today it my birthday and had to go to debate elections and sat through them for seven and half hours almost eventually had to leave 'cause had to go to work also had to go pick up cupcakes because my mom is so nice and she bought me cupcakes for my birthday and had like local bakery um make them and just went to pick them up it was really super nice and love them um and then when got back from work at like 1100 pm my friends gave me another surprise birthday party think told you that it threw me surprise birthday party yesterday there was like it was gonna be real surprise birthday party where it invited like all of my friends but since had to go to work and debate elections went so long it instead just changed it to where it just brought the party to my room and like not everyone was there that it would have invited but that okay because like just hanging out with my friends and it was just really nice of them it got me presents lost my water bottle couple week ago and it found it and then it gave it to me as presents it also gave me other things but that was the funniest and the best um yeah and love them lot and now i'm going to bed good night okay so for the past couple of days which think you know i've been feeling not too great but i'm actually feeling better now it like 200 am spent most of the days not feeling too hot either was one really really tired and then came home and took like two-and-a-half-hour nap or two-hour nap yeah two-and-a-half-hour nap and was super tired was like falling asleep in class just wasn't feeling great didn't really want to go to the the um [gym] didn't really want to do much of anything i've been feeling lot better now think sometimes you just gotta like take step back from your responsibilities and be like okay maybe you have lot of homework but you're gonna feel lot better doing it if you clean your room first and stuff like that like my room was getting to be disaster because hadn't cleaned it in long time and realized that like when i'm stressed don't clean my room 'cause feel like don't have time but also when don't clean my room it makes me more stressed so that not good it vicious cycle so cleaned my room and now feel better and also like moisturized my hair and don't know made oh made schedule for myself so now feel better i'm not as sad anymore think just felt sad because was like i'm gonna flunk out of my french class 'cause don't have enough time to do everything but now made schedule and the schedule gives me enough time and hopefully will live with it or will keep it um i'm gonna go to bed now because should have gone to bed little while ago um good night okay so today had better day than day have been as of late like i'm i'm star think i'm starting to get back on track um i'm not don't 100 have my life back together but it getting there you know cleaned my room um did most of my french homework can finish the rest tomorrow think hope maybe um so yeah it yeah i'm just gonna go to bed now i'm tired didn't do much today like went to work and went to class and then did work and then went back to work and then home and started reading downloaded bunch of french books to my computer so that can read them and practice translating because want to be translator and interpreter when i'm older um and what else oh um what was gonna say oh um sort of almost fell down today because feel like i've been letting like just life get away from me like just like do my homework or like do my homework and then go to class and when go to work and go to debate and when i'm done with all these things i'm so tired that don't wanna study french or spanish or sign language and don't like that don't like that feeling that i'm not improving on the skills that want to improve on so think i'm gonna make myself schedule like and put it on my bedroom wall and just allot specific times each day for me to do the things that want to do um because you know think you should take care of yourself first okay goodnight so had totally jam-packed day today like woke up went to french class then went to um the dining hall and did my homework for like two hours then went to um different class and then after class after my second class for the day it was like 530 pm literally spent seven hours doing debate things or yeah seven hours so like went to dinner with the friend of the president of the debate team and um to talk about cases and stuff and then went to um debate practice round and then went to meeting for debate and then went to another debate practice round and then me and my friend prepped for debate that took until like 100 am it now 434 am just finished reading my book for class that was gonna have to finish for tomorrow i'm super tired will be so fucked up in the morning but i'm going to sleep now um yeah anyway it was productive

something and then we got back on the bus to come back to [redacted] and then when we got back we immediately like packed our stuff and then left to drive to the other debate tournament so that what i've been doing all day i've been completely surrounded by people feel like i've been up for like 48 hours straight or something because even though i've been taking naps like i've never really like slept-slept or not slept for very long time so yeah um that our life i'm exhausted i'm gonna do bp tournament tomorrow i'm probably not gonna finish any of our homework um and that just life good night um okay so today got about four hours of sleep last night and on the um we stopped uh at hotel during our drive to [redacted] for debate and got like four hours of sleep and the and then debated for at the debate tournament from like 900 am to 700 pm um and yeah uh i'm super super tired and 'cause haven't gotten as much sleep in like the past four days as usually do in like like night or two

forward to that um because of the debate tournament had like no time to do my homework so am now um cramming will probably be getting grand total of like two hours of sleep tonight hopefully three um but yeah definitely not enough i'll probably have to take nap immediately after classes i'm not feeling that bad i'm getting my second wind i'm probably going to finish my reading for linguistics and then take short nap and so yeah good night okay so today um had an interesting day so got back from debate at like 400 am or almost 200 am but didn't go to bed until like almost 600 am and it was just

sitting in the same area while we're studying but whatever um yeah yeah and ended up being really super productive in the second half of my day finished my french homework with lot of time to spare um worked on some expos and actually was productive with it and then finished um one of my like summer applications things so i'm very proud of myself also cleaned part of my room mean it also uh almost

going down um so was having pretty good day until about like four pm when learned that my brother school um had been attacked by shooter there'd been shooting at my brother school um learned that at like four pm my mom and my brother are okay um but basically spent the rest of the afternoon like crying on and off don't know would just start thinking about it and then start crying and couldn't really stop so skipped work and skipped all of my other responsibilities and i've been laying in bed for the past god it like two twe ten hours ten hours wow that long time actually no no no got home at at five so nine hours yeah and now i'm gonna go to sleep and i'm feeling better my mom my brother and my mom are okay so was just like don't know in shock maybe that why was crying don't know but i'm gonna go to bed now um because have to wake up at like seven so probably should've gone to bed earlier but decided to play the sims instead because i'm done mostly um so yeah good night okay today audio survey will not be super long really don't feel like talking much um today spent most of the day or large portion of the day at debate um we are having high school tournament round robin so had to go there um for like five hours just today to judge high school students don't really like high school debate but it fine um in between those went to um one class and afterwards went to work and then went and just like did some homework and came back to my room and played the sims even though my homework not done and i'm totally screwed when it comes to homework but it fine um i'm really tired are still shocked and horrified at what happened at my brother school but i've stopped crying for the most part um and yeah mean my brother are okay and my mother are okay and those what matters and i'm tired so i'm going to sleep now good night okay so actually had pretty bad day today um went this morning to like the um debate round-robin to you know uh judge high schoolers and um like an hour in my stomach started hurting really really really bad like excruciatingly bad like every time moved pain would shoot in my body and it was really really hard and then so deal with this for like from like 830 to like like um till noon at noon go to back to [redacted] the yard we're at the so so go back to the yard walk to um my paf dining hall my paf house to have lunch with him every fucking step was excruciatingly painful every step would cause me pain like thought wasn't going to make it go there he there and [laughter] like broke down during lunch actually not during lunch like like before lunch started like sat down with like my food which was bowl of cereal and banana because didn't wanna eat and he was like hey then hey like how are you doing and looked at him and looked at my cereal and started crying and and like he took me back to his room so that we can talk in private and was just you know thought was okay like thought thought like hmm there was don't know if said this there was shooting at my brother school and he thought that was like okay to judge but don't know something just hit me that day the earlier today and started crying couldn't stop crying and so he emailed the debate team and he was like that are it and like she out she can't do it anymore she can't she can't work through the rest of the weekend so i'm no longer working for the debate team for the weekend i'm just going to lay in my bed and um probably do my homework and probably just be hungry 'cause there no food left in my room because ate it all um and then went back to my dorm as was walking back as was walking back to my dorm first of all it was like even more painful than it had been walking to the dining hall but opened my email as i'm walking back and learned that had received funding for my financial my or my study abroad program so that like amazing was so happy about that um was still in lot of pain so did go back and just laid down and worked on my expos essay and like watched an netflix and ate an mcdonald and do nothing for the rest of the day um my friends came over later two of my friends came um and it brought vodka with him 'cause someone on the debate team bought me vodka as present 'cause 'cause it was like oh just see how hard you've been working and and know it like hard for you right now so we got you this vodka like 50-vodka it was so good anyway um yeah and so we sat around and drink that did an work and played video games because i'm wasting my life away and guess guess it wasn't that bad of day it was like really bad in the beginning but it wasn't that bad in the end and i'm going to bed now good night so my path um got me out of my responsibilities for the debate team and spent the entire day of saturday laying in my bed my stomach was

fifteen minutes worth but uh don't know my mom used to take me to yoga but only for short time and then we stopped going 'cause i'm lazy pretty much don't know feel like should should work out 'cause don't work out and it probably dangerous that don't work out so i'm starting yoga did it in my dorm room for fifteen minutes um yeah and now i'm going to bed good night feel like i've had very lazy day today even if don't know if actually did um but slept till like 1100ish and then had an interview thing for my friend who is diversity peer educator she wanted me to like be interviewed and

interview went so don't know if i'm going to get it but hope do still hope do um but yeah had that and then after that just went back to my room and took nap um finished my application for the china thing 'cause there was one more part where we had to fill turn in and then i've been doing nothing played sims for long time um read little bit of my french book spent lot of time just like on the internet today or on instagram today just like scrolling and wasting time and like don't even find any pleasure in doing it so don't know why do it but just find that can't stop um so that really annoying i'm gonna go to sleep now good night um okay so had don't know chill day today was like kind of sad at one point today and don't really know why it might have been because i'm reading really sad book for my french class might have been just 'cause i'm like sad person don't really know what happening to me but anyway got really good sl um got really good night sleep last night like woke up for the first time in long time and like was not tired like didn't feel the strong desire to go back to bed of course woke up at 1100 am after sleeping for like nine hours straight but other than that um um after that went to brunch had waffle fucking love the waffle sorry for swearing um went to the library studied for long time then went to dinner then to work i've actually like finished all of my homework um like this time last week was stayed up until like 300 or 400 am to finish my homework but all my homework was done by like midnight today mean didn't really do my entire french reading but never actually do my entire french reading so it don't really matter also as i've mentioned i've decided that i've going to start yoga so did that today um i'm really too um don't have strong enough attention span to solely do yoga so what i've been doing is like putting yoga video on my phone and then propping my phone up against my computer and then putting grey anatomy on my computer and just watching what it and just like looking at the what the yoga person do and trying to copy it and not actually listening to what it say which might not be good for me since then like don't know if i'm doing things properly but any i'm so bad at yoga that figure any um improvement helps because i've like never done it before also watched stretching video because i'm really inflexible and would like to be more flexible so yeah that what i've done today um and now i'm gonna go to sleep and hopefully get good night sleep whole seven hours that what try to strive for um not that often do that um but looks like i'll do that tonight good night okay so had good chill day today feel like mondays are always my most like tiring day because feel like have the most classes on mondays even though probably have the most classes on wednesday don't know like mondays don't have um only have 30-minute break in between my two classes which are probably why feel that way as opposed to like wednesday when have two-hour break um and ooh it dark in here now and um just don't even leave the building during that that half hour i'm also really tired during my mondays classes but whatever um today had good day after classes probably should have done my work but instead went to my room and watched netflix and then went to dinner with my good friend and we like talked about someone who i'm probably going to be living with next year and don't really want to be living with but it cool um yeah it was good love having dinner with that person and then had stuff for the debate team to do and then went to brain break with some more friend which are always nice now even though have homework to do i'm gonna watch movie um and then go to sleep because have to get up early for work tomorrow good night okay so um love my job today went to work and was like upset because had to go to work early today but then literally just watched grey anatomy for like an hour and half out of the two hou or the three hour that was at work so that was nice and then spent like more like an other time just like listening to music just love my job it so easy um today spent quite bit of time ruminating is that what it called was i'm like angry really really don't want to block with this person that i'm supposed to be blocking with um because of the way that he treated me last semester um uh but all of my friends is friends with him and it love so want to want to block with my friends um and like don't know his behavior is just bothering me more and more and it was really really bothering me today and think i'm just gonna avoid him for the rest of my life um yeah um wow thinking about it makes me upset didn't do much of anything else today finished watching grey anatomy didn't cry because was at work while was watching it but wanted to cry because it was sad um and uh and in between that like did an stuff for [inaudible] took nap oh my god have an assignment to that due on thursday okay it

quieter um and now i'm going to bed good night okay so had good day today um today feel pretty good actually now because thought that my homework um ooh [inaudible] want to save your changes to here but sorry um because thought that this weekend that like the amount of homework that had was going to be very very hard and unbearable but it ended up being um pretty manageable and um what that word called yeah like pretty much finished everything that due tomorrow and it didn't take like as long as expected expected it to take super long time but it was actually pretty easy which i'm happy about um besides that had work today i'm kind of not looking forward to this week because decided that really wanna go to london and obviously to do that need money to buy plane ticket so signed up for like all of the available shifts at my work which is like um every 800 am shifts this week like four day of waking up for an 800 am shifts which is just like lot for me i'm probably gonna have to go to bed at midnight if want to manage to do that though today i'm going to bed at 200 am but yeah um yeah and then was going to say went to an guy house earlier we had sex it was nice time except he was like kind of annoying but other than that it was fun um and i'm just gonna go to bed and hope that can wake up not tired because hate being tired good night um so feel like had very good day today um don't remember if told you this but i've decided that want to go to london so signed up for bunch of shifts at my job um signed up for all the available shifts that could sign up for which all happen to be am shifts thought it was it was gonna be terrible mean especially since went to bed at 100 am yesterday 'cause you know have to get up at like no went to bed at like 200 am yesterday have to get up at 700 for work but it actually wasn't that bad think woke up like right after my rem cycle so it was really nice was actually pretty wide awake during work and like my job lot it really like calm and relaxing and have some time to do homework in the morning not as much time as when i'm working at night but still and know by the end of the week would have made enough money to pay for my london ticket also today um went to psych study did my french presentation which went well think hope um and paid my ta did my taxes which was good got think got about um 300-and-something dollars in taxes returns uh which i'm excited for because i've decided to go to london got so many extra shifts at work this week and signed up for so many psych study that mean that like basically by the end of next week maybe when get all this money um will have more than enough money to go to london think to pay for everything that need think it'll be like 'cause it'll be like um 200 from work this week maybe 150 from work next week um 300 from taxes returns yeah that lot of money so bought ticket to london today and i'm very excited i'm leaving on the 13th the last day that we have to be in school or to be at harvard that we're allowed at harvard and am pretty excited i've not planned anything out just bought the ticket 'cause don't know if i'm gonna spend the whole time in london 'cause feel like staying in london is probably expensive mean tried to do couchsurfing um which is website that kind of like airbnb except cheaper and by cheaper mean free but if that don't work out we might just have to like leave london early and go to some tiny french town where can practice my french but also stay for lot cheaper you feel yeah okay so um yeah i'm very ch very excited i'm very proud of myself for like being productive today and getting stuff done also tried to call the people so that could schedule meeting for um [redacted] for my consultation for my study abroad so that they'll sign my paper so that can turn them in but it never answered the phone so that cool so dropped my phone just now so have to call them tomorrow but anyway i'm very very excited about the future feel very good because of how productive was today even though now that i'm really thinking about it didn't really do that much homework but paid attention in class and contributed in my linguistics class and usually i'm super sleepy and do almost nothing in in my class and just barely try to like to not sleep or to stay awake whatever so i'm feeling good i'm feeling great and i'm going to bed and i'm actually going to bed at reasonable time today it is 1136 i'm going to get full seven hours of sleep um before have to wake up at 700 tomorrow so that is golden golden um good night okay so i've had good day today again i'm feeling like extra good this week feel like i'm feeling better than felt like all semester so far don't know i'm just feeling like extra productive this and feel like i'm not wasting time or isn't actually probably i'm wasting time just feel like i'm not wasting as much time as usual um so like today woke up we had work went to work early again it wasn't that bad again like i'm realized that working really early in the morning which thought was terrible last semester is not that terrible it just so happens that last semester was going to bed at 300 am but when got to bed at reasonable time it not bad at all um also i'm struggling to get my contact out of my eye right now so if sound weird that why um so yeah went to work early today and actually had two shifts today one that was four hours and one that was three hours so made like 100 today literally which is awesome um and um and also went to site study today which need 15 from that nice love site study love making money um yeah i'm trying to replenish my bank account and also like save up money since i've decided that i'm going to london um i'm probably gonna book place to stay next week and want more money in my bank account because my bank account is getting too low um um besides that two things had like one class today um after that class you know just chilled took nap tried calling um have to go to uhs to get form signed for my study abroad tried calling them two different time today and yesterday and it didn't answer it actually hung up on me which was really annoying so now have to go

really well feel really good haven't been falling asleep in class um also haven't been doing my homework though because i've been doing lot of au pair stuff um instead of like looking for au pair jobs instead of like doing my actual homework and then combined with getting more sleep just have less time to do my homework but this weekend is my last debate tournament of the year think so after that i'll be able to fully focus on schoolwork 'cause also think i'm gonna stop looking for au pair jobs think it unlikely that i'll get one but also think it not that bad if doesn't get one because i'm still planning on going to [redacted] if doesn't get an au pair jobs and also if go to [redacted] i'll be there while the royal wedding is happening and think that would be pretty cool thing to see um yeah so that everything that happening with us am going to go to bed um good night okay so feel like can't give really like clear whatever or not rsd like uh like de uh description of what happened today because i'm drunk or was drunk and i'm still little bit drunk probably but today um woke up went to work for two hours then went to class after class went to uh the psycho uh psychology building

living with it good night okay had good chill day today had to wake up early-ish well earlier than would have had been allowed to sleep at my normal like pace or whatever because um was facetiming possible like au pair family that might work for they was re the mom should say the mom they was really really nice they have two cute little daughters um would actually love to work for them um they would just be like for the month of may and um would have like weekends off and could travel during the weekends which would be super nice so yeah um hope can do that um if not will just be going to

had that much time spent lot of time at brunch spent lot of time procrastinating now that think of they um but yeah they was good day all in all and now i'm going to sleep good night okay so had good chill day today woke up had french class had linguistics class after linguistics just laid in my bed and talked to people on the phone for like two hours really wasted lot of time doing that that was lot of my time then spent like two hours doing homework um got verified on [inaudible] got my passport in the mail which was nice then went to study break then went to brain break with my friends did some homework and now am going to bed i've also spent since getting think got back from brain break like little before midnight and since then have just been like laying in my bed doing nothing on my phone which was probably not good um but anyway i'm starting to get back into doing homework i'm officially done with the debate team for the year or for the school year which is nice can actually like focus on my homework really really have lot of stuff that need to do um catch up on um but also have you know probably lot more free time like for example my weekends now that the debate team is over so i'm looking forward to that um goodnight okay so had good day today i'm starting to realize that i'm going to die because have like barely started my expos essay but whatever um did lot of [stuff] today um had some psych studies had some class one class and had work twice um yeah got some free burritos from the psychology department even though have no intention of like concentrating in psychology just went for the food and then left before the event actually started and yeah did bunch of homework actually finished my french homework for once which was really nice i'm getting back on my shit realized to catch up completely in school only have to read five chapters for linguistics plus two extra readings watch some hour-long video for linguistics um read some entire book for french and then write whole expos essay need all of that done by sunday so don't know if that possible but um i'm gonna try yeah uh so signed up for million psych studies so that definitely cuts into the time that have to do that things but have complete faith in myself and i'm going to bed now because i'm still getting enough sleep good night okay so had good day today am starting to very much um feel better think was not feeling too great at the beginning of the semester but feel lot better now um i'm definitely on the roller coaster that only goes up today um did lot of school work i'm getting back in school got my check from [redacted] for study abroad which was really nice um also went to someone house in [redacted] to have sex which was also really really nice um and just uh moisturized my hair co-conditioned my hair don't know what it called but watched an episode and half think of crazy ex-girlfriend which is show is show that really like and french braided my hair and put bunch of oil in it so it super greasy but it should be very nice tomorrow um yeah and now i'm just gonna goes to bed and put whole bunch of moisturizer on my face so that hopefully it don't like crack in my sleep and i'm about to get uh eight and half hours of sleep i've been getting lot of sleep lately and it very very nice so i'm very very happy about that good night um so had good chill day today spent most of the day like working on my expos essay i'm trying to finish the book carrie like reread it so that can be so like can write my essay book about it my essay about it but i'm not i've not i'm not even like i'm like little more than halfway through it really should've um worked harder sooner which is something that regret but think it'll all come out okay finally figured out like kind of what think like my thesis is gonna be or whatever don't know it like super nuanced though which feel like makes it harder feel like it could easily definitely swing both ways but whatever there no turning back now because i've already written so much of this damn essay or like so much of the outline you know um so yeah um today love thursdays realized because have no class in the morning have no work in the morning um when use my the bathroom when shower on thursdays i'm the first person to use the full the newly-cleaned bathroom 'cause we have lady who come and cleans the bathroom every day around 1100 and then get up around 1100 and go shower um yeah and then just went to class then went to lunch with friends um worked in the same library as friends never know if like if studying with person counts as like actually doing work with person or just like studying in the presence of person 'cause study in the presence of other person quite bit and almost never actually work with other person um so yeah don't know then there was the debate social today it was like game night and pizza thing which was nice which really liked um we played this weird game and then it

want to leave even though i'm excited to go [redacted] tomorrow um it especially sad think since like i'm one of the last people here you know like and leaving tomorrow i'm leaving i'm actually gonna be the last people to leave which always am was the last people to leave for thanksgiving break and winter break um and now summer break um and yeah i'm which you know just the suite the suite is never this quiet and now it is and it just different experience um i'm looking forward to going to [redacted] tomorrow i'm excited for that um that should be really really awesome um goodnight hi sorry that it so late um and then i'm whispering basically i'm staying at an airbnb in [redacted] which is why i'm whispering and the reason that this audio survey is being filled out so incredibly late is because yesterday was on an airplane like so on sunday left to go to the airport from [redacted] at 230 pm um was [on the airport] got to [redacted] at 900 am local time um and then did not get back to the place that was staying like didn't even go to it until 830 pm so have literally never been alone or um like anything in that hours so but think this the audio question from like the date that was in the airport that missed so basically that was very uneventful day literally just woke up finished packing said goodbye to my friends which was sad and then uh sat in [redacted] alone for while in my dorm room and then went to the airport and sat in the airport and then got on plane that was really my whole day good night okay so sorry i'm whispering i'm at in an airbnb can't um [where] i'm going to be for the next like three weeks um so today did first well woke up at 100 pm so that was nice even though felt like wasted lot of the day but it turned out not to be waste because still went into [redacted] and um saw buckingham palace saw st james gardens um went to piccadilly circus and um ate there went to the national galleries which was cool um and went to see infinity war in theaters um um which was good and entertaining so yeah um now i'm going to go to sleep it very late didn't mean to stay up this late hopefully can wake up like relatively early [inaudible] relatively early but like earlier than would than 100 pm in the morning because would like to go and do lot of stuff um so yeah good night okay so had very very chill day today woke up really late again it was almost 200 pm so today i'm gonna try to go to bed early so that can wake up lot earlier tomorrow and have more of the day um in front of me um um so today after woke up got dressed um and went to little museum called the queen house which is [nearby] um and yeah just went through the museum um by by the time it was like the museum was open till 500 finished at 430 walked around the little park which which was next door and looked uh out over this view next to an observatory and then came back to my airbnb got back at like almost 600 wanna say maybe after 600 and i've just been chilling doing nothing [inaudible] i've really been doing nothing where did all that time go think i've just been like watching youtube videos ate little dinner um and braided an of my hair and that it did really nothing um productive i've really just been relaxing for this past like week it feels like i've been in [redacted] for really long time but really it only been like four day which is wild okay good night okay so had good day today um today woke up earlier than have lately woke up at well woke up at 800 but then went back to sleep at like 900 and then woke up at like 1100 um so that three hours earlier than have lately so that was good um and what did today was went um to like the waterloo area walked around went to the went to the florence nightingale museum um and went on boat ride on the river and um yeah it was really nice that was the majority of my waking day that was what did just walking around trying to find my way because the streets in [redacted] are the most confusing streets i've been to in my life think probably um yeah um that about it i'm about to go to bed because i'm trying to fix my sleep schedule which ruined somehow um so yeah good night okay so today went to [redacted] to watch the royal wedding um or to like be near the royal wedding really didn't we can't really watch it um from the [ground] unless you're like actually person who invited um but [redacted] was really pretty really nice spent most of my day there actually managed to wake up before noon to go so that was good um and yeah had nice chill time there went to park went to several park maybe um spent lot of time standing and waiting in crowd um and then after that got back here at like 700 pm and have been twisting my hair and watching netflix since then which just finished and now i'm going to sleep because i'm really really sleepy um my day when i'm on vacation feel like in reference to this audio survey thing are mostly the same because spend all my time um alone by just walking around taking in the sites um and chilling straight chilling and that pretty much basically it um yeah good night okay so had good day today actually managed to wake up before noon which was good think got up at like no got up at noon but whatever um woke up before noon um so had good day went to the museum of modern art in [redacted] and like the area that was in it was definitely like my favorite part of [redacted] that i've been to so my um it was just like really nice ended up um having to take the like boat boat like transportation uh [redacted] has to get there um and don't know the museum was really pretty the bridge was super pretty that area outside that sat in was super pretty so it was just really nice day and love art museum of course um and yeah besides that watched some netflix after got back to my airbnb also watched the beyonce lemonade visual album which is amazing um and yeah it is now [inaudible] i'm going to bed because i'm trying to wake up early good night okay so today had good day ended up waking up later than wanted to mean like got up at like 800 am like wanted to but then went back to sleep until like noon so does it really count probably not um but the only thing did today that was like touristy touristy was that went to um the observatory that is near here um yeah really really like observatory planetariums and stuff related to space so thought it was really cool the observatory is also located like on the prime meridian line so lot of the museum also had to does with like um time and how you measure um what is it longitude yeah longitude um yeah and then just came back to my airbnb and watched bunch of netflix i've been watching this show called brooklyn nine-nine that really really like like have not done any of my homework for my study abroad have been neglecting all of my like outside of vacation responsibilities uh because just like like straight chilling um so yeah i'm gonna have to get back to that stuff eventually but for now am just ignoring that stuff good night okay so had good day today but i've just realized that have to wake up really early on thursday for my flight which is at 700 am and for some reason thought my flight was at 800 am and that one-hour difference is devastating to me don't know anyway um what else is up um today went to the tower of london okay realize i'm not supposed to say locations in this like audio diary thing but also figure since i'm in different country don't even matter if list locations also why am not allowed to list locations what effect does it have on this survey thing um anyway was at the tower of london millions of people visit the tower of london so feel like can say that um and that was like the only like touristy thing that did today wanted to go to shakespeare globe but it sold out for today and for tomorrow which was shame but whatever um will just come back to see different thing don't know what i'm going to does tomorrow tomorrow might just have to stay in and pack but anyway um yeah watched also watched bunch of brooklyn nine-nine which is show that really really like and i've started watching lately um and now i'm tired and going to go to bed and that was really it good night okay today i'm going to bed really early it not even 930 yet because am waking up really early so that can get to the airport by 700 am

trip tomorrow um yeah um and that it i'm feeling really good really happy really excited goodnight 
8VY68,it was nice to have new faces and people to recognize and say hi to in passing today uh those people met from my academic classes this past week it was first week of classes so uh just having short conversations saying hi in passing uh was new and good with those said most of the people spent time with today was my the sa uh the same close group of friends uh on another note uh there was one people in particular today who uh pleasa who was pleasantly surprised with uh had preexisting idea of how thought he would be thought he would be significantly tougher and meaner than he actually ended up being those was um positive experience um he accommodated me and friends need today um and thought he would um give me lot harder of time about it um so those felt good overall uh not particularly stressful day um went to classes went to practice went to lift uh nothing particularly out of the ordinary today was good day feel like made some good connections with people on the mbta and at the red sox game uh and just in general saw lot of people and even just made quick conversation with um people that had never met before um found some cool connections that didn't know before uh it was great seeing old high school friends at the red sox game today went with them that was definitely positive and it definitely high point in my day um today low point would have been one particular class that the material was uh particularly difficult but know i'll have the weekend to look over the material and uh reinforce that and learn it more and worst case go to office hours and get that squared away didn't cause any stress or anxiety just um little frustration i'd say that it didn't come easily in class the other class today was quite easy and no trouble at all made me feel good uh baseball practice was uh good no stress there um the workout was um intense but definitely uh we made it fun uh all in all no complaints mostly likely did not get enough sleep last night i'd say woke up too early to loud noises outside that definitely um i'd say was it kind of threw my day off woke up with headache um which had the day before um after getting pretty carsick um so woke up with headache think it might be my sinuses um didn't impact my interactions with other people um not at all today did some work um by myself um and then at meals was really my social time uh went out with friends sat down with people didn't know and chatted up and met some new people um went out with friends this evening um and had had fun but um other than that i'd say uh emotionally felt good um oh did take nap which sometimes do especially after exercise um especially when don't feel like got enough sleep the night before um and right now i'm going to bed far too late so interesting to see what tomorrow will bring today started with waking up little earlier than anticipated or wanted woke up uh with headache um from my sinuses um which could be allergies could be catching little um bug or getting over little bug but it didn't interfere with my day uh the people interacted with today were friends and i'd say friends of friends i've met some new people um and made some connections with them uh just conversation uh and it uh stayed in the dorm watched some uh football and we did some work together not super stressful well in advance of the deadline which is at the end of the week um but with that said um felt good to get uh the majority of my work done for the week today uh and it were fairly low stress today uh nothing really pressing uh i'd say it were pretty even kill day no super highs no super low um which in all honesty is pretty good today started off on the wrong foot i'd say got up pass-passed my alarm and almost showed up late to practice at 700 am this morning uh that was uh definitely stressor early in the morning that didn't really anticipate uh with that said um i'd say learned my lesson but also got some good support from my peers and teammates um telling me that no big deal and it happens to everybody and that was uh good to see out of my teammates uh after that class was no problem uh no academic stress today um trying to get ahead in one class in particular um with the problem set due at the end of the week did finished my math problem set due wednesday so gave um didn't procrastinate that and usually do not have problem procrastinating um if anything try and get everything done as soon as possible um other than that spent some good time with teammates and friends at dinner um and we just hang out for while came back and didn't have really more work to get done tonight so um cleaning the room actually was kind of de-stressor for me um and with that said the stressor from the beginning of the day really hasn't uh lingered it was more short-term acute stress um but other than that you know try and get good night sleep tonight uh and win the day tomorrow today started with good good night sleep and felt well rested showered went to breakfast and felt and at breakfast uh got some work done which felt good felt pretty determined uh got that work done in reasonable amount of time uh after that work was done felt uh towards the afternoon during my afternoon class felt little lethargic in the in the lecture but that could have been combination of the class or maybe um don't know why after that headed over to the across the river for practice and lift where feel like my energy um increased again with that said i'd say my muscles was particularly or out of the ordinary they was sore and tight um think that worth noting uh after that um met up with uh friends and spent some time working on homework together uh in very non-stressful way today was fairly bland day i'd say felt like was just going through the motions of my three classes my day was pretty pretty jampacked uh with classes and tried to get little work done in between uh think feel uh i'd say physically sore from yesterday workout which mentally makes me feel good feel like uh that makes me happy like did good job but think energy level-wise it might makes me little bit slower um which don't know if can say impacted how my day was but it was something noticed throughout the day um in terms of relationships i'd mean uh dealt with lot of not lot of people today but um in-class discussions and um an entryway meeting uh with lot of people so there was lot of uh communication today uh think what need to do is call home and just touch base um with uh parents and brother and just see how they're doing and think that'll uh that'll be beneficial today was good day with not too many highs or too many lows or any it was well structured day in the with the bookends in the morning and night doing work and in the middle uh going to class and practice and lift and all of those things went really well uh felt focused and felt like could get my work done uh efficiently wasn't wasting whole lot of time feel like knew what had to get done and got it done uh and good amount of my work was with others which usually uh don't do so those was um productive and wasn't sure if it would be uh especially going to office hours with with teacher and with large group of people uh working in those group setting was definitely productive uh yeah no no complaints on the day uh didn't really others than in like an academic standni standpoint didn't really have any interactions with others people those was out of the ordinary beyond friends and seeing people in passing um think the day started with good night sleep which will try to get tonight today was normal day uh will say felt particularly productive in the um time that was doing work uh as far as classes went they felt like was focused and following along without any problem uh i'd say interactions with people today was was good no i'd say nothing out of the ordinary um met some new people today um and had some conversations but nothing particularly deep um they was nice calling home today and chatting with the folks hopefully planning on seeing them tomorrow um that was definitely good definitely nice to touch um touch base with them and i'd say in terms of uh eating today um had little extra dessert that probably didn't need today but uh they was hard workout so my legs are pretty sore and um we'll see how feel tomorrow today started with probably not enough sleep um my sleeping hours uh were little later than usual um had plenty of energy early in the day and then i'd say around o'clock got um fairly tired but didn't want to take nap because thought it would uh hinder tonight sleep and there wasn't whole lot of anything going on today just kind of went through the emotions feel um dealing with people who are just normal friends noth nobody no new connections made today um in the my free time just did work that had due um this upcoming week um nothing particularly noteworthy uh or difficult um felt felt fine today um just uh wish got my normal sleep because tomorrow have to get up particularly early for practice uh so think that are the big key are my sleep and that leads to more productivity today started off early with me waking up at 530 in the morning for um 700 am practice which think actually kickstarted my day on good note uh noticed had i'd say normal amount of energy even though woke up earlier um but was noticeably more positive and i'd say more personable today even had somebody comment on uh me being in uh good mood which was uh didn't mean always try to be as positive as can but didn't think that waking up at 530 would help that um with that said um after dinner was pretty tired and uh didn't have as much energy as wanted to get some work done but that work isn't due till the end of the week so it no problem during the day uh spent lot of time uh at baseball both in the morning and afternoon with class in between and then did homework after class um so it was really uh bookend my day was bookended with the baseball activity with uh school work in between today started off on good note with good night sleep felt well-rested then went and got breakfast and had good amount of time before my first class and didn't have ton of work to get done so the work that did have to do or uh yeah that due tomorrow just kinda took it slow and wasn't particularly like determined to get it done very quickly or um anything like that which guess is noteworthy then had ton of class two sections back to back and then class an hour-and-a-half lecture right after that so had tw three and half hours of class in row right over lunch so made peanut butter and jelly and ate that during class during lecture but then ran to lunch and got the tail-end of lunch and sat down with somebody who met um before but never really chatted with and so we had good conversation with him and the other kid he was sitting with so it was fun um to get to know that two guys then had good good lift uh with the team and then went back to back to uh dinner with my with the team uh when got back to the dorm uh my roommate wasn't um in the best mood because he um got an bad news today but th think did my best to try and help him through that situation and just talk to him about it nothing awful awful but uh definitely tough situation that he needs that tried to help him work through um and then met friend after that and didn't really do any work this evening uh now it time for bed today was normal day with no apparent highs or lows felt pretty even-keeled all day um three classes today so that took up the majority of my time but will say time in between classes and after classes felt particularly don't know if particularly productive is the right word but felt like was always doing work not overwhelmed by the work but always felt like was getting was always getting work done which was good feeling and didn't feel like wasted whole lot of time today no baseball today which meant that focused on school um in terms of interactions with people i'd say did have dinner with some people that um had only met quickly in the past and so that was cool to have conversation with them and uh yeah make some connections with them uh after dinner worked with first independently on work and was very productive and then uh when buddy showed up we got some work done together as well and yeah that just really [inaudible] so we kinda chill out uh tonight i'll hopefully get good night sleep and have good day tomorrow today started waking up feeling like got good night sleep went to breakfast and then had time before my first class to get some reading done that due tomorrow and felt productive in that i'd say hour block of time then class was good no problem and then around the lunch hour uh that was some down time to decompress eat um talk with friends and uh ev got to chat with my dad which is good to touch base with him uh and talk with him on the phone then went to lecture and then to uh practice which was long it was practice and then after practice it was uh workout [lift] which uh was long but felt like my focus didn't waiver in was always doing something which uh felt good and then right from there [inaudible] ate dinner and ran to my office hour for um problem [set] class due tomorrow and that was really beneficial got lot out of that um that was super helpful and felt productive during that uh block of time as well after that met up with some friends to uh to work through some problem and then called it night um all in all felt very productive in my little free time had which always makes me feel good don't think wasted any time today didn't really have much time to waste so uh that that pressure of the time actually think helped me today with my productivity and uh with that said um good amount of the work was with other people so uh wasn't completely isolated today today was pretty even-keel day i'd say it started went really right from breakfast to class to lunch to class to baseball uh then right to and then got right to work getting some work done that was it due monday and then to dinner and then back to some work that wanted to get done also due monday um that knowing that tomorrow probably lot of work won't get done felt uh could focus on work that due in the future considering there tests next week in one class and just know i'll get more work um wouldn't say was stre was definitely not stressed out about it but did feel determined to get it done and did uh it pretty underwhelming night really didn't do much of anything just kinda hung out with some friends and then came back to the dorm and now am going to bed and will hopefully plan on having uh good day tomorrow today was good day which started with uh waking up at reasonable hour and getting breakfast and then actually getting some good uh productive reading done this morning and then headed over to the football game which was good social event um hung out with some friends and then had very long baseball practice which was good it was uh fun just long um but it was uh no stress super uh super we kept it super fun and then uh dinner and then went out um to party or two and had fun there dealing with um people met some new people which was good and had uh some good conversations with them uh yeah it was fun meeting new people there wasn't whole lot of stress today uh if any and i'd say it was plus day uh with uh almost all of my time was um with others and if wasn't with others was in my room doing little bit of reading but not just one reading assignment looking back on today it was really just doing schoolwork and eating today funny as that sounds uh got up later than usual and started reading then went to eat got went to th right to the library and worked pretty much until my computer died then um came back and had snack and changed think what helped me today was switched uh the subject that was working in and then uh kept working till dinner and got that one uh paper done before dinner and then after dinner was all studying for my first uh midterm exam which is this upcoming thursday and i'm going to bed before an early morning practice at 700 am tomorrow uh set list of things needed to get done today and uh got to almost all of it um just one study guide didn't complete uh for the test thursday but that wanted to get done so guess wish got that done and uh felt like could have but um the really no interactions or meaningful interactions other than with my roommates and few friends at meals other than that it was just working day today started bright and early with 700 am conditioning practice this morning um which think benefits my day um getting up that early and starting with some physical exercise actually have more energy and then feel more awake during the academic part of my day after that uh after the conditioning went um and ate and then went to class um yeah and then in in between got some miscellaneous work done um really any spare time had today was doing some sort of work either getting ahead or filling out study guide or um doing other work uh then in the afternoon my it was nice to see my mom who picked me up and took me to the doctor for my back which have been long-term injury uh stress fracture which have been it been healing for months and months but it still not better but um and that that seems to always be on my mind my back sort of since spring every day that really like priority that always been on my mind but it was good seeing my mom and uh the doctor [inaudible] status quo so that was to be expected um then got back uh after dinner with mom and really just did as much work as could until um felt like wasn't being uh as productive or i'd finished with what wanted to get done and then went and now i'm going to bed but overall felt really determined to get the work done and had really really good focus today started with waking up before my alarm on my own naturally um and think it worth noting i've seen think feel better when wake up naturally which uh uh is would be before the alarm um and feel like have more energy even if might be getting little bit less sleep for whatever reason um and especially like if go back to bed after getting up or waking up it going to the bathroom or whatever it just not the same and end up being more groggy than before so got up earlier than anticipated and um got some solid work in after after breakfast but before class and then had class for gosh three and half hours in row in the middle of the day and then uh even got little bit of work done before uh team workout at 500 which really felt like really needed it was good de-stressor for today um had have just like good amount of work more work than usual but nothing crazy at all um and that changed when my test scheduled for thursday was rescheduled for next tuesday so um that definitely lightened the load as well but the workout was uh really good and um like said much needed felt like um left feeling tired and sore after the workout but will say during dinner after workout was dead tired dead tired um and so think the physical uh tiredness hu in my legs from the workout just took it out of me and um took my overall energy just just drained so it was much tougher to get motivated to do work this evening and really didn't need to get whole lot more done um and got whatever needed to get done done but it just was at slow pace um with friend and just not all that focused like earlier in the day today was fairly uneventful day feel like uh was very productive um before my classes or not before but in between my classes and um yeah before classes bef-before the evening and then once the evening hit my productivity just kinda hit wall and wasn't all that determined to get my work done uh have on wednesdays have lot of classes um but don't even think that quote-unquote took lot out of me it was just just my mood don't know what it was um really um looking back wish had got more done but it was also difficult material and um might need help on it tomorrow so receive the help that need um to get it done tomorrow then in terms of dealing with people chatted with my dad today which was awesome then got the rundown on how the family doing and everything um so time for bed today was interesting because only really have one assignment of work due tomorrow but it was big old set that uh had good amount done but god it took me while to do it with um some classmates so that was the majority of my work outside of class and practice but um with that said uh was at prac was at baseball from after my two th after my class ended at 230 so would say from o'clock all the way till 630 645 um and so that um was the majority of my day and before and after that [inaudible] class was just all working of this set which felt had good amount of uh focus on and was um pretty determined to get it uh done and do it well uh my night really included just going to office hours and then working with others after the office hours to figure it out which felt good um i'd say my energy level was um was good throughout the day and then in the afternoon when had practice it really dipped felt but then during the workout at 500 530 to 630 i'd say hit had second wind and um rode that energy [that] felt really energized during and after so um yeah rode that energy throughout to get the work done and now am here going to bed today was another uneventful day unfortunately say um got up went to class um and had some work due in those class so um those was uh those went fine and then in the afternoon went right over to baseball um and had practice but it uh might think it today was don't know why today was tougher than usual uh mentally because uh because i'm injured can't participate so don't know think it just noteworthy those today was um it was tougher on me mentally the the fact those couldn't participate um so then did what could um in the gym after riding the bike got some energy out which think helped then just went back and got some work done um crushed math problem set uh crushed some assignment due in econ and um those made me feel good about it myself and then just hung out with friends didn't really do anything because i've got early morning tomorrow um and now going to bed today was again day that started bright and early uh woke up early uh to get to baseball and we had bus that went to the other side of massachusetts for scrimmage today and uh it was long it was cold and think the worse part was didn't get to play because i'm injured so today was the first day first game that had to miss mean it just scrimmage and think the think the injury will heal but it just tough being on sidelined doing other duties during the game and not being able to participate so that might've taken toll on me mentally but other than that the bus ride there was long but got little work done studying done then after the game got little studying done and then just hung out with mean hung out with friends but goodness the whole day was baseball from uh 700 am till 700 no 800 830 pm so it was all of my day and then the little time could did work today was tough day i'm doing the recording little early because was just reflecting on my day and thought it would make more sense to do it now uh i'd say first um think all the stress that um was putting off kind of hit today and and the stress being um three my first three midterm exams are [inaudible] are in two-day span on tuesday wednesday this week um my back injury that still isn't healing that i've had for months and months and months um has kind of been hurting so uh that two um that two factors kind of played into my day um actually went to lunch with friend and few friend and one of their parents took us to lunch which was nice to meet them um and felt fully engaged in that and but the stress did not impact that at all but once got back and settled in just started doing work started to study got frustrated um not as productive as wanted to be um but guess mean looking back was fairly productive um and so just out of nowhere my dad reached out and just about something else and uh he could tell that wasn't doing too well so uh mom and dad came took us to dinner tonight and so that support was incredible um really lucky to has family close by um and yeah just touching base with them was uh was really positive um now early early morning tomorrow with 700 are practice which mean i'm gonna try to get to bed early think lack of sleep the last night or last few night are doing lot it kind of piled up so think it worthwhile to get the week off on the right foot by having good night sleep tonight and think that really impact my uh my day today was very productive day because didn't have much other choice um it started early with with baseball conditioning 700 am and as much as um would like to sleep little longer think it kick-starts my day um then went to class and after class wrote out hour by hour what was gonna do studying-wise and stuck to that plan and really just studied from 100 to dinner time and then after dinner kept studying um will say that i'm feeling little sick especially um stomach bugs stomach ache and may be getting little congested so that two together um made it little harder to concentrate than would've liked to but um all in all felt like got the work that needed to get done um and wanna get good night sleep for tomorrow exams today was uh first for me um first to college midterm exams um in the books um feel as if um they went well uh honestly uh do think they took lot out of me not lot out of me they they was they they was like normal test at they was what expected um but just the fact that had let see oh over three hours of test-taking today um that um prevented me from being able to focus on studying for tomorrow exams uh as much as wanted to guess um with that said tomorrow exams will definitely be harder than today two um or than the two today and i'd say little little anxious more just not knowing what to expect know they hard and feel like i've put in the time but don't know if understand the information as well as would like um so little bit of uh anxiousness with that coming down otherwise felt little the stomach bug is little better um not ideal um but uh think good night sleep will help have early morning tomorrow o'clock workout so time for bed today started uh with good with good note had 830 am lift that uh think kickstarted my day and um it was good felt productive um definitely needed workout today and i'm glad got it um think said before love the the uh tired feeling after workout um with my muscles so like that was good um feeling and it felt like needed to get it in especially knowing the rest of my day was went from the workout to class to lunch to two hours of review for um big exam to two hours of more class and then um studied little dinner and the exam so the day was really building up to the exam from 730 to 900-ish and that was definitely my toughest exam uh but at the end of the day think it'll all work out don't think did amazing but i'm not wasn't too stressed about it which was which was good uh going to bed now uh and feel good that all my midterms am over so far today was good low-stress day after my three midterm exams the past two day um today was pretty pretty low pretty pretty low-key not whole like said no real stressors today uh didn't have class till 1100 so got up uh got some things done before then then went to class um till 230 then headed over to practice and lift um where felt like got good lift in and ate dinner and then got only had one homework assignment done so did that with teammate got that done uh fairly quickly and thought i'd be in bed lot earlier than am which guess i'm little upset with about my about myself but um you know what called home and chatted with the folks for long time which was good and um that call was well worth um going to bed little later so all in all good uh low-stress day think more of the same it will be tomorrow today was great day and uh including last night when came went back home and saw good amount of my friends uh from high school who came home for columbus day weekend uh we hung out last night and slept over uh friends house and then woke up and went home today and saw my mom dad and surprised my brother which was great seeing him um haven't been able to see him as much so that was awesome spent some time with him and this afternoon went with um the same friends to college football game and where saw even more people from my high school um and we so we all just met up and went to the game and uh had blast uh hanging out before the game um and during the game and met some uh good amount of new people uh like roommates and friends at this college so um super i'd say seeing my friends from high school it was uh it was probably damn near the most happy i've been uh since i've been away at school absolutely just seeing him was just the best um and that carried through the whole day was uh super super happy super uh enthusiastic and uh now i'm going to sleep back in the dorm because have to get up for baseball tomorrow today was baseball day started early and going to the field and we played two games back to back so was in the locker room at 815 and didn't get out of the locker room till 630 at night so was there all day with my team playing another local school which was fun we played super well um uh i'm still injured which wasn't uh as bad today usually it it always on my mind and it is always on my mind but today the energy was better think my think was more positive today um then just did the best job could as teammate and that guess at all that all can do after the games went and grabbed dinner with my father in [redacted] and it was good to have little one-on-one with him just talking talking about everything really um that was uh definitely highlight of the day um hung out with some friends this evening and going to bed now today started uh getting up doing some chores around the dorm um or cleaning like cleaning and stuff like that and and then got lunch and with uh some friends at the dining hall uh before that got one assignment done that due wednesday after lunch went over to the baseball facilities and had conditioning practice and after that spent time with the team uh watching the red sox game on television unfortunately they lost um but uh we watched that with good amount of the guys uh in the locker room uh then went to dinner at the dining hall and got back to the dorm and just sat down and started writing um paper due friday but wanna get they done early um because of other assignment that'll be due later in the week so um hopefully i'll be able to be productive didn't get as much of they done as wanted but feel like guess i'm in good spot and hopefully will be able to do they tomorrow morning uh in terms of spending time with other people today um didn't mind the alone time today for whatever reason uh just being trying to be as productive as could um with the work had today started uh at reasonable hour thought got good amount of hour of sleep but felt felt tired waking up which is odd because think got at least eight hour of sleep so uh that was something noteworthy um went got breakfast um well before class and in that window of time i'd say hour and ha two hour hour and half before class started got some uh good work done and finished up paper was told myself was gonna finish it and did um so that felt good felt productive then went to class um tuesdays have class from 1100 to 230 uh and then at 230 um got lunch and then we had baseball meeting and then baseball meeting to uh team workout uh which was particularly tough workout felt um yeah didn't feel as strong as did with doing the same workout last week which was um noteworthy again uh got dinner after and then tried to do some the econ problem set which is due friday um but wasn't really all that focused wasn't didn't really have the drive to do it was kinda burnt out think and so mean only got like the first problem done and then uh went to brain break and socialized just hang out and now i'm going to bed today started waking up uh before my alarm and uh going to the bathroom then when went back to sleep uh after getting up to the alarm had less energy uh than had gotten up without the alarm uh think that noteworthy and tomorrow morning if it happens again think might just get up and start my day um otherwise very bland day um nothing particularly noteworthy uh class went by fine um nothing standing out as particularly um hard um an uh had dinner with um an actually met new person at dinner which was uh cool to talk to them uh and then just did work uh with buddy which was productive uh for assignment due friday um think the workload um has died down since midterms was last week uh so that relief so i'm feeling better about that um in general guess feel like wish had more time to do um not baseball and not school work so uh just an free time whether it be just to read or um for pleasure or um do an things just not baseball or school-related that really all i'm feeling uh in addition today my back was pretty tight um caused an discomfort um again i'm has an injury uh there but um it was particularly uncomfortable all day so i'll try and get that um sorted out tomorrow this morning started off um waking up before my alarm and getting up out of bed before my alarm uh so think when my body naturally got up just made the most sense to get up and start my day um it was good because had class didn't start till 1100 so got to go over to the athletics um across the river and get some physical therapy in for my back which was sore today um so got that um did some work with that uh went to class no problem at all um could focus fine uh went back across the river for practice and lift um where felt again felt fine just kinda normal no-not too high not too low um had dinner and then went and did um problem set due tomorrow uh with others at office hours and um i'd say had moderate focus i'd say had most of it done and just needed some had few questions um but yeah i'd just say moderately focused not um not my best not my worst um and now after that finished that so time for bed today was fairly normal day i'd say noticed at some points my had positive demeanor was pretty pretty happy looking forward think maybe it 'cause it was friday looking forward to the weekend um but yeah uh classes went fine and uh but was looking forward to the baseball conditioning workout today um and just had to plan for the afternoon to get better and stuck to it and uh made me feel good um after um after practice went to um basketball event um at their new gym which was fun to uh socialize with friends and see the basketball team play um and then really didn't do much else just uh watched some baseball um back at the dorm and then now going to sleep no nothing uh too high or too low today today started with big window of time that utilized to get some work done to get ahead on the week uh just went to breakfast and started doing homework and did homework till till lunchtime and um feel like could have been little bit more productive with the time but um think always feel that way uh after lunch went to baseball for the whole afternoon and um it tough because can't participate so do as much as can uh afterwards went out to dinner and then went out uh this evening and uh had good time uh with some friends and met some new people which was nice uh going to bed now uh and i'll hopefully have productive schoolwork day tomorrow today started little later than usual but you know what that was fine um had no real obligations today uh so tried to make the most of my time uh this morning got some studying done um for test on thursday and did some preliminary research for term paper uh then uh worked on that two things for while then went to lunch and after lunch uh later in the afternoon took nap which was um was from like 330 to 400 which think needed and definitely helped me then tried to get some studying done for econ unit review um was not particularly motivated or focused to do that um as is the case with me and econ unfortunately uh after dinner took the unit review uh was pretty um worried didn't do well but uh ended up being fine uh then it was good to unwind at the end of the day watching baseball with my roommates and friend watched some playoff baseball um and that was definitely uh definitely fun uh looking back had good outlook on today don't know think it maybe because didn't have any obligations had positive don't know happy demeanor for whatever i'd notice myself uh maybe it was because didn't really have anything uh that had to do just made the most of my time today started um with morning workout at 800 am with the team and really enjoyed um the timing getting up little bit earlier than usual but not too early where felt like lost sleep felt like had enough energy during the workout felt really good after um yeah think it was uh productive and felt good uh was thinking when note that in the in the survey that feel under the weather it just because my my back still gives me some still aches um so for the i'd i'd note if was sick in in audio in the audio survey but uh moving on to the day uh felt like had plan for the day and felt really productive um getting ahead of the week work-wise uh today uh and uh so lot of my time was spent alone uh in the library doing work but you know felt fine doing that no problem at all uh and all the better because feel like got uh ahead with my work uh just kinda chilled out with the roommates uh after uh doing work till don't know about o'clock and uh now it time for bed i'd say today was fairly lazy workday uh didn't have class till 1100 um and just got some things done in the morning not necessarily schoolwork related just more logistical things um admin things and then uh had tuesdays have class from 1100 to twe to 230 all in row back to back to back um and uh-uh it wasn't too like mentally draining the class aren't particularly uh difficult today so uh felt good after that and went straight to the field uh and uh got to increased my participation today um was cleared to do some more things which was great uh that was very encouraging that um ver was very excited about that that was it was big day for me to begin [inaudible] allowed to start throwing um very lightly but just that was uh very big for me uh after that uh went and worked out with uh team [redacted] and that was productive felt um felt pretty strong uh felt healthy um and then ate uh dinner and didn't really don't have any work to do tomorrow so just kind of went to the library and uh hung out chatted with friends um and didn't and tried to get some work done but just didn't really have the motivation to do any so now trying to get good night sleep for tomorrow this morning got up um on my own without the alarm and felt good and fairly well-rested so got up and started my day uh didn't get anything done at breakfast but just ha could take my time and just kinda chilled out before 1000 am class uh then in between 1000 am class uh and noon class tried to get some reading done uh fairly successful then uh had another break between my 12 o'clock class and my o'clock class so was productive in that block of time uh studying for test that is tomorrow uh and similarly after after my o'clock class got dinner and uh was fairly productive in the evening so felt good about um how used my time uh no workout today which was nice to recover uh from yesterday lift uh and uh i'm going to sleep now to uh hopefully have good

with team lift um felt good felt strong uh no problems there off to uh class and afterwards uh and in between class actually saw my mom she came to drop something off um that needed uh so that was good to see her to catch up just even for what was it 10 minutes but um that was good then um felt really prepared for class felt don't know felt uh felt good uh all afternoon had time actually then

particularly difficult so overall felt productive felt good today was overall positive day uh feel good don't didn't get whole lot of schoolwork done if any but i'm not too concerned with that because of the amount of work got in yesterday had meeting with my uh academic advisor went well this morning uh good to touch base with her then had lot of class from 1100 to 230 uh back to back to back and then um got good test score back on midterm made me feel good um about that then went to baseball and uh had fun there um kept it loose um not stressful at all and uh coach gave me some good news about uh next summer as to where i'll be playing which was not definitive but got the uh made me feel really good really excited i'm really excited about that that um that was uh something had been thinking about and know it not definitive but going moving in the right direction with that then ate dinner with some of the teammates and went back to the room and watched the world series game and uh didn't didn't do any work but told myself wasn't expecting to get any work done so just kinda chilled out and now it is time for time for bed today started with pretty awful night sleep uh it was super hot in the room last night and uh woke up at about 400 am think and couldn't fall back asleep till like 530 am it was terrible it was oh like it was super super hot um super uncomfortable and uh took me lot to fall back asleep uh which usually do not have problem with uh so th guess thought i'd have less energy than did uh but it was all right it was all right uh felt fine in class maybe little bit yeah felt fine in class and uh felt productive in the afternoon uh and will say during my th o'clock to o'clock class it felt like an eternity really didn't have whole lot of focus or energy in that period of time at all but after that got an work done with an classmates got dinner then kept working with an classmates went back to the dorm watched an baseball and now i'm going um to bed early um maybe to make up for an of last night sleep uh and have to get up uh little earlier tomorrow for uh baseball so uh we will see today again started with not the greatest night sleep uh woke up right around the same time in the morning at about 400 am and it took me while to fall back asleep unfortunately uh fell back to sleep uh got up in at 700 and went to uh baseball uh where we just had short little hour uh practice which was good inside uh then went to class uh class was class was good in even before class was productive got some homework that was due tomorrow done uh then uh went to went back to uh to lunch and then back to class where we had guest speaker which was uh interesting then right back to the baseball um right back across the river and just kinda chilled out in the locker room tried to get some work done but didn't really have real plan of uh getting stuff done so usually if don't have plan usually don't get any much done so uh then went to uh went to lift had good lift uh went to dinner and uh then went to office hour to get my uh problem [set] done which was there was so many people little overwhelming ha-had most of it done but only had question on the last part and had to wait for everybody which think was little uh wouldn't say short tempered but just uh impatient uh would say was im pretty impatient uh but all in all uh no complaints today today started with getting much better night sleep than the last two night uh think woke up naturally before my alarm and uh felt much better uh then got up and went to breakfast uh and between breakfast and class had some like leisure time just kind of chilled out uh which hadn't been able to do for while uh then just read little pleasure reading it was fun it was good then uh from last till from class till lunch to class um and then from class to uh big big uh uh conditioning day uh it was very tough workout and uh but there was like little challenge that we had to do uh on the bike and met it but just barely and mean it was brutal but felt so so much better afterwards even though was very very tired very sore so uh then went got back tried to get little work done uh moderately successfully and then got dinner um and i've noticed i've been uh making point to eat uh healthy very lat always ate healthy but um now really in the past week or so really uh killing it on what um i'm putting in my body and uh don't know if it physically helped me any but think mentally it makes me feel better i've noticed uh then went uh and hung out with some of the baseball guys and now time for bed this morning started up waking naturally then got some breakfast and then did some work um up until when my parents came for uh the parents weekend football tailgate um where uh we went to little bit of the game and my parents met some of my friends' parents so that was good we then went out to lunch and we just had good meal and it was great to catch up with them mean they're not that far away from home at all so it wasn't as big of deal as it was for other people uh then came back to the dorm and chatted with friend from home for while which was great to catch up with them uh and then did some more work until dinnertime ate dinner by myself [inaudible] with their parents so then came back and uh watched uh the world series by myself talking to my roommates who wasn't here tonight uh or it was out and just didn't have any motivation to go out and socialize uh didn't mind just keeping to myself tonight uh now it time for bed this morning woke up and uh felt fairly well rested went to the gym to get like little little workout in on by myself and uh felt good after uh then went to the dining hall and no exaggeration spent almost my like my the whole day there uh ate did work ate did work ate then did did practice test or unit review and then came back uh with friend and the roommates to uh watch little baseball world series which they are currently doing now and i'm in bed uh spent most of my day alone just with my my laptop and my work um will say good amount of they was doing uh some well doing the psych surveys the study surveys and then also some other uh surveys that had to do uh but other than that they was just work work and eat and that why felt like needed to uh get lift in this morning uh because knew what my always plan my day so knew what was ahead uh time for bed now 'cause have morning lift tomorrow this morning started wake [inaudible] about 645 to get to um team lift at 800 am uh felt little tired at the beginning uh th took me little bit longer than would have expected to wake up af but after that uh felt like was productive had breakfast went to class and then had lunch went to class um and then from o'clock on was free to do uh whatever so got uh work done that was uh assigned today and then have to uh have term paper due thanksgiving break so uh wrote the first page of that uh which uh feel good about uh ate dinner and after dinner really just chilled out tried to get some work done but wasn't focused at all and then just said whatever i'll just uh chill out so at the beginning of the day was uh with people then in the afternoon was just kinda by myself doing my own thing working uh then the same thing at night just kinda chilled out by myself pretty low-key uh going to bed now 'cause i'm trying to get some good quality sleep tonight uh especially since uh lifted today uh and we'll see today was good day at uh started waking up little earlier than wanted to but uh got up and got to breakfast and had some time before my first class got little bit of work done not as productive as would have liked to be but um i'll take it and class uh didn't go great but that was as it collectively as class we felt that way um so that was little frustrating but uh then went to section which was easy and for another class and then uh class afternoon class was cancelled so had the opportunity to get lunch and head down to the um locker room early where uh didn't really have the motivation to do any work uh naturally down at the athletic field at the uh locker room so uh took my time uh warming up just really lengthened everything out and uh which was uh fun then had good lift and had big dinner and then had second dinner after that uh so ate little bit more today uh was little light on the scale so uh ate little extra but still ate healthy feeling good uh and going to bed soon today started with awful night sleep uh started tracking my sleep just few days ago on an app and got well under seven hours of sleep last night like six and half hours of sleep but was in bed for eight and half hours have been getting up in the middle of the night having to go to the bathroom more and more woke up [inaudible] um didn't feel whole lot uh more tired but mean felt little bit uh was little tired during the first class then uh just not little tired during the second class uh then after my second class came back to the dorm and uh took nap which never really do but and felt like it would be beneficial and during my 300 to 500 seminar wasn't super focused but then all of sudden at like o'clock was like hit with like 430 hit with wave of energy and uh decided to like hey before dinner go to the go to the gym and ride the bike just do an core core work and just little quick little by myself and that was that was the last thing would have expected uh if asked myself this morning so the nap helped hopefully it won't um prevent me from sleeping tonight don't think it will and uh now i'm just uh chilling out with um my roommate and friend watching the world series and uh hopefully get better night sleep tonight again today started with not the greatest night sleep uh woke up uh and fin fall back asleep uh so that think impacted my energy level especially at the end of the day uh woke up went to breakfast then before my first class uh did some last-minute studying review and just had quiz and one class then to lunch then to um lecture which was easy then to practice which uh went fine um normal and then to lift which also went fine went normal was little bit more tired than usual i'd say during lift and practice uh and then to dinner then to office hours to finish problem set uh at the last minute last-minute questions so was tired during that as well so that why i'm going to bed right now and it 10 o'clock hopefully i'll be able to get good night sleep tonight today started with uh better night sleep uh but did uh wake up and felt super sore like my muscles and my back in particular which is still not fully healed um yeah super tight super sore which was unfortunate uh got up went to breakfast then went to uh class to then another um psych study then to um lecture which wasn't super engaged in but think that was more so the lecture than me then headed over to uh quick lunch and then to the to lift or to conditioning rather today um where um felt tight felt little uh not as strong little sore but um but performed fine um and then went to uh dinner or actually got little bit uh just little reading done uh and then to dinner then to the hockey game then uh after the hockey game ate big burrito which probably wasn't the most necessary but was hungry so uh and had some more food too the day uh ate good amount today uh now and didn't really have any motivation to go out and socialize tonight being on the hockey game uh so back to them dorm and uh gonna get to bed now today started waking up earlier than wanted to uh and then going back to sleep although it took me while uh think it'd be worth noting that press the button on my wristband when try to fall asleep and actually fall asleep 10 15 minutes normal um but press it in the morning after stop trying to fall asleep with that said there might be days where i'm up for over an hour trying to fall back asleep so the window of time between the button press aren't how long i'm sleeping it how long i'm trying to sleep and haven't been as good of sleeper as wanted to be but with that said today felt productive uh set an goals that knew what wanted to get done and got them done uh went to [redacted] and really just uh did as much work as could uh yeah no uh no problems there felt good and then tried to take nap later this this afternoon and just laid in bed for half an hour unsuccessfully falling asleep but think just laying there helped uh then just went over an notes on study guide for an exam tuesday uh had dinner and then uh reached out to my parents and asked if could uh it were in the city so it came and picked me up and asked if could go home in their now i'm home slee uh sleeping in my own bed think that'll be good for my sleep schedule and my back and everything just get me get me back back on track um awesome seeing them and the brother uh and yeah gonna use this time at home to catch up on good sleep and uh spend time with family and get an studying done tomorrow at home today felt great waking up in my own bed at home uh significantly more comfortable than the bed here um and as silly as it sounds think that my sleep quality in the dorm is just not comparable to what could get at home from the bed to the noise to the light to everything so felt great waking up in real bed um having uh home-cooked breakfast um was great then did little bit of work studying for midterms then went and got lunch with one of my best friends who also just happened to be home for the weekend he goes to school around here so i've seen him but uh good to get lunch with him uh just chill out talk and then got back spent some time with my dad and played catch with him uh which was pretty much the only physical activity did today then uh did more practice exams and studying uh until dinner had dinner and then uh at home and then went uh got driven back to campus where took another practice exams so lot of studying today but mixed in with time with uh my friends and family which was good just to talk to talk to the fam and just catch up with him uh early morning lift tomorrow so time for bed again today started with just okay sleep not great uh was up for at least an hour during the night unable to fall asleep but then had morning lift which think gave me an energy then um so ate before lift ate after lift then went to uh class which was fine and uh ate again and then went to an amazing um really really good lecture with guest speaker um and then that ended at o'clock uh it was good to catch up with my friend uh facetime called with him for good amount of time hadn't been able to uh talk with him recently so that was good then uh just did homework studying all afternoon and all night felt productive in the afternoon before dinner and then after dinner just really didn't wasn't as focused didn't get as much done as wanted to so we will see how that fares on the exams the next few day uh going to bed think i'm gonna try and get good amount of work done before class tomorrow today started fi um with little better night sleep uh tried sleeping in the uh common room on the futon and um get up in the middle of the night every night and definitely fell asleep faster um fell back asleep faster last night so trying it again tonight uh in the morning studied for an exam had today then um and then went to class went to class and then had the exam this afternoon think it went well we'll see um feel fine about it then went over to the locker room and uh played catch and then had team lift uh and felt good uh little sore uh in the back um but um after that got dinner and then just really didn't have much motivation to study for my exam tomorrow which definitely need to study for but i'll hopefully get an studying in tomorrow go to review session and hopefully that'll get me ready uh started waking up little bit earlier than i'd anticipated but didn't feel tired or like um needed more sleep so uh got up and uh had breakfast with friend at the dining hall and then um uh tried to get some studying done uh before class and then had class and then had lunch then had good uh review session for some exam today uh that uh needed to uh study lot for so not lot but just had some questions that got answered uh which is great um then this uh afternoon um my seminar had uh guest um visitor um uh former mlb player who uh also studied uh what the class is about uh and he was great super nice super cool to uh meet and talk with him uh connected with him right off the bat uh then we chatted for while which is great uh then after dinner had uh mid-term exam which don't think went particularly well but after talking with my peers it don't seem like anybody thought he did particularly well think everybody thought it was hard um so that made me feel better um after the exam surprisingly had lot of energy so decided to just go for jog around the block and try and get that energy out and now it is time for bed think got good night sleep last night and uh that led to uh pretty good day today um tried to get as much of my homework done before my 1100 am class started and then uh had breakfast with uh friend uh at the dining hall and after uh class had quick lunch with some of my friend and then went to interesting lecture which was great and then uh spent long time at the uh at baseball between practice and lift and then uh have noticed felt really really motivated the last few day i've been uh yeah noticeably um more motivated think i've been reading about um the life of certain person and uh just been taking lessons from that uh after had had dinner by myself um which was honestly fine just to unwind and be by myself for little bit of the day uh usually like little bit of time to myself honestly so uh that was good and then continued to do some homework uh all the way till about 1000-ish maybe 930 maybe and then uh came back here and to the dorm and now going to bed um felt felt good today especially think after the exams my um was more at ease um and that was probably just because had less work on my mind so um going to bed now for uh hopefully good day tomorrow today was good day started uh waking up at normal hour and actually had little bit of time between breakfast and class to um just um hang out and read for pleasure no stress of doing work and then went to class which was fine but it uh getting little bit harder um and then uh so that class has lot of work coming up so tried to do most of that or most of my free time today was spent doing that but it uh like said getting harder and harder so uh we will survive uh after class went to um the the locker room and had conditioning and um which was uh tough and then did lift after that don't know made me feel good felt really good uh after so then uh had meal with my friends at the dining hall hung out with them for little bit and then came back to the dorm and tried to get as much work done as could so that free time tried to get work but got little frustrated with it um and um now it time for bed today started um little later than usual since got to bed so late uh because my friends were over yesterday uh woke up didn't feel good at all um and um yeah didn't feel good at all and so that prevented me from being super productive um in like the earlier part of my day guess you could say um because if don't get my normal sleep just feel like awful so that why i'm going to bed right now um and because have to get up early tomorrow but were stressing out today over my paper that have to write and uh talked to my mom and she uh and we were just would call because um not for that but then we ended up talking about that and she helped me guess just talking don't know and uh so that um were the majority of my day spent working on this paper um and that really it no physical exercise no anything just um just just working on that really spent lot of time alone um in library today um tomorrow we have morning lift so time for bed now today started early with team lift at 800 am got to bed early last night and uh woke up and felt like got enough sleep um uh had fine lift and then um rushed to uh rushed to class uh which was um not ideal but um not problem then and then ate lunch and then went to class after that um after that ate again and um then my mother came to pick me up and took me to the uh doctor which got some good news about the progress of my uh back injury and uh what can and can't do going forward and hopefully timetable for that which uh was great news um got some good news about um uh just something at home which was great um and then had nice dinner with my mom little celebration uh which was um which was awesome uh looking back ate lot today but feel good about it after working out felt like uh could eat and when did and felt felt like ate healthy which mentally just always makes me feel good um had um good breakfast and i'd say two lunch and then uh snacks and big dinner then um big snacks later so um regardless um in the uh like dead time that did have um cranked out as much work as could um and was actually fairly productive in the time that spent doing work which made me feel good um time for bed now today started getting up after what think it was good night sleep felt well-rested and uh got little bit of work done before classes which was good which think i'll plan on doing tomorrow um i've figured out that my mornings are when i'm most productive um as opposed to what most people get done during night just can't do so tomorrow mornings hopefully i'll get something done i'm working on this big paper and it taking up way more time than had anticipated so um that really the only thing that been causing me any distress um that on top of um math exam thursday which uh [inaudible] won't be particularly easy guess doesn't help so hmm that what on my mind uh preparing for that and uh lot of classes tomorrow but um no baseball so that means i'll use any and all dead time have to uh get work done and either write or study um good amount of my day was spent uh by myself with my computer just study uh writing it research paper so it more research than writing to be honest which doesn't particularly like so that just kinda been sucking for the last week and it due in week so time for bed we'll see today was good productive workday uh set my alarm purposefully little bit earlier to get um some writing done before my first class which uh started at 1000 today so got um some good amount of well got some writing in and then uh went to class um and then to lunch then to class um uh then had little bit of time in between class and my seminar to get some work done uh just little bit and then uh the seminar went well uh the seminar went better than my other two class so just was um mean they went fine but [not yet] average but the seminar went well felt good about that then was productive and did practice exam before dinner ate dinner and then after studied the practice exam uh and then went to uh little meeting with my entryway uh and just chatted about some things and now time for bed um overall most of my day was spent by myself um doing work and was thinking about they and think that feel fine about that um as much as like people and like my friends when don't have problem being alone you know just by myself doing work or not doing work today started uh nice and early woke up at like so well before 630 before my alarm and uh then uh ate little thing in the dorm and headed off to uh across the river to uh baseball where just had nice easy practice um and then went back to uh breakfast and after breakfast and then this is all before my 1100 am so felt productive uh which was felt which was good and then uh had lunch and then went to lecture where um which was easy really uh low key and then headed back over across the river to my workout which was good um felt normal uh not weak not strong just normal which is good uh then came back and ate dinner before an exam um which was difficult so was little bit disappointed with myself uh after that exam um most people thought it was difficult so it puts it in perspective uh but yeah that was unfortunate and that kind of took all the energy out of me to be honest tried to get little work done afterwards but uh with no real success so um pretty lazy night um and going to bed now today wa woke up in um hotel room bed um not had ton of hours of sleep but um felt like the sleep got wa good um had uh had breakfast then um went to the [inaudible] game where there wa big tailgate before interacted with lot of people wa uh fairly social and uh yeah met some new uh met some new faces saw lot of people which wa fun lot of fun uh before the game and went to the game which wa uh not as not as good we um the team didn't do well it wasn't great game but um it wa good to hang out with some friends at the game uh after the game we uh we figured out we had to uh get on shuttle back to uh back to campus so that wa long bus ride but not too bad uh spent lot of just listened to podcast and just kind of chilled out and that wa good didn't sleep but definitely just chilled out um think it wa good for my mind the long the long trip uh then uh hung out in the room with roommate and now it time for bed today was productive day uh got an okay night sleep woke up at 300 am to my roommate snoring and so had to go out to the common room and sleep which sucks and that uh but that didn't affect my productivity today woke up and got lot of work done before lunchtime and um then after lunch finished up my term paper which felt great to get done so two assignments before lunchtime was the goal and knocked that out and the big writing assignments after lunch was the goal to finish and finished well before dinner and had time to hang out with an friends uh after dinner and now going to bed looking back today was was really good day i'm super excited for uh break for thanksgiving i'm le-leaving tomorrow after class and um that was on my mind today i'm just really excited to go to go home uh and see the family and see friends but got up early this morning um and had okay okay night sleep uh got up early to go lift and workout and worked out before my with the team before my 1000 am class and i'll do the same thing tomorrow before my 1100 am class uh felt fine in the gym and actually noticed when woke up my back felt notably noticeably better um but after the lift it tightened up little and went back to normal soreness um but think there progress and but really just my day was uh working out in the morning class lunch class and then right back to the field uh and played catch and did some um training room uh rehab work and uh it felt great didn't

as let say like goal for the day or put it down on my to-do list so maybe that'll be something work on uh felt um spent most of my day um the afternoon anyway uh over with at baseball uh interacting with other people felt um felt good felt um like there was just like positive energy as team which think translated to everybody individually and myself included so felt good about those and academically studied this morning and then took like quiz felt strong about those and then uh after baseball did an-another [inaudible] session and felt good about those so overall felt uh good about my day academically probably could have gotten little bit more work done so looks like i'll do those tomorrow morning today started with what thought was all right-length sleep but uh ended up pretty tired during the day so took nap which usually don't do but took nap around oh think 200 and uh think felt better after um overall had good amount of class today um and was focused in class and uh felt good in class uh and then after um excuse me after dinner tried to uh get ahead on some homework and got the easy stuff done no problem and then once hit some more difficult problem just didn't have much motivation at all um the homework due friday so guess i'm doing that tomorrow evening um yeah but uh even with that not very uh stressful of day uh any day you can get get nap in is is good day um oh before class did get some uh other homework done so did feel productive got what needed to get done um but uh yeah going to sleep now today today was good day uh lot of time spent over across the river uh doing uh baseball stuff which always like uh just love love being over there um whether it in the training room or working out or playing catch um lo love being over there and was went over before classes started at 1100 and um while was over there um got some goo-good work in and then went to classes and then tried to get as much homework done as could between classes um and between my classes then another classes and went right back over to the field um or to the athletics facility um tried to get little bit more work done finished homework assignment and then um and that was kind of stressful to get that done it was pretty hard and knew wouldn't have time because after throwing and having meetings uh baseball meetings and then lifting had office hours which had to do pset and um and then entryway meetings so little stressful in terms of there was no real downtime today but was fairly productive and uh only have little bit more work to do tomorrow morning today started with just an okay night sleep um woke up early and uh tried to get few more hours but couldn't um at least don't think uh was super tired this morning um got up went to breakfast had to finish an homework before class started so got that done and then went to class and was very tired don't know it obviously was just from the sleep or lack of sleep um but still think uh don't know uh then had lunch with professor which was uh fun and with few other students and uh then ran to the next class which went fine and uh that was my last class of the semester so after that uh went to the field or went to the baseball uh locker room and uh got good workout in and after the workout got another uh so the workout was got an more workout in which was good was determined to get it done felt good enough to get it done and wasn't tired and so went for it and felt good after um then had big dinner um and then after dinner was fairly tired um chatted with the folks which was nice to touch base with them hadn't in while and then uh went and hang out with the baseball team for little and now going to bed today started with um uh not great night sleep uh my roommate woke me up in the middle of the night again and uh took while had to go back out to the common room to fall back asleep so sleeping on the futon wasn't ideal um so um was fairly little bit tired um especially in the afternoon so took nap uh and that definitely helped me just like quick 30-minute nap and uh felt better after which was got my energy back up um but today is first day of reading week so spent lot of time planning out the week how i'm gonna study uh little overwhelmed in the amount of time and uh amount of studying to do um it just lot of both lot of time but also lot of stuff to do so it'll be interesting uh tried to get uh have one little writing assignment so started that and uh yeah and in the after the nap had energy went across the river and played catch and worked out and uh noticed that when i'm the that when i'm the happiest is uh playing baseball and working out um all the stress uh kinda go away or whatever whatever on my mind uh talked with the folks today it helped me figure out how i'm gonna rectify my uh sleeping with the roommate and uh yeah so that was my day today started with think really good night sleep um both of my roommates didn't sleep in the dorm so had the room to myself and think that really helped my sleep quality um without doubt um uh was productive today had goal to get three things done and got that three things done and uh made me feel good um in the morning uh got practice test done in the afternoon finished paper and then after dinner did um homework assignment so all in all felt productive um the practice test and the paper was by myself and then the homework was with group of friends uh in the afternoon before dinner went and took long walk to um just to book store didn't get anything but kn-knew wanted to get walk in today so that was my activity for the day and i'm gonna lift tomorrow morning so uh all in all felt good today started with another not great night sleep uh was up from 200 am to 300 am because of my roommate snoring had to move to the common room to sleep on the futon not great night sleep got up early to work out and uh and then play catch um which went well but after that just had like no energy um so at like 1230 tried to take nap wasn't successful so uh but think just relaxing helped my energy level uh [inaudible] so finally um think we uh we am trying different uh setup sleeping arrangement uh hopefully it'll be better i'll be able to sleep through the night for the first time in while so knock on wood with that and so in the morning was okay um and then after that it little uh little bit irritable um it definitely tired and so needed that time to rest um after my uh resting and lunch felt better and got uh some practice um studying in for final and then had dinner and then started study guide for another exam after dinner so ended up getting some work done despite the lack of sleep so hopefully won't have that ch-challenge tomorrow uh today started with good night sleep um finally uh what think was an uninterrupted night sleep which was um because of the we changed the sleeping uh situation and it worked so knock on wood all good night sleep tonight um but could tell like it boosted my energy felt uh more productive didn't need nap in the middle of the day just little stuff like that my mood was better um so think the sleep is key um then did lot of school work or did an uh studying today um after breakfast before lunch and then tried to get an more done after lunch um and before my workout but um yo mean had an easy two two and half hours but just wasn't as productive as would've liked to have been so uh hopefully will be will be better tomorrow um yeah post dinner uh could've been little bit more productive but uh reached out to an old friends and uh talked with them so think that that was valuable um yeah that was good catching up with them um all in all uh felt like good day today started with another good night sleep uh felt like had plenty of energy to get everything wanted to get done today um that included uh practice exam in the morning uh lunch then went down to the uh field and played catch did my training room exercises and rode the exercises bike uh for good sweat uh then came back and uh got another practice exam done um ate dinner and then went right back to the library and finished up some studying um i'd say my ability to focus was uh really good uh my time during the practice exam and studying was all by myself but it was good right in the middle of the day to have to have some time uh with two of my friends who went down together to the field uh so think i'll have the same schedule tomorrow really uh really worked well for me from workload-wise and from uh uh interacting with people having fun uh so that it today started with not as good night sleep at the past few night uh woke up think two times in the middle of the night so not ideal but um um got my practice test done before lunch after breakfast and it took me little bit longer than it may usually would have um then after lunch headed over to the field where uh did my uh the whole training room work and the workout and uh felt pretty good uh then came back and had an early dinner and tried to get an extra studying in before my office hours um wasn't as productive as would have liked to have been my energy was think drained after the workout and uh yeah in office hours was moderately focused um there was just few of me and the tf asking an questions um so overall think could have been little bit more productive uh studying-wise today but we'll uh i'll try to be better tomorrow today started with pretty good night sleep i'd say um woke up and woke up before my alarm uh did um did little meditation did uh breakfast then tried to get some work done um before um some office hours for math then uh tried to squeeze little bit more work in before lunch um so got some stuff done not like uber uber productive but got some work done and after lunch went and uh went to the field played catch uh did my physical therapy did my workout and uh felt pretty good uh to be honest uh came back got dinner and then was really tired really really physically and mentally drained uh but uh tried to get little bit more note-taking studying done uh then kind of eased uh into the night just uh really doing nothing just hanging in the room um hopef-hopefully gonna have productive tomorrow today was uh lot of big school work day um lot of studying finals are next week was glad got good night sleep last night um and think got good eight hours in and uh got up went to practice then went straight to the library um and it was good that um me and uh two friends we went to the library together and worked hard uh individually for um couple hours at time then would go get lunch then work for couple hours then go get snack then work for couple hours get dinner um so it was good felt um logged lot of hours of studying um fairly productive think as well um so lot of time lot of my day was just um well me and my notes and my practice tests and questions and but it was good to uh break up the day with um eating meals with uh with friends um yeah uh pretty focused day probably going to be the same for the next few day um as have exams tuesday wednesday and friday next week today started with fairly good night sleep um think got lot of uh hours of sleep in have been went to breakfast and then went uh right into studying again um for test exam on tuesday um i'm not i'm trying not to stress about the exam i'm not feeling stressed at all i'm thinking it is what it is i'm studying as much as can and uh that all can do um and yeah feel good about that um then after studying in the morning uh went to lunch and by myself and uh went to the gym just for the bike really quick and then tried to get back to studying and i've noticed after work out it takes me good while longer to finally get back into the school mode wasn't really motivated to study until uh my friend told me to and so buckled down and studied for little bit longer till dinner and then but was so was really productive before right before dinner uh feel like an hours or two before dinner and then kinda just chilled out uh hang out with and chatted with friend and who hadn't uh seen in little bit so we caught up tonight which was good and now going to bed gonna get up early and uh workout tomorrow morning today started with an okay night sleep uh got to bed at reasonable hour but woke up think at around 500 am and was up till at least 600 and then finally fell back asleep but my uh alarm was for think 715-ish so got up around then then uh went over to the field and played catch got my throwing in and then had good workout felt good uh felt that that was really promising then um got back ate big breakfast and uh and tried to crush an studying uh have exams the next two days and then one friday so was focused on tomorrow exams um it class that enjoy so uh studying wasn't too bad and um not too stressful at all so um yeah feeling fine about tomorrow uh all afternoon was studying but really couldn't wasn't as focused as would like to have been especially when came to studying for wednesday exams uh but in terms of studying for tomorrow exams got the work done that needed to and feel good um after dinner i've really got really nothing done kinda just chilled out and now i'm going to bed for tomorrow before tomorrow morning exams today was my first final exam and uh think it went well which is awesome uh slept okay last night and think woke up at like 500 and i'm not really sure if fell back asleep before my alarm at like 0715 or something like that so whatever my morning exam went well felt focused um felt like had energy no problem um that said after the exam did not have as much concentration or motivation to study for tomorrow 0600 am which will be significantly harder than today so i'm little bit nervous about that but um trying to go in confident and um so was studying in the afternoon and just felt the need to go work out like it was on my mind so went and lifted then went and had dinner with some teammates some older teammates who like um but um got good got to spend some time with them which was fun then came back to the dorm looked over my notes for few minutes then really just kind of chilled out with my roommate and now time for bed uh morning exam tomorrow today started with okay night sleep uh had to get up early for [inaudible] exam and um it was um hard hard exam but knew it was gonna be hard um so felt uh little nervous but not not as bad as thought would um would have been think that uh took lot of my took lot of the energy out of me and then ate lunch and then went over to the field and played catch and got little workout in and looking back just wish did more feel little dissatisfied in that um yeah then after uh came back and uh tried to study little bit for my next fi my last final which is friday um and got little studying done but not as productive as could've been and then after dinner really didn't get anything done but didn't expect to so um overall okay day um tomorrow well no exam just studying and working out today started with not great night sleep uh went to bed at decent hour and then uh was uh woke up at like 400 am uh to uh because of the people across the hall being uh pretty loud so was up from like 400 to 500 uh which wasn't ideal uh but didn't feel um the the lack of energy till later in the day so after breakfast got some good work done in studying for my test tomorrow my last final and uh excuse me and then went to lunch and then to the gym and had really uh good but really difficult um workout and that took the energy right out of me um after lift um initially felt like had more energy and then quickly um lost that energy uh in the afternoon so really no work got done in the afternoon which was was planning on doing some work so after dinner actually felt like had more energy had some had dinner with my friends um and had like good maybe productive hour after after dinner but um could've been more productive today studying for tomorrow test but um think am ready uh today also reached uh talked with few friends from home who hadn't talked to in while um just via text but it was good to catch up with them so that was awesome uh tomorrow my last day here last final then going home for break super excited about that today started with with an all right night sleep uh got up um had my last final today so got up had breakfast and then uh studied in uh the dining hall in [redacted] uh after ate breakfast and then uh had lunch and then had my exam after uh after lunch and uh didn't get um didn't really wanna study uh really really hard uh before the exam uh but was at table with an friends and we was uh answering an questions just kind of uh low-stress um think the exam went well and then got picked up cleaned up the dorm and uh drove home and it was awesome seeing my dad and mom and brother uh we went out to dinner and uh just had an awesome time catching up um really really glad to be home and i'm glad the first semester is uh is closed and uh went pretty well um going to bed now uh and my own bed feels amazing today started with an okay night sleep [not] not as good as had hoped for first night in my own bed but think woke up once in the middle of the night and then woke up before my alarm but uh no worries had breakfast then um went to the uh training facility the gym that uh work out at and uh had good lift then came back and had lunch and uh just did an things that had to get done then kinda just chilled out um then hung out with um hung out with my friends tonight who haven't seen since uh since thanksgiving uh just hung out for little bit and uh now time for bed very-low-stress day um really good today started with uh waking up little earlier than wanted to um but got up and really didn't have anything for today which was great um really low stress really low-key day most of my day just read had some books wanna read so uh made good dent in uh in two of them and then uh just kinda hung out with the family went for walk with my dad which was nice and really just laid low today was little tired in the afternoon so took nap from like 430 to 500 um but uh that probably because didn't sleep as long as could have this morning so hopefully gonna get good night sleep tonight today started with not great night sleep felt um little bit tired in the midday and not super motiv uh mean fairly motivated just the energy wasn't there and during the workout um uh think might've hurt myself uh just little and uh so that led to oh whole bunch of emotions of anger and dissatisfaction and yeah i'm pretty pretty angry at myself i'm not sure how serious it'll be or whatever but um yeah not too happy um spent all day trying to make it feel better and nothing really worked and uh hung out with some friends tonight which was good and then towards the end started thinking about it hurting and uh just kind of got pretty angry and left and then uh chatted with my dad and he helped me talk through it um more so just listening than talking but it was um it what needed today started with uh good night sleep probably my best night sleep in while um got think uh at least close to full eight hours straight which is which is unique for me unfortunately so hopefully gonna get good night sleep tonight um had good throwing and uh and workout today uh kinda consciously tried to be really positive um and it helped my mood and how felt physically and think the sleep helped um but yeah then uh got home and just kinda uh hung out uh and went to my brother uh singing uh concert little performance which was quick and uh really impressive uh so that was good um good to see him do what he do best um overall um better day today uh than yesterday uh hopefully good day tomorrow today started with an all right night sleep uh not not as great as wanted to but um to make up for it took short like power nap in the afternoon for at like 130 o'clock and it was um very beneficial um in the morning uh after eating spent lot of time stretching and making my body feel better uh and then uh rode the bike broke broke good sweat and uh felt better after that um after my brother got home from school we went to the store and he got um his christmas present spent an time with mom and the brother out at the uh out at the shopping mall whatever um all good and then uh this evening um the brother uh got an bad news about an test scores or whatever so we uh as family was there for him uh tried to be supportive and so that got me down seeing him be upset made me upset so just tried to be there for him um and like said be supportive and help him any way can uh hopefully get good night sleep tonight and uh have an more energy tomorrow today started with good night sleep think got at least almost full eight hours in which was great uh played and went to uh the um training facility with my friend from high school for baseball and we played catch and worked out um and the uh the back isn't really uh getting uh much better which is discouraging and it uh always on my mind and uh yeah i'm not too happy about it so

dinner then came back to the dorm and was just really physically tired called home chatted with home uh chatted with mom who doing well with dad who doing well and uh the uh just we just chatted and then had to the only little stressful part of the day is trying to reschedule some exam and uh figure out how i'm gonna get all my work done this week with baseball practice uh going to bed now today started with fine night sleep uh got up and went to breakfast and then had back-to-back classes from 900 to 1000 and then 1000 to 1100 then uh had classes from 1200 to 100 then went straight over to locker room and spent um don't know maybe almost an hour on working on homework um set um so today was just the only stress in the day was trying to figure out what was maximizing time and having to figure out when was going to get the uh set that had done and the reading that had done everything kind of due friday and uh have an exam tomorrow so just stuff like that had to had to work through and just uh basically any free time had to get something done school work-wise so uh overall fine day today started with an okay night sleep uh didn't have class but had uh test at 1100 am so the morning was spent doing an last uh minute preparing for that and that went well thought it was easy so after that grabbed lunch and then had an time that uh tried to be productive and get an work done but uh wasn't wasn't as productive as could have been but it uh all got done later um after lift and after practice which was both long and um you know got to the field around 200 and didn't leave till 700 so um lot of time spent there but after went to office hours and got an work work done so had to be pretty efficient with my time today and uh now i'm going to sleep today started with not so great night sleep uh woke up around 530 and couldn't really fall back asleep so uh regardless made that sleep up feel like in the afternoon uh did like guided laying-down meditation just chilled out for at least don't know half an hour 45 minutes so that kind of recharged the batteries but felt uh really uh really good today overall in terms of getting homework done um classes went fine and then uh practice felt um i'd say healthier than normal in terms of back pain so all positives um started to lose um focus towards um probably like the second half of practice so that was just something noticed in when got back to the dorm after 10 o'clock just i'm feeling very tired uh physically uh so hopefully get good night sleep tonight and right back at it again tomorrow with uh 1000 am 1000 am lift today started with uh pretty good night sleep think uh got up and went to have breakfast then to uh baseball where we had uh workout and then right into practice um felt uh fine in the workout

due friday and paper due saturday but have to uh leave for trip so need to plan out i'm not stressing yet but we'll we'll see how it goes today started getting up little later than usual just to compensate and make up for the previous night lack of sleep uh yeah think the extra sleep helped me today uh energy-wise that for sure uh most of my day was studying for an exam that went fairly well this evening uh just because hadn't studied enough over the baseball weekend um other than that had pretty good practice and found out would be traveling again this weekend to new mexico so that will be interesting but this week is jam-packed with work because i'll be going away so going to have to manage my time pretty well and be efficient when have when have time uh overall didn't feel as nervous pitching today um and felt not as excited as um would have expected to be traveling but it it all good today started with an all-right night sleep uh had fairly busy day with uh jam-packed going from class to class uh to lunch to class then right over to the field uh didn't have as long time to stretch and do physical therapy then had to lift um and then right into practice so kind of back to back to back and then uh had dinner with professor with few other classmates and that was really good to uh get to know him more and just have an informal uh meeting with him and uh then after that had to grind on homework because i'll be away this weekend so have to get work done early so uh it was good to uh get the work lot of it done but uh with that said going to bed little later than i'd like to right now today started with not-a-great night sleep went to bed little later than wanted to because had to get some work done uh got up breakfast at 900 and then uh had to uh get worksheet and then headed straight to the field around uh before lunchtime like around 1130 then had to um uh play get my throwing and my physical therapy work done and then uh went and got one and then big travel day for us we uh went from [redacted] to uh to [redacted] to [redacted] and then bus to uh [redacted] so big travel day but had to get lot of uh work done so felt fairly productive in that time today was long day at the ball field uh forgot to do uh my uh survey yesterday but pretty much the same day as today long day um filled with baseball and uh spent lot of time out in the sun which is little tiring and uh didn't get to play yesterday or today hopefully i'll play tomorrow but uh moreso just happy to be with the team and uh with with my friends uh watching baseball in the nice weather very nice uh down here in new mexico so uh other than that uh just uh pretty actually had to submit final uh draft of paper which was little stressful this morning but got that done no problem today started with not lot of sleep got off of uh red-eye this morning early at like 530 uh and maybe got four hours of sleep on the plane so not very good sleep then got back to uh the locker room and uh had some time before breakfast and my first class and didn't have time to take nap so just actually worked out felt like it gave me energy through my first class and my second class really hit wall but uh then had um lunch which gave me some more energy to get through my noon class then took nap from 100 to 300 uh and had some energy for uh the rest of the day which was good um then had to do um some econ and math homework uh all this evening now going to bed today started by getting up little later than usual uh but think just had to catch up on sleep that missed the night before uh then went to breakfast with some friends and uh then got little bit just little bit of work done before my first class at 1100 and then uh went from class to lunch with some more friends and uh then after that uh got little bit more work done before practice and then uh before practice or the workout and then practice had uh chat with my coaches uh just haven't been doing great so had to uh chat with them and think uh just need to make some changes going forward so um baseball-wise so that been on my mind kind of been uh thinking about little uh nervous and anxious about that things but it is what it is after practice uh got dinner with some friends finished up homework and now going to sleep today started with pretty good night sleep today was housing day which was um exciting and uh little nerve-racking at the same time not sure in what house would get so in the morning went over to my buddy and block mate uh dorm and we found out we got [redacted] which we're all happy about um so that was good start to the day then uh went to lunch with bunch of friends and then uh went down to the field to work out and play catch which went well then currently in south carolina we took flight down this this evening and uh things was delayed and we got back really late so getting to bed little later than want to and have to wake up early which is not ideal at all but it'll be all right today was long day at baseball uh we all got into the hotel very late or fairly late last night and had to get up for early morning breakfast and uh so everybody was kind of running on uh little sleep but uh didn't feel too tired until after the games didn't play any of the games which is fine and we got the two wins which was exciting fun and but uh just uh still trying to get my confidence back in my pitching which is just always on my mind and i'm probably overthinking it so uh but all in all uh good day of baseball with uh two out of two wins and went to uh dinner with uh some of my friends on the team and now going to bed trying to catch up on sleep today was good day long day full of uh full of baseball we uh had to get up early for breakfast again and uh headed over to the field and played doubleheader so two games back-to-back so uh pretty tiring even though when didn't play it uh on your feet all day and just always having to be ready to play so uh but exciting wins so pretty positive happy exciting day then uh got back to the hotel and went out uh to dinner with some teammates to really good uh diner spot so all in all good day today started uh getting up for breakfast felt little tired this morning then had well actually in between breakfast and lunch got little bit of work done then went out to lunch with uh some teammates and then uh watched the harvard uh playoff basketball game on tv and after that went for good workout uh down here in south carolina to gym as team uh after that uh played catch with teammates and just didn't do very well not feeling really good baseball-wise and kinda just have to figure lot of things out kinda had mental breakdown had to call home and just they really helped me out today mom and dad uh just things aren't going as well as would like so uh after that went out to good dinner uh with some teammates got back and chatted with my mom for while and now i'm going to sleep today was good day started out uh with uh breakfast before 900 and then um pretty uh low-key day off day for games so we just had practice at local college and uh that was just really low-key then after got some work done in the afternoon and my good friend from uh [redacted] came at uh little before dinner time and drove me back to [redacted] he took me around campus showed me around uh the area and then we grabbed dinner and so he friend from high school and uh one of my closest friend so it was really nice to see him and uh spend time and just hang out you know uh so all-in-all pretty good day today was long day started uh had to get up for breakfast um before o'clock and then um got to uh had to workout little in the hotel gym uh it felt good to work out um after that showered up and got on the bus for uh game this afternoon at [redacted] which was super exciting um big-time stadium pretty uh pretty cool experience um so it was good day spending time with the team we didn't uh do particularly well didn't play um but the experience was cool and then the last uh after the game long bus ride home uh chatted with the bro-brother and dad and uh went out to dinner with some dad and the teammates and now going to bed today was another long day um started with breakfast early in the morning and uh think it was long day especially because went to bed um later than would have liked last night um but regardless um

of downtime before uh getting on the bus going to doubleheader game uh we won one lost one pretty exciting game uh fun to be with the team didn't play but um situation didn't really call for it so uh

didn't get into the game unfortunately but um uh no worries got my work in afterwards then uh worked out little and uh had an awesome dinner with just one teammate and it was uh really nice um after that came back to the room uh watched movie with uh an teammate and hopefully going to bed soon today was long day that started early in the morning had to get breakfast catch the bus for the airport um did lot of reading in the airport which was nice just time to myself and even on the plane got uh finished book so good time to myself even though was sitting between two teammates um got back and

1100 and then did little uh homework and then lunch and then class again then did lot of homework between my uh in the afternoon then had class 300 to 500 then quick dinner um so just like very rushed day every meal was quick and had breakfast and dinner alone and just scarfed down some food and after dinner went to uh across the river and uh actually threw by myself which was kinda nice just to kinda cathartic being by myself so that was nice um physically felt all right not as good as would have hoped but all good uh and then after that went had make-up class at 730 then after that did some reading for [redacted] so very full day um but yeah very full very rushed day but uh all in all pretty happy getting to bed right now good time today was uh fairly long day but felt like it was good day um woke up and had had breakfast got little bit of work done and then actually went to uh sports psychologist to um just discuss how things have been going the past few months it been tough time coming back from injury so spent time uh with him uh and uh my mom after which felt um the appointment was productive and it was awesome to see my mom who uh who haven't seen in while so got lunch with her then was planning on going to class but practice just moved so um the last minute which was uh just little uh not stressful at all but uh guess didn't see it coming so had to adapt and uh change the plans then had dinner and tried to be productive after dinner with my essay but just wasn't uh productive at all so that was unfortunate um going to bed now today was uh pretty jam packed busy day uh with lot of work um had class from very low key class from 900 to 1000 and then 1000 to 1100 um then little bit of break for lunch then had pretty chill class lecture then really started to work hard on my paper which rough draft due sunday so spent time doing that but went to the writing lab worked on it some more before dinner with some teammates so um then went to um practice which was um productive not everything didn't go as well as wanted but um nonetheless after that uh quickly went got to ec office hours um which helped and then did finish the work with friend and now hopefully going to sleep today was normal day um only one class today but um i'm meeting in the afternoon with teacher so um the majority of my morning and afternoon was spent um by myself uh doing homework and working on paper um but um had both all had all my meals with um teammates um which was nice but noticed the time was by myself was more productive than usual think just uh got rid of the distractions um went to quiet uh places and really locked in so um felt good there then practice went well um through well had good productive practice um chatted with mom on the phone just to catch up which was um nice even though saw her just few day ago and uh then had dinner with some teammates finished up um econ again felt pretty productive and now going to sleep looking forward to tomorrow hopefully seeing some high school friends for dinner today started with not getting great night sleep woke up about 500 or 600 um in the morning and had trouble falling back asleep till my alarm was set at uh 800 am after that uh had classes that uh went pretty well at uh 1000 to 1100 and then 1200 to 100 but um after that uh didn't have any time to get work done went straight over to the field had quick uh pretty easy low-stress practice which was really nice and then uh worked out and then came to my uh friend school and bunch of friend from high school came over and we was just hanging out and uh that why i'm going to sleep later than usual right now had lot of fun with my friend from high school though today was overall uh good day definitely didn't get as much sleep as wanted last night so hopefully will catch up on sleep tonight but uh felt very uh productive in the time spent doing work um by myself um in the morning and then after practice um which was after dinner or practice was in the afternoon work after dinner so uh felt like was productive um had uh good uh dinner with uh some teammates with some friends and uh then got to work um chatted with my mom and dad on the phone which was nice to catch up with them uh around dinner time and now going to sleep today was another day where felt uh fairly efficient with my time uh especially uh doing uh doing schoolwork um in the morning before uh had to head to the field which was around lunchtime got finished an essay which was good uh and then spent while down at the field um had really good practice actually performed well uh which was great then uh was feeling good went to uh work out long long workout but it was necessary felt good uh afterwards um had big dinner with um an friends and then uh went to the library and got the rest of my work done for tomorrow uh before dinner chatted with my parents just gave them the update on practice and everything and uh all is well then chatted with my little brother for um little bit which was nice as well today was um fairly good day full of full of class but um felt um engaged and uh uh present in the class and again felt um fairly uh productive with my time uh especially before dinner time then uh after dinner time went across uh to the field played catch uh uh went running for little and uh and then showered and came back over and did laundry and uh got some food but wanted to get some work done or just um textbook reading uh done during after dinner but uh couldn't get that done so that was little unfortunate uh then also have to uh find partner for project and uh can't find one so that um little annoying but other than that all good today started uh started out well got up did little uh mindfulness meditation started the day well uh got breakfast with um somebody who like new friend and um baseball teammate um and then started doing some homework uh only to realize was uh late for some appointment with my uh sport psychologist so um most of that meeting today was on the phone and then the last part was in person once got there but um regardless of that uh was as just upset with myself about that but uh got over it and had good session with him uh connected obviously connected with him but more so just uh taking lessons from the week prior and um making sure to continue that got to spend time with my mom after that um who drove me back to campus uh then got some work done before practice uh and then after practice uh got dinner uh with just one teammate who don't spend ton of time with which was nice then went to some entryway meeting so met with my proctor and path and some person in the entryway so it was good um wanted to get some work done after dinner but didn't kinda got sidetracked in some um youtube videos and then the entryway meeting and so uh but all in all uh not bad day today started out waking up little earlier than normal um intending to get some work done before my 900 am class but uh unfortunately that did not happen instead just chilled into my 900 am class um which went well same thing with the 1000 am and then uh intended to get some work done before lunch it didn't really happen not really motivated um and think that was just because was excited for um my game this afternoon this evening so um we had to leave by o'clock um for o'clock game and then that was long game but it was good we played really well pitched well um got to see my dad after the game so um it was really good time so um even though sacrificed some schoolwork or whatever no biggie i'll catch up tomorrow and uh it well worth uh good baseball and seeing my dad and then uh got some food after the game with so-some teammates overall today was felt um pretty tired both uh just energy-wise and especially physically tired um not sure if that from sleep or from lot of exercise or what um maybe game yesterday getting in late um however um uh got up got some homework done before my 11 o'clock class so felt productive then got um lunch but noticed even though got breakfast at 900 and lunch at 1230 um just still felt full from breakfast and didn't really wanna eat lunch and so uh my appetite was down today for sure and even um into the afternoon where usually have like big snack didn't really feel as hungry so that was something that was out of the ordinary um then this evening uh so felt tired and achy all practice and that uh team lift and then uh but got dinner with friend which was good at restaurant and then uh got uh finished reading assignment reading textbook uh then chatted with my dad after that and uh let him know not uh traveling this weekend for baseball didn't make the travel roster so um mixed emotions there um hopefully gonna get good night sleep now uh and feel better tomorrow today was pretty uneventful day overall uh only had uh two classes today so um woke up uh got breakfast and got little bit of work done before my my 1000 am and then got some work done in between my 1000 and noon classes and uh the noon classes was super interesting felt pretty focused and engaged and same thing in the other classes then uh got lunch and headed over to the field um just me and uh one other teammate uh got in my work that we needed to get in uh we did it pretty leisurely and then just rode the bike for um little and uh then came back chatted on the phone with my mom and particularly with my dad for while which was nice uh got dinner and then hang out with friend until uh until now so very low-key day uh but ready for bed today was good day fairly lowkey day uh got up uh before wanted to so actually was able to fall back asleep uh this morning get my uh full hours in for sleep last night and felt like that helped me today felt um productive in the morning got some work done then headed over to the field uh practiced with the players who didn't uh travel this weekend and then got really good workout in then finished up homework in the locker room while watching baseball uh then chatted with the folks for while and uh after that uh went out to dinner just by myself lot of people are away for uh eso easter and passover so um but got really good dinner and then hung out with one friend who was here and we just uh hung out for the night now going to sleep today was good day overall it started out with not-the-best night sleep think the the sun rising is waking me up in my room but regardless uh had little took while to fall back asleep but um ended up getting up uh doing little uh mindfulness to start the day theni saw my brother and parents for brunch uh this morning and then we walked around [redacted] um [redacted] for um good while just chatting catching up and uh spending family time which was awesome awesome awesome so after that uh tried to get um some studying done for some exam later in the week and then uh really wanted to work out so um went across over worked out had good dinner with two teammates and then uh continued studying after dinner um at the library not as productive as would've liked but um nonetheless uh got some done so going to bed now today was jam-packed day started with good night sleep and uh got up before my alarm and got good breakfast with friend and then uh had lot of class and then meetings with or one meetings with teacher and basically any free time had that wasn't eating was doing homework um this weeks is pretty pretty busy with uh schoolwork and baseball uh and it all combined just adds to uh little bit of stressful weeks so tried to get ahead this today um not sure um think just did as well as could so uh with that uh baseball game tomorrow so trying to get good night sleep tonight today was pretty uh jam packed eventful day uh got up had nice breakfast with friend and then uh had to go um to my sports psychologist we had good meeting things are definitely getting better uh did little mindfulness in the morning mindfulness during the uh the session just to relax and focus on the breath and uh after that uh came back and had to get on bus uh for game that eventually got canceled due to rain uh so that was frustrating for everybody involved um then we get back and coach says we have workout which was also frustrating just didn't plan it so um in all that dead time got some work done uh and especially after dinner got lot of work done uh little later than wanted to but going to sleep now today was good day definitely long day um started with uh 900 am class um didn't think got um ton of sleep the night before but um or not not lot but not as much as would have liked um after morning class um had uh class at noon then headed right down to the field tried to study for an exam but um and did study but don't feel uh like i've been getting much better at it for math exam tomorrow so don't feel completely prepared after uh that got on the bus and uh we had very exciting game we won an extra earnings um tonight so that was super fun uh spending time with the guys um just lot of high energy and uh good time so that where go getting back late now and going to sleep soon today was another long day um didn't get an amazing night sleep but thought it was fine uh woke up and had uh good breakfast then uh studied took practice test before my 11 am class uh went over that test during class studied an more uh for the exam that was tonight um so that was on my mind all day um thought it would um after lunch we had practice at one and uh it was like bad communication between the coaches and players and so um people was was little uh irritable but um all in all it worked out we rearranged the workout after and felt like had really good practice so that uh uh called my dad filled him in and then uh had dinner or before dinner uh got an homework done dinner then took the exam then finished up homework uh with an friends now going to sleep today was good day felt like was uh fairly productive in the time in the free time had which was quite bit today so that was uh that was really good uh the next few day have baseball games so don't see whole lot of work getting done so pretty much got most of the work out of the way uh tonight and this afternoon which was uh awesome uh had quick little practice uh actually during the snow um but um other than that uh pretty much working day uh by myself um and you know what it was uh not problem knew needed to get it done so uh got it done today was long day started woke up little bit earlier than wanted to um but which was so ended up waking up at 600 had to be to the field at uh 715 for long day of baseball which was fun the team did really well and uh it was just uh high energy and good time unfortunately didn't play which was um uh it is what it is um would've loved to play but understand um the situation doesn't make sense or whatever so after the game went to dinner with my dad which was really nice and uh and then had to uh work or just do long reading uh for class on monday um so tried uh or got that done so felt uh productive even though didn't really wanna do it today was an all-right day started uh getting up little earlier than wanted to um which seems to be trend i'm waking up before my alarm can't sleep as long as want to um but regardless got up and uh got breakfast and went down to the field we had another game today um and well it was fun for uh most of it unfortunately we lost um so was little up and down uh with the team but um nonetheless uh got to chat with my dad after the game which was really good um unfortunately didn't uh get to play again the situation didn't really call for it but um so that little um upsetting but out of my control so uh then went to dinner and hung out with an friend with the teammates in the locker room and then went to dinner then had to get work done uh this evening but as was walking just felt little oh don't know like overwhelmed or um just needed to take breath um and that what did just sat outside and just did an mindfulness focused on the breath and just relaxed and then uh finished up the schoolwork needed to and then got to uh hang out in the room by myself uh um this evening today was very jam-packed long day um starting with class at 900 class at 1000 then doing homework till noon then going to class uh then uh to lunch and continuing finishing that homework um and then to class from 300 to 500 um and then working on project till dinner at 600 then got to uh didn't do any work after dinner went to the field played catch and uh and then did laundry which is why i'm going to bed so late but um for me anyway but throughout the day chatted with my dad um just about um how things is going uh baseball-wise little frustrated um so it was good to just uh talk with him and then chatted with him and my mom uh this evening and uh for like well over an hour and it was really supportive um and just um giving their best advice uh which was always um [which is] always good uh with that said that was the um only uh stressor really um maybe the work little compounded with it but uh hopefully gonna get good night sleep tonight today today started um with an all right night sleep uh got um got up went to breakfast and then uh went to my sports psychologist chatted through the past week and um gave me an tips uh going forward um just um little frustrated with the whole um baseball situation and um just uh worked through that so that was positive then chatted with mom and dad on the phone uh after that which was positive um then uh went to class um which was good uh and had really nice lunch with an friends uh then uh wanted to get an work done before practice or should've but didn't and uh then had good practice um good lift and then dinner uh out with an friends and then watched the red sox and finished up my homework um was chatting with friends in group text um friends from home talking about the summer and just uh really excited about that so that sidetracked me along with the baseball game so not super super focused but got everything needed to get done so uh going to bed now um game that was supposed to be played today got postponed till tomorrow so that was another uh change of plans so going to bed now hopefully get good night sleep today was long day started out with class at 900 then uh class at 1000 uh got uh quick or just normal lunch and then went to part of class at noon and then had to go down to the field uh to get on the bus for our afternoon game which um we won which was really exciting uh but didn't play which was fine just um continually frustrated with the lack of communication um on the team so uh on the one hand i'm excited for the team on the other hand am uh just little frustrated with myself and the coaches and um our progress so that always on our mind um got to see our dad at the game and talked to mom and dad on the phone after and they helped me think through some things and team went out to celebrate after the game but wasn't up for they so worked out after the game and just came to the dorm and did some work while everybody else was out so i'm not feeling that outgoing this evening and going to bed now today was tough day um more from baseball perspective uh that definitely was the stress of today um didn't um perform well in practice today um especially be and think it due to having um exerted myself overdoing it yesterday um but the frustration comes from the lack of communication as to what we'll be doing every practice and that in turn changes how prepare so that lot of frustration with the uh coaches unfortunately and uh yeah that that was definitely the big um that caused me to be get really down on myself and um stressed out and mad so called the folks at home talked talked me through it uh which was really nice and uh that delayed me getting my homework done till late tonight so going to bed later than would've liked but had to get something in by midnight so going to bed now today started off to slow start didn't sleep as late as wanted to which was kinda laid in bed not really feeling like getting up and starting the day eventually got down to breakfast and uh then to class and then was actually productive in between class going to the library and then um at noon went to class then um spent good time just stretching just felt very physically sore today um from

fantastic it am wonderful and nice and funny and kind and don't know they're blessings beyond my imagination so came back to my dorm later that night um was really hungry so we went to go get [redacted] it was nice restaurant um we bought an chips was still little bit hungry and mainly just wanted an grub kind of to you know an junk food to get me away from the whole feeling little bit disconnected and stuff called my family today it was nice um it was nice just to hear their voice and hear their plans and stuff and hearing how it plans on living their life and it was nice um and they're sending my computer up which i'm super super super excited for it has my video games it has my theater pieces it has lot of my work and it just makes me happy to know that it coming up here so that really what i'm looking forward to all right well thank you phone for recording me good night goodbye it has been great day um went to church early in the morning realized need to reestablish some of my priorities uh reestablish my life kind of in way really need to guess kinda get my life in order not necessarily like completely and to the tee but just has that sense of diligently seeking what is right and uh was pretty happy about that um today uh was kind of annoyed because the church is uh 53-minute ride think and it it was nice church not really one that will probably go to um consecutively i'll probably go to different church uh it it was great and all but it just wasn't for me i'm looking for something maybe little bit different that being said had good time it was nice to be in church setting again called my friend really missed him haven't talked to him in really long time so hearing him and me kind of like giving out spiel on how i've been feeling recently about uh you know feeling extremely happy but also to some extent lonely simply because uh i'm in new environment i'm in place that haven't been to you know i'm experiencing new things new emotions and it just feels different and for me consider myself as strong individual that is able to overcome anything but it still was extremely different to be in that situation of just newness so uh know last night was kind of little bit down kind of really really really tired went to i've been sleeping little bit less uh and whenever throughout the day feels fine like feels great feels compelled to do things and i'm ready to do work and everything else but once it get to nighttime get extremely tired um so i'm gonna see if can kind of fix that up bit try not going to sleep so late know one of these night these week went to sleep like around 500 and uh that was really late we was watching movie um so tonight i've just been doing homework i've been doing lot of homework today lot of reading been very productive it nice to see that uh i'm doing great i'm very happy love these college love my room love it all and genuinely am doing good and it nice to know that it feels like has place here feels like belong know that belong and though at time it might not feels that way know that do so that my audio log for today am currently doing laundry and i'm gonna get back to doing homework night so today was very interesting day because today went to class uh enjoyed my class enjoyed math so that was an awesome thing afterwards came to my room read for bit just relaxed and then went to lunch actually right before went to lunch my friend came in who is almost like my third unofficial roommate and brought in water jug which we have been looking for for so long and him bringing it in we fold it up we installed it and it felt so awesome we was so excited it so nice to have water in my room it the little thing that love uh went to go get lunch after lunch helped my friend take printer to her dorm and then went back to my dorm and chilled for bit and read for bit and then my friend asked me to help her and her roommate move couch up to her floor and so helped him do that um and maybe it southern hospitality but enjoy helping other people out and it was really nice to see her expressions of just like in awe that somebody helped him carry couch so far from the mail room to her dorm up up an stairs and help him install it um we had lot of laughs and it was just nice to connect with people like that it offered to buy me food asked for red bull and it said that thing will kill you [laughter] so we'll get you something else which think was really sweet of him and kind of unnecessary didn't did it because wanted to not because you know was looking for kind of reward but it was nice and it it have an funny photos which have now of me carrying it and installing it so it was pretty great uh after that we had meeting with my entryway it was uh something that feel like we should have had during pre-orientation so was kind of distracted throughout but was still you know trying to be engaged trying to be interactive because know that it was an important issue uh afterwards did an homework did an reading uh ate an orange which was really good it was really good orange it didn't have seeds and that was awesome because seeds is very pestering especially whenever you take big bite into an orange slice and you find seeds in the middle it just kind of disappointing you know 'cause then you gotta take time to like spit out the seeds and you know all that stuff um like mentioned and guess that my theme for this audio log is th love the little thing absolutely do they're great they're wonderful and think people forget how awesome it is all right cool night so today was interesting today was really busy you like like all my tuesdays all my tuesdays are very busy they're they're very like back to back to back to back to back and um normally that not problem after class ate with some friends had good time just got to chill and relax around 420 got text that close family friends had passed away today and it doesn't feel real it feel like joke uh uh or not really joke but it feel fake it feel surreal like it guess it because i'm not home and this are one of the very few time that i've actually called my hometown home since i've been here at college after hearing that and after calling my mom to make sure that it was true and stuff to really hear the voice went outside and took walk didn't cry wasn't super down remember just stood in front of the yard and just stayed for bit had cup of tea with me or or mug and just walked just kept walking and would just make random turns just kept walking there wasn't much that was on my mind though just kept walking kept spilling some tea and it didn't really bug me uh just kept walking haven't really told anybody um didn't feel like there was need to doesn't know i'm just kind of the kind of person that if have problem usually like to keep it to myself not necessarily because find it as sign of weakness but just because uh it how like to be so ate dinner with friends had good time you know was laughing and joking and but it felt like was step behind went back did some homework and uh hung out with my friends uh girl that i'm interested in doesn't think she interested in me but that okay so we ate popcorn and watched game of thrones and it was nice little thing it was nice little experience just to like you know sit down with good friends and just chill it was nice it was kind of like nice little turning off the brain and now i'm about to go do some more homework maybe go get like midnight snack later on uh but that my plans for tonight it really just to do homework and do some reading and get ahead in class i'm overall still really happy even though you know there was death of loved one but you know what can you do it'll be alright thing will always be alright believe that so today had class early in the morning um or not really early it was around 1000 uh it was solid class had left when got to meet some new people um which was nice click during the surveys whenever it says how many people have interacted with face to face don't know if it means average to every people or average to myself so i've been doing uh average to myself uh if it is average to myself i'm more of sociable people so do meet lot of people throughout the day um hung out with my roommates hung out with some friends um and it was it was nice you know it was really chill it nice whenever i'm hanging out with my friends especially feel like part of my brain just slips away like as if you know lot of my stress just kinda goes away and i'm not normally stressful people 'cause see the stress and think to myself everything gonna be fine and so just don't dwell on it so normally don't feel stressed uh pretty much at all uh today had rehearsal which was nice got to interact with some new people um the number of people was just about the same the people was different like people that interacted with and it was all super um inclusive it was all you know came into this rehearsal and it was my first rehearsal group and it was very willing to bring me in and it was nice and had good fun time with them uh you know we laughed we had some jokes and stuff i'm looking forward to class tomorrow actually really am um did my reading for my class which normally don't do majority of it because it over things that have already read so don't worry too much but today was like i'm gonna read at least 90 of the reading for tomorrow and that exactly what did tomorrow on my way to class or in my free time in the morning before my class i'm going to finish the rest of it um just to be little bit more prepared um 'cause do enjoy my religion class and that what the reading is all for also have acting class of comedy had already presented so you know it really big relief whenever you don't have to present anymore 'cause remember whenever did have to present now forgot to mention this in my other audio log but was was kinda nervous remember feeling my heartbeat inside but you know it was pretty chill time you know still was all right and so i'm excited uh uh i'm excited for tomorrow it gonna be chill day i'm gonna get lot of work after class done also uh didn't realize it was wednesday until tonight like was on the phone with my mom it was them birthday today and so told them happy birthday and called them in the morning and also called them at night and sent them text throughout the day so it was nice um but it feel weird because wednesday is normally church day for me so it feel kind of less busy to some extent which is fine but kinda miss you know church on wednesday anyway that my day that my thoughts that is my emotions uh night today was fun day today ate breakfast with uh some of my friends from the pre-orientation program after that went to two classes felt really interactive during that classes um especially my second one didn't talk as much during the discussion but just felt more interactive think it because did more of the reading that felt more kind of involved and and enjoyed that like was able to give things more of my attention notes just came easier and guess just coming in with the mindset of did my work i'm prepared feel good you know and so it gave me that like confidence as went in after that ate lunch with my roommates which was nice we had good time we laughed um ate little bit more sweets throughout the day than would have liked after lunch took nap here in my dorm and then went to one of the labs and sat down on computer and said i'm gonna do as much work as can went through quite bit of work did uh some emails and stuff was pretty productive and it felt good uh but felt like it took me longer than would have liked um and once got done like around 600 me and my roommates we went and we went to go eat lunch or go eat dinner after that had rehearsal uh and about me eating felt good eating with them have been eating kind of healthy eat salads and one other entree but i've been eating little bit more than some entree and so need to watch that and i'm kinda cautious about that 'cause i'm starting to feel like uh more self-conscious about my weight uh but it also makes me excited because um if can get into this rhythm of this diet of one salads one small salads and one entree it will be discipline then i'll feel good in my life so i'm excited about that um had rehearsal today for one of my plays wasn't needed as much as some of the other uh but still got to have fun with them and felt little bit don't wanna say disconnected but slightly out of place might be the word because i'm i'm the only nonmusical part in the plays and so all need to do is just speak in rhythm and so came for about some hour more or less to rehearsal and though that was fun and got to interact with the cast little bit more there is some members of the cast that simply do not know uh more than their names and so because of that i'm looking forward to getting to know them more uh we're gonna have little get-together on saturday and so that something that i'm super super super hyped for uh just spending time with the cast getting to know them interacting with them really like interacting with people uh that being said had study break at with my entryway and afterwards hung out with some of the people from my entryway and it was really cool um we talked about lot of stuff and we got onto personal level at some moments and we laughed and it was nice it really was nice and look forward to doing that again hopefully sometime soon today was fun um went to class uh afterwards hung out in my dorm for bit took pretty sweet nap it was pretty great uh hung out with my roommate and good friend of mine and we hung out here for bit uh eventually went and bought cards against humanity uh pretty fun board game so i'm really excited to eventually play that uh we hung out here for bit and then went to rehearsal where had lot of fun got to hang out with the cast for bit wasn't needed for long but it was long enough um afterwards went to show went to go see reversal with some people in my freshman seminar and it was huge amount of fun it was such cool show uh really enjoyed it really enjoyed uh the performance and we really had good time um it was just nice to be in each other company some of them went to go party at uh frat party which uh didn't really wanna go to because getting back would be hassle and partying in place where wasn't used to don't know it made me tiny bit like kind of nervous not really like nervous but just like cautious and so was like nah i'm not gonna go lot of people have the same idea so we came back and we ate some fancy waffles and it was nice just to like sit down and eat and we talked about my love of food together it was good time so right now it pretty late i'm getting pretty tired i'm gonna brush my teeth i'm just gonna watch netflix until go to sleep pretty excited about that um think that about it hmm talked lot less today wonder if talking to myself or talking to the phone like feel like it would help you out like feel like it de-stresses 'cause enjoy it like look forward to talking to this every day and don't know why maybe it 'cause don't talk about my day with people it just not in me like i'm i'm not used to it but talking to machine i'm down for [laughter] don't know enjoy this mean it fun well i'm gonna watch netflix bye so today was an interesting day 'cause today was lot of regret today was lot of just throughout the day feeling regretful and kind of shame of how last night went because last night made lot of regretful decisions um which at the time didn't think much of it until this morning and until um kind of at the end of last night uh but had an awesome friends that took care of me and cannot be more thankful to be blessed by them because it really are great um though are very embarrassed and kind of ashamed of what did and thinking to myself how could let this happen but learned from my mistakes and learned what to do what not to do how to handle situations um granted it came at cost but learned so there the bright side there good takeaway today was nice went to rehearsal and think are developing connection with me and one of the cast members she great she really funny really sweet really smart and um don't know didn't didn't think much of it at the time noticed that there was kind of connection but was like yeah you know whatever maybe it-it-it no big deal maybe it just in my head but you know later on was outside and we was hanging out for bit and we exchanged an information and it was nice um today has been lot of just recovery and doing work and trying to catch up and just stuff like that which stayed up late tonight it are past 330 and i'm gonna sleep now but

won't say productive but also not productive um after my class today hung around in my dorm for bit uh just chilled listening to music and then went to go eat uh after eating went to go take my math test where it was it was it was lot easier than expected it to be should have studied uh more because some of the questions really did go over my head and it wasn't towards until towards the end it came back to me but i'm still fairly confident in how did and believe that did well after that had somebody come over uh for one of my plays it picked out some costume item from me um really enjoyed it enjoyed uh had no idea who this person was so it was little bit kind of awkward uncomfortable 'cause was getting used to their presence but it was really nice really kind and so enjoyed just uh them pouring out clothing and then talking to me about my character so it was nice to just have that interaction really like interacting with person lot and uh don't know how many person who average we talk to but feel like mine is usually more than average so my average is more than the average um uh my roommate for this hung out with some friends during dinner ate with them it was really nice time really chill uh which is something enjoy really like that like kind more intimate moments with some friends um or just chill and not anything grand just that everyday moments that tiny dots on timeline that person often take for granted really enjoy that moments um left them little bit early 'cause uh had some reading to do and knew that it the longer stayed in the dining hall the more was

talked to some of my friends in the class afterwards during my religion class that was my discussions thing talked little bit more um was stunned by the girl that sat next to me uh she was really beautiful um and really kind and really sweet this will come into play because throughout the entire day like it was it just me looking at people in relationships which kind of got me thinking like

rounds of rehearsals pretty chill pretty relaxing uh nothing too hard nothing too like struggling it was pretty chill enjoyed it um messed up little bit in both and felt kinda bad but didn't let it

pastor um today and that was nice that was really nice actually came to catch up with them and just talk for bit it was good hearing them didn't really hang out with lot of people today to an extent i'm kinda glad just to have chill day to another extent don't like not doing much don't like chilling don't like vacation day don't like day off like to be doing things constantly with people or by myself and constantly be busy it just how am but don't know i'm really tired think think i'm gonna get good night sleep tonight i'm excited for tomorrow i'm excited to to do rehearsals to work and to hang out with friends so good night today was fun day think my day started off really chill really great by the fact that woke up at 940 and stayed in bed from 940 to 1140 just watching netflix and it was such relaxing nice time to just breathe and laugh and have good time just rolling in my bed love rolling in my bed love just moving my legs inside and feeling the softness of the sheets the softness of my pants it great it is one of the most underrated feeling ever um then had rehearsal had rehearsal for my musical had lot of fun think we did lotta we made lotta progress in my opinion um especially musically which is important to me because i'm not musically inclined so was kinda nervous about that but kind of just like whatever happens happens like there wasn't enough to to change my mind or to change my direction of my acting etc and stuff was kinda nervous of my pronunciation was just little bit overwhelmed immediately after that went to another rehearsal where it had hot chocolate and snacks and um all that jazz so it was pretty great it was nice we was just it was really chilled rehearsal just [line] through um the reason why bring up the snacks is because had not eaten anything up to this point it was really just chilled day and so drank some hot chocolate and it was so fantastic and you know i've never really had amazing hot chocolate every hot chocolate that i've had was just like oh this nice um not to discredit like the people that made me hot chocolate or my mom but it was just like oh this is nice had this hot chocolate from dunkin' donuts and it made me so happy don't know why it it was something very small but was so happy that you know my director had bought some entire big case of it and it uh it just made me happy to know that it cared for me because [laughter] i'm i'm really sucker for small gestures really am enjoy that small gestures of sh kindness the small smile on the street you know hello how is you doing all of that maybe it because i'm used to having that small gestures of sh kindness for myself but don't know so uh seeing all of that don't know it just made me excited for the day hyped um 'cause it out of their pocket if i'm right and it you know didn't pay dime for it and it it just made me happy that it was looking to give me as much as it could after that chilled relaxed ate dinner with some friends had really good time after that and after chilling some more and think might have taken nap um went and hung out with some friends tonight and we got lit as it say not too much though i'm feeling great know tomorrow i'm gonna wake up feeling pretty good so there that all right night it really late sleep tight today was interesting was an interesting day uh it was extremely long extremely exhausting um so started off by waking up kinda late kinda late-ish and going to our [load in] for our show where we set up the set and we built things and you know was productive and it great and enjoyed it enjoyed our time with the cast and that was not problem at all had lot of fun building and carrying things and painting but um was definitely pretty worn by the end of it so that was around noon enjoyed our entire time there like had lot of fun doing it had lot of fun just interacting with the cast and breathing and you know just manual labor is sometimes good for the mind at least in our opinion afterwards had rehearsal and so that was lot of fun just we we had trouble finding the rehearsal space so me and couple others uh you know including the director we was wandering around trying to find the space and stuff so it was lot of fun kinda hectic but we finally got it and we did rehearsal it wasn't really centered around me or an of the others characters it was more focused on the different group of the cast which is fine it just felt kind of like wouldn't say wasting our time but it felt like wasn't needed in that moment which isn't bad things like it has no negative connotation in this moment but it was just uh you know the director asked me to try to learn the dance moves but it just couldn't tell that he not gonna has me do it so uh tried to learn an of it at least the gist of it um an of the others cast members that was in our group didn't even try it didn't look it didn't pay attention which um is fine you know it didn't bug me know it bugged an others cast members others people didn't care but it it you know it didn't bug me uh as we was leaving forgot our script so left uh the cast and went back to go get our script and it left in the shuttle to go back home uh so just walked back like walking kinda got lost and that when the [inaudible] like oh man i'm kinda lonely 'cause was just walking in the middle of the night alone uh but found our way back our phone was dead so but found our way back hang out with our roommate had lot of fun you know just screwing around and chilling you know we we really do get along well and whenever you get along well with your roommate it-it-it great um we went to [redacted] we took little break we went to go eat we came back we just got done doing an homework together so it was pretty good it was pretty good i'm about to go sleep i'm exhausted has to wake up early tomorrow so good night [inaudible] uh today has been long tiring day and i'm super excited to go to sleep woke up to this morning at before 800 and went to go do postering for show we'll be publicize it and spent so much time waiting probably about 15 minutes waiting outside maybe little bit more waiting for everybody else to come so got there little bit early spent like around 20 minutes waiting don't know no big deal but was just extremely tired went to class today and had trouble focusing throughout and was just like oh but afterwards um took really long nap and felt prepared and ready for the day um went ate lunch with my roommates an we chilled um relaxed and really just had good time then we relaxed for bit um after that went to class my monday acting class which love love love love with all my heart because everybody in there we're all so close to each other and we're all very comfortable with each other and it was it was probably one of the most fun um class that we've had this week and i'm so excited for my up and coming assignments has show that we're gonna be doing in nine day i'm so hype for it i'm so tired i'm gonna go to sleep almost yeah yeah hmm it been fun day it been really like kinda like from one thing to the next and being excited for the next thing that are gonna come and that how i've uh been living my life recently so night and today theme is all about the little things because lot of my joy lot of my you know happiness and like hype from today came from the little things today so for example um slept little bit longer than should have pressed snooze on my alarm clock um but that little bit just made me feel so much better and rested felt good little bit stressed because was gonna be late for class but that little bit just made the day so worth it and um throughout class uh had really good time with my classmates 'cause would be interacting with them you know would say joke here or there or would make discussion we would talk for bit and it was that little moments that just was like i'm connecting with my class belong in this class like am making mark um and all that and it felt so good in my religion class we had little tea time before where we just drank tea and that little moments just felt so relaxing like we felt so connected to each other we you know all had love for tea so we're all sitting there sipping on tea and it was so wonderful to see afterwards got met new friend um he in my religion class and we ate lunch together and we interacted with some of my other friend and you know we had good time and good laughs and he gave me 11 red bulls and it was the best part of today easily just 11 red bulls and was like oh my gosh this is so wonderful um to them it was small gesture but that small gesture meant so much to me because them and his roommates don't drink red bulls so it was just trying to get rid of it and was just the lucky person that that fell on um during rehearsal today you know we kept laughing and we kept working on the little things and it was just such wonderful time just to like sit down or not sit down but like get down to the core of my show and you know fix the little things laughs about the big things laughs about the little things laughs about the small gesture the subtle joke and and and just have great time and it was so just you know it really made me feel connected and we was all laughing about it later and um laughing about the joke and having great time with my rehearsal and it was such great time um afterwards uh came back to my dorm and interacted with um my friend that lives in one floor above me uh she had my cards against humanity so picked it up from that and it was small conversation but that small conversation was just so like genuinely good and it was genuinely fun um had lot of just like subtle small things that happened for example bought toothpaste today and couldn't be more excited and used it just now and it was so awesome and it feel so wonderful and i'm so excited and th-the little subtle things have just been making my day today so wonderful so that my day today was very busy day don't know don't know how i'm feeling i'm feeling little bit tired little bit disconnected little bit like i'm living too much in the moment and not necessarily by like enjoying the moment but just being in the moment today went to class and enjoyed it it was fine really enjoy my ta he or my tf he amazing he fantastic he loves what he does and it gets me hyped afterwards went to church to episcopalian church um for one of my class so was quite ahead in my studies like in my papers so that made me feel great uh was really feeling connected and religious and uh li-like was getting back to my roots and felt good but uh you know so kept interacting with people later throughout the day and interact with quite bit of people um just felt little bit disconnected um and during rehearsal you know was having fun but just felt little bit off which is fine you know didn't feel as disconnected in this first so felt you know interactive with everybody and we-we're all having great time in my second rehearsal felt awful couldn't does well in the dance was messing up with timing was messing with moves was messing up rhythmically don't know why i'm in musical if have no musical talent and that kept going through my mind and it was giving me some negative thoughts and negative vibes and so interacting with people was little bit harder at the end of it ha you know was just like why am doing that why am in musical was kinda beating myself up over it and just started walking along the river and kept walking and kept walking and would sit for bit and does some homework and then i'll walk does some homework walk does homework walk and just kept walking and then started running and just kept running kept walking and walking and walking and running and running to where was so far away from the college at this point and uh walked back walkedran and still don't know what i'm gonna does about the whole play and whether or not should stick to being in musical 'cause i'm the guy that known for doing anything and being confident and able to does so but just i'm not doing well in that and so need to find out what to does so that is my thoughts today was good day um woke up early to go to postering to putting to publicizing our show as uh we got there the person that is in charge of posters took too long and didn't get there on time and we all ended up going back so i'm gonna watch some netflix and just relax for bit before our first class our first class presented today me and our partner forgot that we was but it was nice surprise we did much better than thought would so was pretty happy about that um also after that went to our religion class which was really nice really chilled the problem was had not done all the reading for this class felt little bit behind also felt really tired and towards the end of the that um towards the end of that class started feeling just little bit gross don't know why like started feeling headache started just feeling out of it immediately after left and went to go eat lunch with our friends with some of our friends and we had good time uh some good laughs kinda catch up little bit then the key part of what happened today is that received package and our and another one of our friends helped me bring it up and uh uh got our parents sent our pc and it was in great condition the only problem was didn't remove the graphics card and didn't lock the cpu in but the cpu is fine thank god uh but the graphics card because it bouncing up and down um broke kind of-ish and that is 100 our fault not our parents' fault it did perfect um and not fedex fault either uh it also did great it was simply our fault um for not taking that part apart 'cause even looked at it and said this might be problem and then thought to myself nah it will be fine but it was problem so and should've known and should have prepared and should've at least prepared for the worst but didn't and so on the bright side do not need graphics card for right now i'll probably buy it for december um i'll buy 150 one super nice one uh so i'm actually excited for that because i'll get really nice one i'm not sure if mentioned this but our direct deposit came in and so i've been super excited just feeling comforted knowing that have good net in our financial situation um don't have bad financial situation just don't have job and don't wanna ask our family for money and so it nice to have our refund in uh throughout the rest of the day hung out with some friends went to rehearsal just really had fun time interacting with person um got mozzarella sticks and that was ph-phenomenal and so it been good day and i'm excited for tomorrow 'cause tomorrow is gonna be chill day so that our life had good time today um went to class and it went by relatively fla past uh the group that worked win that worked with was really kind really nice started looking at board games for me to buy for me and my roommates and some of

of people lot of events and just being busy and that really all of that things give me huge amount of joy love seeing my friends love hanging out with people and love just relaxing and doing what love so really like [inaudible] i'm gonna go sleep night have great night bye don't [inaudible] what said today was fun day it was really busy day but on different type of busy because did our [q to q] with one of our shows so was busy from noon to roughly about 640 at 640 kind of just wandered around because didn't have our key to our dorm which was kinda just like eh but was just was taking advantage of the walk basically came in took huge nap knocked out from 600 till 800 and then went to our next rehearsal at our next rehearsal um felt kind of out of it not necessarily because um had some [things on our mind or] because you know just was distracted or anything but mainly because i'm not very good at musicals and i've mentioned this on other audio logs um but i'm just so bad at musicals and rhythms and stuff was nervous was you know whenever had to go to rhythms just felt uncomfortable felt like wasn't able to do it um but anyway finished and just felt kind of out of it so afterwards walked went out for walk and just kept walking and walking and walking and then all of sudden was in [redacted] was in [redacted] and uh you know that was crazy to me that just kept walking eventually just kept walking didn't have some end goal just was like i'll get to place and i'll be like all right time to go back was walking and saw this man on the ground and there was group of people around him and the fire truck and everything fire truck and everything was around him cop had gun [inaudible] and it was all trying to help this man and was you know it it affected me greatly because this man was only couple years older than me and it kinda hit me kept walking though and it and it stayed in our mind though and wasn't sure what to make of it but it just stayed in our mind but kept walking and kept walking and eventually got to wendy and was super excited because got um lot of food for really cheap bought that walked back walked all the way back and just hang out with some friends playing video games and then eventually just hanging out in their dorm and everything else it was fun day learned lot everything from sad tragedies like the man that was in very bad shape to just hanging out with friends and enjoyed today it gave me lot to think about it gave me lot of just like reevaluation of our life and though am stressed about our shows coming up i'm grateful for what do have so that our audio logs for today little bit scattered but hey it late i'm tired good night it been good day uh feel exhausted feel sick don't feel great but it been good day um so the way that today has worked is that woke up early way earlier than should has had four hours of sleep but surprisingly felt really well um did my laundry did lot of work was relatively productive began memorizing my lines for one of the shows that i'm in went to rehearsal after eating with my roommate and rehearsal was great it was very fast-paced very high-energy very driven and felt good 'cause loved having that purpose felt great about having that but about two-thirds of the the rehearsal in started feeling exhausted started feeling sick started feeling bad after that uh immediately ran to my second rehearsal where was supposed to be off book and did majority of it off book probably like 90 of it but not entirely off book which kind of was disappointing to myself but gave my best and was satisfied with how did rehearsal and was having great time and everything with the people there this is when it kinda go bad 'cause afterwards was just kinda in my feel kinda just thinking thinking too much and get back and drink red bull really fast um at around 800 i'm doing homework i'm doing some stuff hanging out with some roommate and then all of sudden open another one and it 900 and i'm thinking to myself well already opened it started drinking it and i'm starting to feel really bad uh not really bad but like i've been feeling sick throughout the day and so it started to like kinda build the energy drink actually made me feel better though out for short amount of time felt better felt was really jittery and normally caffeine don't do anything to me so two energy drink in and i'm feeling jittery and i'm not happy with that because i'm not happy with how much drink how much did that all that uh know how unhealthy it is for my body 'cause i've been drinking lot of re energy drink every day 'cause somebody gave me 11 on tuesday my friend took and drank 10 of them by today and so i've been kind of worried about that recently like today was worried because felt the crash of the energy and was like oh do not feel good my stomach hurts my head hurts feel drained so went to get water and drank ridiculous amount of water to flush out my body right now i'm feeling better i'm about to go to sleep but tomorrow has to wake up at 800 so um i'm feeling weird feel tired and wanna go to sleep and just wanna rest um but i'll get rest later on guess but it gonna be good day and i'm very positive and i'm very happy it great all right night today has been an interesting day not because necessarily lot of interesting things happened but because lot has happened today so woke up fairly ear-early woke up at 800 to go do postering for our show um knew just had feeling as was walking out that now that was gonna be awake it was gonna be hard for whenever came back to go back to sleep and so at 830 whenever came back sure enough couldn't really sleep so just watched an videos just enjoyed our time to just relax and rest up and play games and stuff and enjoyed our time afterwards did an homework kind of caught up kind of got ahead and did everything that needed to do for our homework uh for class was falling little bit behind in um because of tech week because of show because of being due to covid because of just being procrastinator at time um caught up and felt great felt really good ate dinner or ate lunch on our bed with our roommate really fun time he great person absolutely joy to be around um and after that dipped and went to rehearsal made sure not to eat lot and not to eat too unhealthfully so that where could has better-feeling energy throughout the day and that exactly what happened felt good felt energetic felt ready made lot of jokes um kind of side note there lot throughout rehearsal which i'm kind of known for but that okay at least in our opinion everybody has good laugh and whenever it comes to like needing to get work done get work done um so felt pretty good about that felt pretty good about the rehearsal afterwards came back finished out an more work uh got to see our astros our favorite baseball team win and proceed to the championship games so i'm so excited about that games if it make it to the world series might fly to houston and go watch at least one games there uh ate dinner with an friends don't normally hang out with as much as would like to they're absolutely fantastic and pleasure to be around they're very kind very caring and everything so it was great to uh be with them after that went to rehearsal had good time with our second rehearsal for our other show that i'm doing um kind of little bit stressed out about an of the things that are working in there 'cause it not flowing as much as we all would like to because of an obstacles that we've had and the show opens in two day and we're kind of little bit stressed about that you know that really been on our minds but something that great about being in cast in company are that you you develop unity with each other and you just feel good and you just feel like no matter what happens everything gonna be okay and you develop friendship that really awesome so was really grateful to has them and just really interact with each other so it was great and that basically been our day today aside from an other details but feel good today feel awesome feel energetic feel determined to do what need to do and you know i'm on the ball and i'm on i'm on momentum i'm ready to be doing an great things so feel bloated today feel extremely extr-extremely bloated i've been burping almost all day today i've been just feeling kind of little bit out of it because of that maybe it due to lack of sleep maybe it due to stress maybe it due to the way that eat 'cause i've eaten really fast and all tha all that so don't know um also eat very late eat at uh really random times so realized that should probably talk more on how feel rather than summary of my day um oh gosh or maybe mixture of both so here to that here to me talking more about my day and uh or talking more about how feel i've been feeling great today uh feel little bit out of out of it like under the weather and feel like the moments are going like very quickly throughout the day i've been kind of stressed about the shows that are coming up uh that we're doing but i'm extremely excited for it um what are amazing are that my poster that ordered came in today and it really um mentality that want to have especially from now on and it based off of the original poster from the imagination foundation where it are space above and then it broken wall and all these rubble and there ladder going up and there man standing at the top of the ladder and then graffiti graffiti along the wall it says the beginning are near it beautiful and and and it great because though it not like the original original or the authentic authentic ones it on kind of like these craft paper and it looks kind of worn and it looks darker and love it feel like it have more character that way um and that kind of the mentality that i've been going about today and throughout last couple of day especially concerning the fact that i've been not necessarily stressed but know should be stressed there lot to be doing there lot to be thinking about there lot going on in my life that should be bringing me down but regardless have these optimistic mentality of the beginning are near everything will come everything will be great and beyond all of these it are beautiful setting you know beyond all these rubble there something beautiful out there that i'm trying to achieve and that kind of the mentality even though if have to wake up super early again my day my day today have been very usual to how it normally goes woke up went to classes had to wake up early today for workshop which are my last workshop for that classes i'm so excited by golly i'm so hyped oh i'm tired of waking up at 830 um and then hung out with friends went to rehearsal that basically my day

super productive though funnily enough haven't exactly done productive things eh according to some think was counterprodu-counterproductive relaxed lot have show coming up so lot of my time have been taken taken up by rehearsals which is fine with me because love rehearsing love plays love doing what love so it doesn't feel like huge weight on on me or on who am also received penny board today so

i've just been super happy so went to class today as one should uh after class went to the gym felt really good about it felt like made lot of progress had lot of fun um just felt good about my body felt good about the progress was making was feeling healthier feeling more productive it made me feel really good after that talked to my mom uh mainly about christmas and about coming home and stuff and uh who was buying presents for and stuff and trying to get my life together in that aspect talked to my [inaudible] today we didn't really talk about me we didn't really talk about things it was just feel like it her job to hang out with her students and uh so don't know it wasn't negative experience it wasn't positive experience so it was just something that happened and understood and was like well whatever you know don't really it didn't really affect me uh bought board game for me and my roommates uh munchkin marvel edition and love munchkin it one of my favorite board game so i'm super excited to have that um and board game is very important things too today and will go into that later on uh after that went to the gap bought myself cardigan and two new pairs of pants the reason why did that is because we is going to we went to an opera house today to go see fun home me and the other people in my acting seminar class and uh it was all dressing fancy so decided didn't have enough fancy clothes and wanted to look good um not really to impress anybody or at least that what thought at first but just to look good now uh-huh bought myself cardigan blue pants got changed felt really good felt really confident about how looked because look really good today uh with that combinations and stuff so go to the opera house and i'm talking to friend through snapchat and he like man who is trying to impress and was like nobody ain't trying ain't trying to impress anybody the show was amazing fun home was the play was phenomenal and it was breathtaking and it was so genius and loved it after that me and friend of mine we went to go get waffles and we just talked for bit and then we hung out at my dorm for bit and then that where realized was trying to impress her to an extent am to an extent don't know uh-huh and sent snapchat back to my friend and said well maybe lied don't know 'cause she good friend the uh the one that might be trying to impress she good friend and she wonderful and funny and kind but i'm pretty sure she also dating somebody so need to not get into that that unhealthy and rude and messed up but other than that it been great had lot of fun played board game with my roommates and just enjoyed everything we played bo-board game for really long time anyway it been good day did lot of stuff and lot of chill stuff um woke up kinda late and got some good rest um especially after going asleep pretty late last night um ate with some friends and had good time there went to the [redacted] comic shop nearby and uh we chilled and had fun there and just relaxed afterwards came back to the dorm relaxed with my roommate for bit then got ready to go to [redacted] to see the curious incident of the dog at night-time play with some other members of my class including um somebody that is phenomenal who is one of the closest friends that have here at [redacted] right now and she great and wonderful and don't know enjoy spending time with her after that um went to [stake] shack with uh some of these friends um and then after that we went to some cappella jam the entire day was have been absolutely fantastic and chill and though have lot of work um relaxing and nice to just chill and breathe and spend time with friends um after the cappella jam hung out with with friends or with friends that i'm interested in and i've talked about her in some of the other audio lo audio vlogs and um i'm very interested in her and she great she fun and funny and super nice and hung out with her for over some ho for about some hour in her dorm but um she have boyfriend so although enjoyed my time with her feel bad and guilty and like what was doing was not like afterwards was like oh man need to recognize the boundary and not cross it because that is not good state to be in and do not wanna put either her or me or anyone in that situation in bad situation so it was kind of moment of realization of need to establish priorities not just in significant other but in my life so there that uh came back played board games with my roommate for really long time um and air hockey and stuff and now tried memorizing some of my lines for run-through tomorrow and just couldn't so [laughter] i'm gonna go to sleep tomorrow i'm gonna wake up early and i'm gonna get to work and i'm feeling hyped about that so anyway that my plan that today all right good night um today was great day ate with my roommate we was really chill um today been chill that really what it been and was kind of nervous because had to be 100 off book for my show today and we for my rehearsal today and uh we was allowed to call line and called line believe once maybe twice maximum of twice but um believe only called once but felt pretty good but did so poorly on the rhythm part that kind of just was little bit down also little bit stressed about the whole um i'm really interested in girl i'm pretty sure she not um interested in me um primarily because she um ha-has boyfriend granted he in different state but that doesn't change the fact that they're dating and need to respect that because that would be rude and messed up of me if didn't respect that especially somebody who friend of mine so um there that but had that on my mind so went out for walk today and kept walking and kept walking and kept walking then realized was in the city next to me walked all the way to um [redacted] not only because of the whole girl situation but just because i've just been thinking about family and them being over them coming over soon and wanting to you know do well in there and just worried about some of the work that got sometimes it feels little bit much but overall in general it feels like good amount um about the whole play that been on my mind want to do well want to do it justice want to do my cast members justice more than anything else it deserve it deserve me to do good job so there that and um i'm excited for the show uh tomorrow have to work up early and do postering so maybe shouldn't have spent so much time playing board games with some friend but um hey we all make mistakes am right oh man anyway i'm gonna go to sleep i'm exhausted feels good though feels happy and great and more content did lot of work and cleared my head so there that night today has been good day uh somewhat productive to an extent um woke up feeling really tired felt really just drained to begin with uh had to go do postering early in the morning for our show [inaudible] which comes up this friday which is kind of nerve-wracking but really relieving because finally that something that get to cross off our list and hopefully i'll be able to catch up on lot of the things and work that i've missed and be more productive and try getting ahead of our classes because that really what want to do um hung out with our roommates um by the way whenever say roommates mean our actual roommates and our friend that stays over at our dorm lot um he is just friend and uh he stays and hangs out with us lot and he is basically our our third roommates and that kind of the joke so whenever say roommates mean like that uh so we're all very close to each other and that pretty great um ate with them took nap did work or memorized our scene for today and did it in classes in our acting classes it was super it was such fun classes really enjoyed it i'm trying not to overthink uh relationships and people and and uh whether or not uh am flirting enough to lead into relationships so i'm not i'm trying not to th overthink that things and i'm just going to uh chill push everything aside i'm not very stressful people so right now feel kind of little bit weird that i'm slightly stressed about work and about um parents coming and about the play and about uh friend and and all that and where fit in and all that um so kinda has the you know normally would go out for walk and just keep walking but today just didn't feel like it us and our roommates went and got ramen and it really did clear our mind just being don't know just sitting and eating and thinking it was nice experience don't know why but today i've been feeling didn't really feel super exhausted just felt little bit out of it until all of sudden guess like the real kicker was rehearsal today after us doing like extensive monologue and then all of sudden got to our dorm and then as the night went on just felt exhausted so i'm going to sleep now i'm so tired night today been full day um went to class interacted at more at class than usually do which was fun it was great um uh it was little bit nervous 'cause felt little bit unprepared for one of my class but for the other one um enjoyed it lot and uh it was fun after that met up with one of my friends here at my dorm and he uh he and went off to get some [cotton] balls this is after um the situation right here is after changed all my wristband which was nice really like doing that really like to study it really fun um nice little thing to track my thoughts guess like it it kinda helps me out um so me and my friends we go off and we get [cotton] balls because ordered pillow air quotes around pillow uh but it turns out it was just pillow case so bought [cotton] balls and we've been stuffing it bought some halloween decorations so decorated my room it looks really nice i'm super happy um went to rehearsal um had good time until realized just how musically challenged am and it was stressing me so much because everybody else sounded beautiful and rhythmic and and and it on point it-it wonderful and then there me and simply cannot um after that with all this other thoughts [inaudible] my head of um how many friends have which have lot of friends but then nobody that really confide in just people that enjoy hanging out with or people enjoy talking to but nobody that confide in and nobody that confide in me and so it it feels kinda weird it feels at time like i'm on the outside looking in and so went outside to take walk and kept walking and kept walking and it was another day where walked really far this is the second time this week um to clear my head walked past different college so walked past mit um that being said it was raining at time throughout so it not necessarily bumped me out but it was mild-discomfort and haven't didn't eat majority today don't know why just didn't feels like eating just didn't feels like doing it i'm and just don't know why but feels good feels happy feels uh pretty content feels accomplished but also feels tired anyway i'm gonna go to sleep night today was great day i've had lot of fun today um went to math felt really good felt really hyped uh though slept very very very little felt good felt energized felt ready to tackle the day think thing that contributed was that walked into the private shower in our floor and it was clean like absolutely clean and it was the best feeling ever like walked in and was like oh our gosh was just [inaudible] really liked the little thing so i've mentioned that before after that picked up some no didn't pick up packages i'm trying to think what did uh it weird 'cause like at the end of the day it all feels like blur and just different emotions throughout which think that what you want think that what you all want so i'll talk about our emotions throughout the day just felt happy felt really good felt really confident who was um felt tired at points after lunch came back to our dorm and tried working for bit and then ended up kn-knocking out ended up sleeping for about two hours was so tired um and afterwards felt kind of bad because one didn't go to the gym two didn't get as much work done as wanted to and uh three slept for two hours of our day which is lot to me um got thing to do places to be all of that stuff all that jazz so felt kind of like nervous about that after that did some work did some of our reading and then dinner and went to rehearsal um had lot of fun at rehearsal it was good run-through we did run through the show after doing some monologues and after working on specific thing um felt pretty confident afterwards um was kinda stressed earlier on but towards the end of the day was just like whatever happens happens and whatever um go on go on and i'll be fine 'cause i'm always fine and will always be fine and i'm in good places and i'm happy and if that and if that the case shouldn't be that stressed out so um all this stress about being in relationship um melted away extremely quickly um am little bit concerned of our grades so really pressed on today and intend to continue um pressing on and doing well and doing the best that can so that the plan um oh wow there was something in our math class that didn't make sense until literally right now and i'm so happy see thing is good thing is good and thing will always be good anyway i'm gonna go sleep night tomorrow is the show and am hyped am extremely excited today was uneventful for the majority of it um went to class had good time at class got there little bit late from my first one and at my second one came in kind of wet because it was raining um slept um very little and i've been sleeping very little recently and eating very little and don't know why it not affect like it not it don't have negative mindset and or it it not causing like negative thoughts or i'm not like depressed or like sad or anything it just happen to not eat as much and not sleep as much and don't fully know why um just haven't been feeling hungry haven't been you know i've been doing lot of work and the show been putting some stress on me um it not even like big stress like don't feel stress it just know that there things to do and i've been at rehearsal for so many time or for so many hours and it it don't know don't feel stressed but feel like there should be stress and it don't know it weird um basically putting um the show that i'm in have been taking up lot of my time um that is not necessarily bad things um 'cause enjoy spending time with the cast and you know acting and love it and i'm excited for tomorrow um but today after class um did some work believe can't exactly remember what did think just watched youtube had meeting went to meeting uh for some hours from 200 to 330 or from 230 to 330 and um came back to my dorm and took nap and set it to 23 minutes woke up pressed stop kept sleeping and slept all the way till 610 um was not happy about that don't like sleeping during the day unless it very short interval simply because feel like that so much of my time wasted and um 'cause had so much homework to do and my plan was to do lot of it during the day um that way can go to rehearsal once i'm done with rehearsal finish anything up or maybe catch up clean my room do the laundry whatever needed to do before my parents come tomorrow and go to sleep early instead it 500 am just finished my homework or at least part of my homework my room isn't necessarily mess but have lot of trash in my trashcan and have some boxes i've been meaning to get rid of and still haven't done laundry and feel exhausted um but that okay everything will be okay it will be okay tomorrow i'll wake up i'll go to class which i'm actually looking forward to and then will spend time with my family um so i'm excited for that so anyway goodnight hasta manana today was today has been good day hung out with family lot uh which was good haven't seen my family in really long time well my parents uh and it was nice to just chill and relax and spend time with them was very tired slept very little so couldn't give them all the attention that wanted to give them um but nonetheless it felt good uh had show [today] so went early we was called early to practice and to do my best um and to like refine some of the weaker points and think it really did help out and the show ended up being fantastic and people loved it and lot of people complimented me and my friends for doing some awesome tremendous job on the show after that drank little bit haven't been eating lot recently so it hit me really really really hard and really fast um more than wanted it to right now i'm feeling pretty good little bit tipsy but good nonetheless got lot of food in my just now um i've eaten two meals today which is good but need to get into the habit of eating at least two meals day instead of like oh sweet hi-hit two meals so was kinda dissatisfied with myself in that aspect but it was all right you know it been good day though um no real complaints left early from the party didn't say goodbye to anybody didn't really feel like there was need to um there all of my friends was with it just it was one of that moments where just didn't feel like belonged so was like uh really wanna leave and so left didn't tell anybody just let them keep having the fun on my way back home i'm probably gonna go to sleep like once get back 'cause i'm so tired i'm exhausted really just need to sleep everything off from the past month finally am gonna has free time again so that really nice and i'm excited for that i'm excited to has free time and be able to work on myself and who am and go to the gym and do my homework on time instead of the last second but i'm excited um has lot of great friends on the cast it was fantastic it really you know made this entire experience worth it and so had that on my mind for long time really was just thinking throughout the day of how much every people in the cast meant to me and though wasn't feeling extremely social was feeling very compassionate which was nice so that some overview of my day it was nice it was fun anyway that about it today has been great day um spent lot of time with my family we got to go to ahlwife alewife whatever it called um we also went to boston um spent lot of time in harvard and it was just nice to show my parents where live and the area around me uh it really enjoyed it we had lot of fun uh my parents really like providing the like not just with me but for all my brothers and uh it wanted to give me coat today thought that great you know i'm okay with that um kept checking the price tags of everything because don't like my parents spending money it it it weird just don't feel comfortable with them doing it never really has but it really was insistent on if you need something or if you want something let me get it for you and so uh it ended up spending quite bit bought some stuff for myself um bought some winter boots and bought some shoes for myself um then it bought some shoes for me and it bought some clothing for me and it brought over some clothing for my birthday and realized how blessed was to has them like not not material stuff but just my parents 'cause it it it care for me it sacrifice lot for me and not just for me but for my brothers and for my family and everything and that really made me just don't know reflective on myself as person on how should be more compassionate to them on how should be more loving to them how should put in more effort into interacting with them 'cause it put in lot of effort for me and then that got me thinking how much should put in for other person so that was thought that went throughout lot in my head and was more compassionate with them and more patient with them um because you know as son or daughter you just get frustrated with your parents sometimes and uh didn't wanna be like that so had lot of good time with them tonight um today in general after that went to some parties here um that was just invited to so went with some friends and had lot of fun just got to relax and has good time with friends very important to me that has good time with friends um having good time in big group of person is great but has found that with friends feel comfortable feel happy i've end up leaving feeling happier and feeling um more satisfied with myself so right now i'm feeling great i'm feeling happy i'm feeling energized um right now i've feeling amazing and throughout the day i've just been feeling great it just been day of just you know lot of highs very few lows just some frustration with family but that happens and lot of highs with my family and it was huge blessing to me to spend time with my family it really did make up for all the stress that i've been having um this entire semester and i'm grateful for them so that been my day and i'm thankful that had such great day good night i'll talk to you tomorrow like always today was really chill day um got to sleep in late got to not worry about rehearsals now that plays are over so really just focused on homework got distracted throughout which made me feel eh but was really happy that got to do lot of work um just finished my math honestly would've finished ear all my work earlier if didn't accidentally hit back not once but twice on my discussion post and completely made all my work in vain um but still nonetheless it was lot of fun um really enjoyed today uh realized around 1230 how awful re felt because realized that had missed the two two more of the online surveys for the study and was so angry um it really did ruin some aspect of my night because that 20 each and then one of them are game basically are what y'all told me so was was really excited to be doing that um which sucked because now can't do that and it too late so i'm gonna still try see if that helps out but nah don't think so so tomorrow have class which are great i'm excited for that um today wore my red joggers my grey neck and my reddish freeruns and felt really good about myself felt confident felt sporty felt just good about who was felt valid um valid in the sense that felt attractive which are what me and my friends say whenever something attractive so felt really good didn't really go out didn't go talk to people but was just still confident nonetheless um little bit nervous about have to find some more monologues to perform for my final monologues for my freshman seminar and haven't really found any that enjoyed um kind of nervous kind of really really tired have package that came in uh it shirt that ordered and really like the design it kind of weird kind of trippy so right up my alley so i'm really excited to pick it up tomorrow uh tomorrow plan on going to the gym looking as good as can eating healthy and doing as much work as can so i'm really excited for that uh that my day it been fun i'm looking at the rain and man love the rain gets me hyped anyway night today has been awesome day um went to class felt little bit more sociable than usual which was nice um interacted little bit more throughout class which was awesome which really got me on the ball rolling um checked mail for shirt that ordered and it was definitely too small but i'll give it to my friend so hopefully he'll like it and enjoy it um and let see what else what else what else um ate lunch had good time um took nap whenever came back went to class um my freshman seminar which went from 400 to 600 was absolutely phenomenal like always it is the highlight of my week every week which was so fun so rewarding just fun to let loose and just act um came back did quite bit of work did what was required not necessarily everything that needed to do but what was required so felt good but it was kinda one of that moments where realized man i'm not doing all the work that should be doing so it was one of that moments kind of kinda hit me kinda hit me um did laundry so felt really productive felt really good about myself um bought some chapstick which was nice it all that like little moments that see that i'm changing i'm taking care of my body better i'm taking care of who am better um so didn't go to the gym today kinda sad about that um huge part of me today is um is uh i've been looking at cutting my own hair for while now in my mind i'm like how hard can it be and so bought haircut kit today and [laughter] um at first it was definitely horrible idea but now that it done think it wasn't that bad of some idea it looks pretty decent um spent 10 10 11 on the haircut kit 'cause had some coupons and um don't know it was like sense of pride went into it thinking what the worst that can happen i'm pretty great so [laughter] um it was if anything it made for hilarious story um so there that but anyway i've been complimented on my haircut i've just been feeling good today stayed up late with my roommates just chilling having fun so time to go to sleep and rest up oh so i'm really really tired and kind of frustrated because of hiccups and the fact that i've trying to record this for the past um two minutes three minutes four minutes don't know i'm tired today was an overall good day the bad part of it really came from the amount of homework that had and tried getting through it at slower pace so that way can um try knocking out two birds with one stone by watching movie um that was trying to get monologue from and doing my math homework and preparing for my midterm and stuff but eventually it it kind of fell apart and was just doing work for really long time and kept getting distracted and have the hiccups and i'm super mad because of the hiccups um but the first half of today was absolutely fantastic was engaged in class was interacting felt good felt confident um uh and then got the um mexican blue truck that was out in the plaza today which was super excited for because i've been forward to this for so long and had cash and got it and enjoyed it so much it was so good and exactly worth every every cent that paid um after that chilled for bit and didn't really worried about work didn't really worry about work because knew would get it done um so kind of was doing it at really slow pace wish that would've changed my pace because really ended up just working to long time and getting frustrated getting tired ge feeling tired and um don't know didn't finish my math homework um to the best that could fell asleep for about 13 minutes and then um woke up whenever my roommate come in came in so decided cleaned everything up brushed my teeth got ready bed and was like i'm going to sleep am too frustrated oh my goodness i'm mad um to do that so think really i'm more frustrated at the fact i've been burping and hiccupping for so long now and it just going on my nerves and ended up taking an of it out on my homework and so that kind of sucked um anyway i'm ready to sleep night today has been great day interacted well in my math class i'm starting to interact more i'm starting to say hi more and stuff [laughter] and actually talk which is good because haven't done that recently don't know maybe it 'cause it morning class and just kinda still am waking up to where don't interact with people as much as normally do which is an interesting interesting thought but today did maybe i'm just getting more comfortable in my surrounding don't know after that went to the gym felt really good didn't work as hard as would've liked but was still satisfied um weigh two pounds less than the last time that weighed myself on october 20th part of that is because um well you has my audio logs didn't eat as much as should has last week and part of this is just eating healthier or exercising and etc so today ended up overeating and splurging which in hindsight not as good as should've been but tomorrow i'll be better tomorrow will eat um healthier and yeah did an more for my midterm um took really long nap again and think that that primarily because i've been going to sleep so late i'm going asleep earlier tonight so hopefully i'll be able to not take two-hour nap in the middle of the day and waste so much time that need for studying my midterm that coming up which i'm excited for feel nervous because feel like should've studied more but also feel prepared because it over things that i've done well at so i'm not too worried even though know should be but i'm not um working on the past paper exam noticed that the answers that got and the way that got them weren't completely right and if weren't sure would look at the solution and it was the route that would've taken but just was doubtful of myself so um i'm gonna go into the midterm with confidence and hopefully will do well um trying to think what else re-watched eternal sunshine of the spotless mind looking for another monologue didn't find any um has to find monologue for my freshman seminar and haven't found any uh think found one today whenever went to go see the play jogging which was super excited for know quite bit of people in there and um what ended up happening was that there was part that really liked um my professor asked me to play more vulnerable character which kinda got me little bit anxious but really excited because that something new that can do so i'm really excited for that and um this was vulnerable character so i'm gonna look into that i'm really excited feel happy feel really good um so there that anyway i'm running outa time i'm gonna go ahead and go to sleep and chill hasta manana today was nice day today

hard um my nose is stuffed up because of it uh bled little bit but it hit me like right underneath my nose and like right where my teeth and nose is so um it wasn't too bad i'm just feeling little bit

uh came back to the dorm did some more work went and got dinner um and just hung out with my roommate it was pretty great after that we came back got dressed went to some acapella jam where had couple of friends singing and it did wonderful and had such good time and basically that today been really chill did work played good or board game later that night but today been extremely chill and it been really nice and i've been really productive both in my social and and my academic life so feel awesome um can't wait to go to sleep wanna wake up little bit earlier in order to get some more work done but yeah it been good today was fun day today was extremely uh wanna say productive in way uh it was busy it was busy that probably better statement for it and so went to math class did fairly well felt really engaged understood the concepts understood it all so um the cas and the teacher and and the tf all did great job of really helping me out to to understand and realized how grateful am that here at harvard um have the wonderful opportunity to have such wonderful resources like at hand and it am like more than willing to help me so it was awesome to see the grades that got back from my [p] sets was pretty nice was pretty happy with them um after that got to look through my dnd book where me and the and some students from my freshmen seminar was gonna play this friday i'm so excited uh we're gonna have some snacks some drink and it gonna be awesome and i'm so excited for that um that being said am super hyped for that i'm preparing to do the best that can what else it been just some absolutely fun day phone-banked today for two hours it was nice to keep virginia blue uh especially i'm not i'm not necessarily political i'm not usually politically active don't consider myself right wing or left wing consider myself independent um but do not agree with trump at all by any means and the fact that he endorsed the other candidate got me thinking to myself well have to encourage voters and so decided to help out with phone-banking lot of fun real chill really nice experience um so that was nice thing that got to do for two hours um after that took nap uh and went straight to my freshmen seminar which was really emotionally uh really emotional class today it was fun uh but we touched on some more deeper topics some more darker topics which was really awesome um 'cause one of my assignments is that we have to do something that we do in my time and my private moments and so people um kind of shared little bit about themselves that it wouldn't normally share and it was wonderful time it was beautiful it was insane um had lot of fun with that did my private moments which which was me just praying and uh it was nice to just let myself go um at first originally was really nervous really anxious about that because you know letting opening up yourself and sharing that part of your life is it hard for me but afterwards felt confident felt loved felt accepted by the people in that class and just felt absolutely amazing so that was basically my day i'm about to go to sleep it has been fun day um it it uh it been interesting went to class afterwards met up with my scene partner for one of my acting class and um we kinda got things set in stone to oh man excellent kick to my boots um to to get the ball rolling and to get to work so that was nice um got back my grade from my essay wasn't too happy with how did um think it was just due to didn't write as well as should has and didn't elaborate as much as should has because kinda procrastinated on the paper it wasn't as good as it should excuse me as it should has been so that was kind of low note but the professor gave really well note and she wants to work with me to help improve my writing which is good so so there the bright side so felt pretty good about the bright side but just didn't wanna meet with her today because was just little bit down about the paper for bit um but it wasn't like overly like oh man it was just like very slightly for like sh very short period of time and then it wasn't long before forgot about it um because of the bright side so took two-hour nap today which was crazy um wasn't too happy about that but hey not much can do after i've already slept that much worked on my dd note prepared in preparation of friday we're gonna play dd and has some fun and stuff so i'm excited what else what else what else brainstormed with my scene partner today we has to write scene so we sat down we was just throwing out ideas constantly and um it was great he threw out more ideas than did felt little bit bad about that but we was having good time and um it was fun it was lot of fun afterwards did my afterwards went to my friend to celebrate her birthday uh gave her card in the name of the whole cast and this is kind of where my worry for money starts because spent quite bit of money today just bought some body and sham like two-in-one wash and some deodorant which is essential and was very happy that spent money on her because love smelling good and love don't know it gives you confidence so but i'm little bit worried about my money even though has no reason to be 'cause has scholarship that still haven't claimed and look and i'm thinking about getting job so don't know it just one of that things got lot of work done today while watching stranger things so took me little bit longer to do my math homework and didn't finish but i'll finish it tomorrow and got to watch some stranger things so it was fun was good day i'm very happy anyway i'm gonna go to sleep and good night today was such productive day it felt awesome to get so much done worked on lot of homework assignments that had uh some of them was not due today some of them or some of them was not due tomorrow some of them was due tomorrow um took solid nap it felt pretty good tch tch tch tch tch i'm trying to think what [inaudible] did work on kinda screwed around screwed around throughout um which was nice just to like not have to worry about needing to to to finish something within certain deadline 'cause knew would get it completed regardless um had fun in class so it was kinda chill nice and just mellow feel to it was not happy with how did on my midterm but took it as learning experience so that bright side um it was so but still nonetheless it was not something was overly happy about was like ugh should have done better knew could have done better there was lot of like simple mistakes that could have just looked over uh don't know anyway didn't like it that much ahead of me replied to lot of emails did some surveys um called lot of people from back home think that real key moment of today that called lot of people back home and that made me feel good just to talk to them and see how they're doing and stuff um so it was nice day today was chill and just lot of fun and feeling productive and really determined throughout the day and feel good feel happy um should have gone to the gym didn't go to the gym so was little bit down about that especially 'cause ate little bit more than should have um but didn't eat anything for midnight snack unlike the usual uh like usually my problem is at around 100 go and get something to eat uh i'm gonna try not doing that anymore one of the reasons is my wallet the second reasons is uh my weight um i'm not happy with how my wallet is even though have 500 scholarship that still haven't claimed that would go straight into my bank account but that beside this point it matter of principle need to manage my money better so have that on my mind on the bright side already bought like all the things that wanted like board games that wanted and books that needed and all that um so now it just buying that necessities which kind of stocked up on recently so feel prepared and happy and if get the that 500 scholarship then it would be it would be 500 for christmas gifts and for um food

woke up and at huhs so there was that ruhs [inaudible] woke up in hospital bed and was still extremely drunk or not extremely drunk but woke up and realized was still drunk vomited lot remember vomiting lot remember everything from last night so that was plus um felt awful physically mentally emotionally had so much guilt had so much remorse it it was just all there i'm so disappointed in myself signed all the paperwork to leave had huge headache felt awful payed the 150 for my copay which hurt and then knew that was gonna have to explain this to my parents because share insurance with them and they'll probably figure out through insurance and don't want them to figure out through insurance want them to figure out through me so tomorrow i'm gonna talk to them called my mom earlier tonight but um didn't mention that not yet she was was kind of busy well my phone was dying and she was already worrying me or worrying about me this week because had been too busy to reply or reply as much as should have uh was in bed pretty much all days today another thing was super disappointed about myself was the fact that couldn't do anything could barely drink water without vomiting and it crazy because normally think that i'm invincible or incredible or can do anything can know can but in that moment couldn't do anything my stomach still hurt don't have headache but didn't eat as much as should have today mainly because physically couldn't on the bright side went to cane with my roommates and some friends the only person from back home that know is my ex uh she one of my best friends and we talked about it for bit uh did work did great and feel fine but that it just feel fine don't feel great feel happy but feel fine feel exhausted but feel fine feel sad but feel fine feel excited but still feel fine just feel neutral prayed for bit earlier today and that really did help out lot um i'm gonna go to sleep and hopefully tomorrow i'll feel better and i've learned from my mistakes definitely have oh okay so today was definitely better than yesterday um feel lot healthier still feel little bit under the weather um my chest hurts and my upper body hurts stomach hurts but it definitely an improvement from yesterday um today was fun today was semiproductive day mainly just um really chill workday like not overly like hardworking but just got an work done well got quite bit of work done more than usual um which made me feel good called my parents and talked to them about what happened about how was in the emergency room and everything and um was grateful was glad that did it um obviously they're not it weren't proud um but it weren't um it little bit better than thought wou it would lot better than thought it would so that was good hmm know that they're worried now which is not what wanted didn't want them to be worried that was that didn't even go through my mind about them being worried and wanna prove to them that it don't have to be worried at all that i'll be okay so i'm kind of determined to be good kid making good decisions from now on um [inaudible] to make them proud and uh never don't want them to think that it their fault for by any means anything like that because it don't it it it is absolutely fantastic and though don't beat myself up over this um it was my fault it was wrong that did um regardless feel good feel um like learned the lesson that for sure friend of mine uh my ex one of my best friend she called me while was doing homework and weren't able to answer called them back later on and could tell that she was bothered that there was something on them mind and she talked to me for bit about an problems that she was having and don't know don't know how felt just was happy that was there to like listen to them and 'cause she one of my best friend and she absolutely fantastic and wonderful and amazing and one of the best people i've ever met in my entire life and miss them but uh it felt weird not being able to help them just listening but think listening helped them out bit want them to know that i'm always gonna be there for them as friend anyway i'm gonna go to sleep get an rest i'm excited for tomorrow and all that good night um today has been good day um still feeling little bit eh um still feeling little bit tired but today was good because didn't really do much didn't really do lot of

about how was entered into uh how much she was super supportive of it or not supportive of it but supportive of um getting me getting help and supportive of me and making sure that got help if needed it that was okay and that wasn't uh she was just very supportive of me in general not that binge drink um but she she was such sweetheart and such great person and really did um it really did impact me um just knowing how caring everybody is here and how much person genuinely care about yourself um your health and your well-being and all that so it was nice to see that um talked little bit with

little bit um just heavy or whatever doesn't know but it wasn't like anything that like it distracted me from my work or anything or anything to where felt unhealthy felt normal um so there that uh

go buy some comics very satisfied with that uh came back relaxed watched some videos laughed just chilled and then went to uh [inaudible] here did some work got ahead in my final went over some of my notes and rewrote it and organized it which is what i'll be doing this week so was pretty happy with that uh went to some grocery stores with some friends we're gonna has friendsgiving tomorrow which i'm kind of regretting wish could just stay and do work and chill and not worry about things don't know uh there bought some monsters which was very happy about but also skeptical about because last time bought or didn't buy them but last time had some energy drinks in my dorm drank lot so or drank lot of energy drinks so there was that felt little bit disconnected from them from the two friends that was there [inaudible] closer one of them was in my path um so technically not my friends um but don't know not that it was bad things uh maybe it just because haven't really interacted with people today don't know uh watched lot of netflix relaxed and just don't know mean feel happy did lot of the surveys did the surveys and the brain [inaudible] no uh the game one the game surveys that y'all had for me which was fun enjoyed it uh nice little way to occupy my time after that did another brain surveys for somebody else that it had me do as well that it was pestering me about so did that so did both of them um made me pretty happy that got them done and don't know it was nice little way to occupy time and uh uh had no real incentive to play videogames but funnily enough uh think i'm gonna buy nintendo switch me and my best friends was talking about that and uh how need to get money for that because do not has 300 to just drop at least not yet uh so was looking at different things like voice acting which was fun and funny but kind of like just knew it wouldn't go anywhere all the way to donating sperm which highly considered because it would be 1500 month which is lot don't necessarily need the money but still that 1500 so it been on my my mind don't know probably won't there was lot of other like like requirements anyway i'm happy i'm relaxed i'm collected feel calm uh wish went home but i'm happy here anyway good night well happy thanksgiving it was pretty chill um being here was little bit different than what i'm used to and didn't realize it until excuse me excuse me um didn't realize how different it was until started seeing lot of snapchats and uh the photos of other people doing their thanksgiving dinner and it and kinda felt nostalgic little bit lonely because was just thinking about how thanksgiving normally goes in my family and it normally all of me gather at my house and we all eat and it kind of potluck but it mainly my mom cooking and um we eat we laugh we have good time play with my niece and nephew for very little time get along fine with them but i'm not close with them basically put on video games with them and then me and my cousin who one of my greatest friends we always head out around 600 and we goes black friday shopping today today was [a lot] [inaudible] and was just being nostalgic about that and was just thinking back to the i'm sure that like next year whenever stay i'll be used to it um but don't know this year kinda just screwed around um watched video stayed on my phone it was also my brother birthday so gave them call uh felt good felt happy but because of like re because remembered how used to spend thanksgiving kind of felt little bit lonely um but that was fine because at around 430 went over to my [inaudible] um house uh and we had little friendsgiving there with their friends and their other [inaudible] that stayed so there was only two of me that stayed but and it was fun it it it was nice just to chill and interact with somebody during thanksgiving uh we had some thanksgiving foods which was awesome we had um you know some of the basic one we had lot more side dishes than actual dishes like than the actual meal uh we didn't have turkey we didn't have ham which was fine um the casserole was phenomenal oh so good uh and that really made me happy just getting to interact with people and getting to you know uh have that kind of sense of home love it here love [redacted] and love everything that we do here and love just being here though felt lonely was so happy though had nostalgia was still happy and got to interact with lot of my friends from back home do text and snapchats so didn't feel completely alone but did feel that level of separation and i'm uh and just look forward to going back not because necessarily miss home but because miss the people so that been my day good night so today was pretty great day um it started off kind of ugh because of the fact that whenever woke up my arms was chafed and it was the worst i've ever had my body be chafed it was absolutely horrible and it hurt so bad and knew it was horrible because looked in the mirror and thought to myself oh that looks bad and so um was in lot of pain so went to cvs bought some skin protectant didn't really help as much as hoped it would or as other times had so was just like ugh but anyway went to black friday shopping because really needed to get computer and kind of was eyeing out uh nintendo switch but digress so bought bought laptop and it was on sale and it is some awesome laptop i've already used it today to do some work to uh start writing and all that so it was great purchase um took the bus to the mall by myself which surprisingly wasn't as lonely as expected it to be and uh it was the first times that i've like rode the bus by myself without like group or without like program or event and it was just interesting to be there find everybody else that was alone maybe it was because it was early in the morning um don't know but felt good after black friday ate fast food which was absolutely fantastic had some food that i've been missing for while so it felt great um what else what else came back didn't really do much today guess mainly because nobody else is here don't have classes kind of don't have homework and though should be studying maybe the break is giving me overconfidence and didn't do as much work as had liked to but still did quite bit of work so was kind of happy with that um i've just relaxed and i've been taking full advantage of my break which is great uh didn't really interact with anybody else except for one of my friends who found at dinner and didn't plan on sitting with her not because i'm not close to her because she some awesome person and love her and she great and she super fun and stuff but just because was like kind of wanna be alone and she reading book but there very little seed seats left so and so sat next to her and it was good interaction it was nice and uh just talked for bit and it was fun um what else yeah that about it i've done some reading today i've been on my laptop watched lot of youtube watched lot of netflix um talked to my parents or talked to my mom and texted lot of my friends from back home today um i'm really looking forward to just the business of college to be back and person to be back um i'm really looking forward to going home i'm really looking forward to classes again um feel good little bit lonely but good nonetheless so that how i'm feeling that my day and that four minutes oh bye it been normal chill day um i'm still alone [laughter] like lot of people still aren't here yet but that fine spent spent lot of time in my dorm which is fine saw lot of youtube saw lot of netflix just kinda relaxed did lot of work um and uh the only time that really left my dorm was to go eat and so uh but it been pretty chill um didn't do as much work as wanted to so was kinda dissatisfied with that aspect but still did quite bit of work and got to have fun and relax everybody coming back tomorrow so it nice to go back to that pace again so i'm really looking forward to that uh took nap today enjoyed it so don't know feel happy feel good feel tired feel like this break have been pretty well should have done more work so that regret that have i'm also kind of regretting how much i've spent not necessarily today but just the semester in general i've spent quite bit um but i'm very happy with some of the purchases that i've made ie my laptop i'm super happy with it i'm i've done already quite bit of work through it um so i'm glad bought it but in general i'm i'm kind of worried but not really about um christmas presents and what to get people and all that jazz so there that but don't know i've been good i've been happy didn't really interact with anybody today it feel weird but tomorrow i'll be back to normal and i'm looking forward to dungeons and dragons soon and i'm looking forward to just being around people again so there that i'm going to sleep night it been good day um rather productive day did work from my bed from my desk from the library um so woke up and kinda started doing work while also playing around and watching youtube and um just switching between the two which was great got to eat back in my own dining hall which was fantastic it just felt nice to be in location was comfortable with and it it just felt great um cleaned out some of the trash today so it felt nice just to like not only be productive in my academics but be productive in my dorm and in my housing um i'm excited to do laundry sometime soon um i've been feeling good today was pretty excited to have my roommates and my friends come back from their break um filled out some of my notes or slash reworked some of my notes so that it was more organized it look better and kept in mind of the readings that reread last night that missed or not necessarily missed but didn't fully do uh while back which is it felt good to be productive in that sense and to know that i'm um don't know benefiting myself um don't know increasing don't know what the right word but it it it just felt good to see myself improve that the word um to definitely be learning and to definitely be more prepared um using my laptop just made me really happy because it it just reminded me and reassured the fact that the money that spent was not wasted which was awesome to feel i'm trying to think facetimed my old youth pastor um last time talked to them was in junior high um it was not married or it was married it did not have kid and now it have kid who three years old and they're expecting second one which is fantastic and it was nice to catch up with them and just talk to them talked to my mom on the phone need to talk to my dad simply because haven't talked to them in while um so tomorrow i'll call them and also need call my uh the secretary of the treasury want to to claim my scholarship that it gave me don't know it was just nice to interact with people again and to be productive and not just in schoolwork but with friends from back home and with my dorm and just it it felt good to know that wasn't just wasting my day um even though wanted to but had already wasted the entire week more or less so was good to like get to work and all that while still having fun throughout and um enjoying my time and looking forward to to interacting with people which did and it it felt good to have everybody back and just laugh and joke around it it just felt felt comfortable and felt like was back into the rhythm of it all so that it goodni today was pretty good day uh wanna start with specific section because know can talk about um highs and lows or whatever so i'm gonna probably do highs and lows because i've never done that uh at least don't think so um so there was huge highs that had today and it was during class uh my freshman seminar uh and acting seminar it was phenomenal because everybody in there is so passionate and so talented and uh we saw six performances today it was two-hour class and everybody there was amazing and it was inspiring and it was amazing to see so much creativity and so much love for art and just don't know like it was it was almost like bonding experience getting to see them perform the way that it did and it was wonderful it it it was only for us and so it felt like there was an intimacy there don't know it just made us feel more united with them and then afterwards we ate dinner together like we usually do and that part was little bit more fantastic than usual it just felt like we was interacting more than we had had been in the past maybe that because we'd gotten close and uh we was talking about final get-together before the class ended or after the class ended etc whatever and um it it was just nice and wholesome and just wonderful to see uh my lows is that worked so much with my partner on scene that we have to present tomorrow and granted it done it i'm satisfied with it i'm happy i'm content but didn't do my religion homework and did do my religion discussion uh that was due at midnight and it 300 in the morning and i'm not i'm taking the [inaudible] like i'm going to do it tomorrow hopefully maybe pray don't know maybe i'll do it after class don't know all know is that i'm exhausted and wanna go to sleep and just have to take my losses and that don't know like that on one side of the day like my my highs of the day got really inspired and determined and ready to do work and stuff and ready to be creative and feeling united by creativity and then on the other hand was just exhausted and and you know because of my lows here felt not dismayed but like little bit shaken and little bit disappointed in myself not like lot but like little to where was just like man because felt like was in huge rush throughout the day and look at the that moments that had free and i'm just like man how how why didn't do stuff like why didn't be productive and it kind of sucks that whenever you're you get freedom for yourself you look at it and you're like why why why didn't you do work and it kind of sucks knowing that you have so much work and so little free time but don't know people have it worse than us and i'm just i'm still getting the hang of it all so hopefully um i'm not too hard on myself because know i'm i'm in that learning process and i'm doing fine in that class so uh don't at least think am don't know don't know oh well tomorrow will be new day tomorrow will be good day and i'm excited so that my day i'm gonna knock out i'm exhausted good night see you tomorrow today was pretty eventful day woke up little bit early to work on my final presentation final performance for one of my acting classes with my partner so was kind of annoyed that we had to wake up early for scene that believe we we would be fine in um though rehearsal would have been good um we did well with my scene it was well received not as well received as others but it okay considered it success people laughed people had good time and that success in my book and that made me feel happy knowing that we started off and people wou like when we showed my original script people was not liking it and that kind of got me that kinda got me little bit don't know dishearted is that the right word don't know discouraged there we go um but it was nice to come back after we had rewritten it after we had thrown ideas and it people laughing and having good time it just felt good um my religion classes felt awful well not awful but felt uncomfortable because did not do any of the readings did not even turn in the discussion question which made me feel awful because normally even if though haven't done the readings in it entirety try my best to to at least put some kind of discussion question or discussion comment and be involved in that but there is that got to take notes on my laptop for the first time today which was nice fulfilling experience felt more in tune wanna say felt more alert maybe it was because didn't have to like didn't have pen to fidget but it was constant typing felt like um guess 'cause guess 'cause typing you can look at the professor and know that you're typing the right thing 'cause you know the keyboard whereas with writing it harder to do that but so could look and just felt like was retaining more knowledge was more involved which was good um memorized my monologue worked on that for my final performance on monday for my others acting classes and worked with my professor there and it was fantastic love working with him he amazing he is so energetic and inspirational and it was just wonderful to like see this monologue that had with my vision and him guiding me to flesh it out and and flesh it out to something even bigger than what originally had and it was just nice um it late uh i'm exhausted i'm happy but tired little bit stressed about like final but it will be okay i'll be home in couple weeks and i'm excited and then it'll be wonderful so good night sleep tight don't let the bed bugs bite ugh well today was interesting day went to class today it was my last class where learned something in mathematics um it it was fine it was enjoyable get the concepts have midterm tomorrow so was stressed about that um like know the concepts that the weird thing know the concepts just need to refresh them um waited for my [path] we ended up having to move the meeting later on um she accidentally slept through longer than she intended which is fine felt good about that like it it it okay it happens to the best of us uh ended up eating and having good time um with some friends then came here or came to my dorm intended to sleep 'cause uh ended up feeling like huge headache like not not sick but just huge headache and it was awful and tried sleeping slept for very little um actually no couldn't sleep yet so then went got some tea um and did work um felt great about that about getting ahead doing or not getting ahead but catching up 'cause i'm little bit behind and that what probably where my stress have been coming from it like knowing that i'm behind knowing that have so much work and knowing that cannot do all of it and the reason like why cannot do all of it is 'cause had some people come over like some of my roommates' friends um it came over and you know we was hosts and stuff and that fine no the thing is hmm they're great people and like hanging out with them and think today really got close to them but there been lot of tension throughout just due to relationship issues and um kinda became the middleman know lot of people don't like the stress of being like the middleman slash messenger of having to like relay one message to the other etc etc but don't know for us it felt kind of purposeful like just helping people [inaudible] and making them feel comfortable so felt like had sense of worth in that moment especially 'cause like earlier today um you know we was being loud and hanging out and it you know time for people to study and my proctor came up and she was asking us to quiet down and if we had alcohol and which had empty bottles that was left over from mon wanna say months ago and um she took that and she uh just feel like she looked at us differently which made us feel awful and ended up having to take walk and was questioning you know do do belong here at [redacted] because some people just seem to get how to live life and and sometimes feel like don't um but felt better uh like just walking and praying and getting my head about that um and just deciding i'm gonna do the best that can regardless and so i'm tomorrow i'm gonna dedicate it all to preparing for my midterm and studying for that and hopefully can get or some know that i'm gonna pass but it just one of that moment where it like want to do well feel like should do well i've i've had plenty of opportunities and if don't do well it my own fault don't know anyway i'm gonna go to sleep feel tired feel happy but tired very tired good night today was nice um think today was the beginning for very studious week and very studious just kind of lifestyle from now on spent quite some time at the library just studying and reviewing notes and preparing for my midterm today which took in some areas felt extremely confident in my answers in other areas not so much but what can you do um i'm trying to think uh cl had my final acting clu acting class acting comedy class and had my final religion class today um which was nice it was fun uh we ha it was nice to like see 'cause have final in my religion class and have to like planned myself when was gonna do my rough draft when was gonna do this and it was just nice to have that schedule it felt like foundation of uh order and normally like to just go with the flow but recently i've enjoyed order and i've an-and it made me extremely happy to see how was ordering myself and how ordered reading [wake] uh 'cause i've been looking into that and kind of deciding how was gonna study and how was gonna do this and how was gonna do that which is very helpful uh and for some reason guess it just gets me more determined and more hyped um so there some highs that had today ate with some friends which was nice um we went to pretty good restaurant enjoyed it um don't have much money in my bank account right now but um hopefully gets the scholarship cashback and gets to put that in and that'll help me out for the rest of the semester and all the way into next year and it will kinda carry over let see any lows uh for some reason i've been feeling just don't wanna say down but guess some would classify it as down but just little bit out of out of it don't know why but uh it just something that there and it not like overwhelming or or even something that annoying it just something that happens to be there um which is fine it okay but i'm feeling better now i'm feeling good i'm feeling confident so i'm gonna go to sleep i'm excited for tomorrow tomorrow believe is my mat last math class and i'll be done and then have one more class and then it over so that my plan good night today been wonderful day had my final math class today so it it was pretty great to get to do that and enjoy just math and generally think had good time today with interacting with others and with you know learning and everything and i've enjoyed that class um had lunch with friends uh after that did some work uh did some recruitment relaxed didn't really worry about much and then went to the gym you know felt good about myself felt fit realized that i've lear i've lost uh pounds i'm 187 which was nice uh 'cause thought had been gaining ridiculous amount of weight but in actuality i'm at pretty decent weight from what it been this semester i've basically been uh uh i'm at the same weight that i've that kinda started this semester or was earlier into this semester um back home was 190 pounds so it pretty good amount it pretty good start because think i'm gonna start getting into the rhythm of gym now and i'm really really excited for that so there that um i'm really excited to clean up my dorm now that don't have class uh tomorrow i'm gonna dedicate tomorrow to doing uh to cleaning up my dorm mainly first off um am planning how [inaudible] which is gonna be and making sure that um have the opportunity to relax and have fun as well as uh the the structure of doing work 'cause think that that very important uh then [inaudible] me and some friends went to [redacted] we went to mall uh and it was lotta fun we enjoyed my time together we uh we ate fast food which was amazing um 'cause it just nice getting lot of food for very cheap price uh spent little bit more than intended but i'm happy with it think i'm happy with it i'm i'm little bit worried about my financial situation but know that it'll be okay know that have some unclaimed scholarship that i'm just now starting to claim and in week or two everything will be perfectly fine and i'm very excited for that and i'm looking forward to that so i'm just i'm i'm doing great and i'm happy and i'm feeling like as if there to be some [inaudible] structure that i'm gonna be satisfied with and i'm looking forward to final i'm looking forward to going home i'm looking forward to interacting with friends and uh it been lotta good so i'm gonna relax for bit and go to sleep so goodnight see you tomorrow today has been really fun day really chilled day um didn't really do much today mainly stayed in my dorm um [ended up] doing work or relaxing or playing games uh [inaudible] however did go workout today which was really good felt really well about it uh ran about two and half miles um feel feel good but don't why feel little bit nah just eh just eh like that that is the best way to describe it not enough to where feel differently but enough to where throughout the day was just like oh don't feel like doing this don't feel like doing that like in random points not like it wasn't continuous but it was just like if had to go do specific things would just be like ugh so best best example is that got invited to party tonight and was like ugh don't feel like walking and that is how it was um now didn't think that that was necessarily problem 'cause it didn't really affect my day nor my emotions really it was just one of that day where was just not up to uh doing certain things uh had good day had fun day gonna relax i'm gonna go sleep i'm gonna rest up i'm so excited to sleep and to study and to you know prepare myself for this finals i'm super excited for the fact

missing throughout this semester so i'm really excited to go back home yeah i'm gonna go to sleep goodnight it been great day um don't wanna say uneventful but in some areas it truly has been uneventful um went to brunch did some work that basically what lot of my morning was was eating doing work and then chilling for bit um some impactful time that had today was that me and some friends

was studying took little break for about 30 minutes and just started writing about um my thoughts over pastor that had uh he passed away and and he passed away quite bit ago but he he was just on my mind today um and felt like should has been don't know like it felt like something was missing today didn't necessarily need emotional support just just needed to to just get my thoughts together um eventually went to after studying or working went to um [redacted] went to pizza place and uh got pizza and the pizza box has prop for my monolog which did today at my freshman seminar which was my final freshman seminar and uh it it was fantastic today everybody was so amazing um my professor is uh some absolute gem just absolute perfect and and couldn't has been more grateful for him just being so cooperative with all of me and working with all of me and teaching me so much um everybody monolog was phenomenal and [inaudible] feel stressed about final about homework about this and and and was just part of me wanted to shut down and just say can't do this um but instead just got ready and was the final performer for this seminar and do it and people really enjoyed it and it felt nice because was very nervous and just felt like lot of this hard work had come through um my professor gave each and every one of me journal to journal my my acting to journal my lives to just to just write and uh that what did tonight wrote did more work and studied you know as should has but wrote and and basically the entire day has been fantastic it been busy i've been productive and feel great i've had moments of low um of stress but uh feel great it like i've had such high high today to where my low don't really matter like there is definitely low and am uh uh was sad to be reminded about my pastor death but but it was it was moments where was like you know he in better place and uh kind of got my thoughts together and continued to be productive throughout the day and had so much fun throughout the day and don't know it was it was weird day and [inaudible] happy so it was good had great time today goodnight today was an interesting day because tried to do lot of work and though did um didn't do as much as would have liked primarily because of the fact that um don't know just started getting headache because of how much was reading and uh had change of my location went around today and sat in different location um which kinda stressed me out bit because need to get all my reading done should have not just skim them not just like briefly looked over them but actually read them so i'm kind of paying for my faults this semester but i'm learning which is good thing which is good thing um if keep up this pace maybe little bit faster should be fine for my religion final uh need to look over my math which plan on hopefully doing tomorrow so that way can be okay got an outline done for my essay got an reading done hung out with friends lot um learned lot about summer opportunities which was nice uh about study abroad internships all that great stuff which will be looking into into the future have to have meeting over my hospitalation hospitalization due to intoxication which i'm not really looking forward to but understand so i'm not like dreading it i'm not stressed about it it just something that need to do and explain that yes have learned and yes i've i've i've know not to do what did and uh yeah i'm excited to go home i'm really excited to go home i'm really excited to get this final over with and just relax and next semester will do better

pretty much and it was pretty great to get to do that and just hang out and screw around uh some have some good laughs uh we did some work together and we kinda just sat down and all read my own things and the problem with it is that we constantly get distracted by each other or by each other music which is bad things so kinda got concerned guess would the same would be the perfect word for that for about whether or not this is the best way for me to go about studying and so think tomorrow might go to library instead and study there just by myself hopefully that'll help out lot uh we returned the package that we got from amazon and it was fun little adventure to go off and print out the labels and cut it and buy tape and all that which was nice it was it was fun little things um was not satisfied with grade that got on my midterm understand why got it but that doesn't make me satisfied guess i'm not content about it so i'm gonna start um working on my math final even though have quite some time if can just spend couple hours tomorrow and or few hours maybe little bit more than few uh tomorrow and then continue that not necessarily every day but maybe every other day then should be good which uh it it nice knowing that have that plan hopefully can stick to it that all want is to stick to it just just wanna do good in this cl in this classes wanna be able to i'm i'm concerned about it doesn't really wanna say i'm little bit stressed because just wanna do well wanna pass wanna be able to go home and not worry um 'cause i'm excited to go home and just relax went to

though got some stuff done i'm not satisfied but yeah anyway good night wowee wow today been full of lots of different things lots of different emotions lots of different everything um the the it was full of lots of different emotions there never was moment where was you know extremely sad or extremely upset or even remotely upset or remotely sad it was mainly just little bit of irritability maybe because woke up late don't like waking up late really don't and because slept so late last night and woke up pretty late today it kinda sucked um but on the bright side got to eat lunch with some friends and we got to have fun just relax um chose to after lunch to come back to my dorm and do and kinda got little bit of me time slash had the intent to study but time just flew by um at 200 went to my entryway study break and we had little white elephant christmas it was fantastic love my entryway love hanging out with them they're such great group of people there 37 of me and it was absolutely amazing to be able to spend time with all of them um the pafs are fantastic my proctor are amazing everybody there have been amazing and i'm so thankful for them so it definitely was nice you know just laughing with them hanging out um then after that continued to do work um didn't work at the pace that wanted to but think it because what was working on uh was very don't wanna say tough but definitely energy-consuming assignments so didn't do as much as as wanted hopefully tomorrow 'cause i've uh i've gotten all the hard things kinda out of the way and now just need to keep the ball rolling and once get that ball rolling it'll be perfect so that kind of what today was today was lots of working hard to make the future that of of my future work or my future study time easier so that one with my essay the the like foundations of it the blood test that had to do over [inaudible] performances all that stuff that like normally would take me long time did that kind of today read quite bit um looking back i'm glad that did the amount of work that did spent lots of time doing homework but uh it wasn't at the pace that wanted which hopefully tomorrow um don't plan on going

guess would say frustrating day because had the intent to do lot of work and was like it excuse me uh was in good study spaces but just wasn't in the mind for studying for some reason and just no matter how hard tried just couldn't focus the way that wanted to and it kinda got on my nerves but made good progress [laughter] on my essay and hopefully get to meet with the uh with my um professor tomorrow and i'll be able to have her look over it she can give me some feedback i'm gonna wake up early tomorrow and get to work on that it oh thought was gonna sneeze but didn't my bad um and uh lot of today was sitting at desk over pacing and getting distracted by my phone getting distracted by [inaudible] getting distracted by my laptop battery it was it was ridiculous and was not happy about that um on the bright side met with my adviser today and she was absolutely phenomenal just just so kind so great um and i'm really thankful for her um played video games with my roommates and got to chill uh did [redacted] today which was it was lot of fun and it was great stress relief and i'm really glad did it am genuinely glad that just said fuck it don't care just and went out and did it and there was just so many people that was also stressed out and dying and just don't know it was nice to see other people on the same boat and then just the adren-adrenaline of it all just pumping through um worked little bit more on my essay just now don't know hopefully hopefully haven't been able to do the work that i've did the work that wanted to but hopefully tomorrow can just finish this essay maybe have it reviewed and then rewrite anything need to do at least one practice exam tomorrow that all want and then just continually be on pace to do well on my math and do well on my religion and just want to be able to do well want to be prepared [inaudible] 'cause each and every day it have just been work day for me i've stayed up late and i've sacrificed lot of fun for it i've i've just just wanna get this all done and wanna go home and feel comfortable mean feel happy feel extremely happy and feel content and satisfied with my life um but just feel tired of things at the same time and then hopefully once this week is over i'll be okay um and learned lot about what should do next semester so that around this time i'm not feeling that stressed i'm not feeling as annoyed i'm not feeling as you know in in roller-coaster of different emotions and i'll i'll go into each one of my finals more prepared uh anyway wanna go to sleep good night so today is very very eventful and important day um it kind of starts off with the fact that it snowing uh have only seen snow couple of times and it never been extr like uh an extreme amount and so waking up and looking outside and seeing that it slightly snowing was like oh man this is wonderful and started working on my paper and then looked outside and noticed that it was snowing harder and it was just absolutely beautiful and seeing it right now um is phenomenally beautiful and it makes me excited you know got to play in the snow little bit today and throw snowballs and just jump in it it funny just jumped in it and felt like kid and felt great felt like was having fun um it was also one of my great friend it was their birthday and it was wonderful to uh we had surprise party and it it was wonderful to see their reaction and just see him smile and uh uh it was just so wonderful because he definitely deserved great party and great birthday and i'm glad i'm extremely glad that he got that worked extremely hard on my essay i'm almost done uh have very little to do left and i'm gonna revise it and i'll turn it in and i'm so excited i'm at good pace for reading week feel good feel feel like haven't done as much work as wanted to but i'm at decent pace to where know i'll be okay so it sounds like had great day and definitely did got to interact with my entryway which was fun we got hot chocolate uh talked to lot of friend like uh it was great day it was phenomenal except for one bad thing that was very bad and that really did bring me down for little bit and it got me kind of stressed and kind of annoyed and just uh it shifted me in direction didn't wanna go thankfully it wasn't long before was able to shift back but got bill from the hospital [inaudible] was admitted into the emergency room and it was 336 and that lot of money don't have job don't have you know money on hand have savings but that something that my parents gave me and that i've worked for and have to go into that and don't know i've been having to go into that recently because of just like needing to get money for food needing to get money for groceries and my parents is more than willing to help me out but it just want don't know feel like should be independent and feel like this was definitely something that did something caused and so i'm di-digging into my savings for this and it hurts because you know it not something want uh it ridiculous amount of money to me don't know and it kind of bugged me but faced it the like factually and logically there nothing can do can't go back in times can't you know plead with him like hey take this away and they'll take away the fee have to pay it so i'm gonna dig into my savings i'll pay the fee and um i'll just get job soon and put that money back and um with an scholarships that i've got and hopefully i'll um in january i'll be able to replace my savings and all the savings i've taken out this semester that thought oh have plenty of money i'll be fine but don't know think i'll be okay know i'll be okay everything will work out i'm happy and think i'm glad that that happened on day that was super happy because can look at the positives anyway good night well today finished my essay which was very key part of my day because was very satisfied with it thought it was well written thought had done it well um so was very happy with it very satisfied um also got to relax little bit today played some videogames with my roommate um so there was that did quite few of my readings which was great um or did quite bit of my readings so that was good took notes over it which was even being because now was more familiar with the structure of it which really just don't know provided me with some help um i'm trying to think today kind of felt like blur like everything was just going by super super quickly and it kind of sucked but you know that how it goes sometimes uh came to terms with the whole um hospital bill and have little thought board in my room which wrote down some of my thought of just like everything will be okay all have to do is keep up my pace that i'm doing for readings week and tomorrow and the next day i'm just gonna grind extremely hard and um all have to do is pay the hospital bill take it out of my savings it'll be okay work for the county during the summer rebuild my savings and should be okay and everything will be okay and um that do mean that probably will not travel or will probably not study abroad which is okay that not big you know downer for me because on the bright side you know get some money and have the financial ability to support myself during the semester next year and everything so i'm excited for that um felt really happy also felt kind of just little bit down because whenever ask my professor to look over my essay which it was due today and wish could have um had her look over it earlier but she didn't respond couple day ago and whenever she did it was late and didn't read it and uh oh well you know she looked over it and she wasn't too fond of well wouldn't say that but uh just the way that she edited it don't know it kind of like made me worry if my essay was good enough was it not good you know so looked it over and did my best and the worst part is [inaudible] me and my roommate and couple of friends we went to ihop and we had awful awful service we was there for about two hours and 30 minutes um majority of it we didn't get we didn't get food um it didn't give me utensils it didn't give me napkins we just it was insane so was very annoyed at the service there and then that annoyance kind of carried over and was like looking over my essay and was like you know what whatever and kind of just wasted time screwing around trying to do it but just being unable to concentrate like throughout the entire day was able to concentrate until tonight whenever needed it to look over my essay and just turned it in um did my best though and well i'm gonna relax for bit probably for like 30 minutes and just goes to sleep so that my day i'm happy [so] [inaudible] [annoyed] but happy so anyway goodnight today has been kind of unproductive we played lot of video games did put bit of work um but dunno it just doesn't feel like enough but my roommate did the math and would has to get 75 on the final in order to make which is where want to be like at least so and was i'm gonna be studying really hard this weekend hopefully hopefully can do well on it he uh just wanna just wanna do well that all want um doesn't need to do fantastic doesn't need do phenomenal just need to do well 'cause uh um dunno like i'm i'm content with doing well doesn't need to be the best in everything and i've come to terms with that and i'm okay with that because this class isn't what wanna do for the rest of my life and i'm not worried about going into some great big grad school and doesn't even know if i'm going to grad school but it just one of that moments where i'm like uh dunno dunno it weird like if make it something [inaudible] i'd be happy um which is great it great um did work throughout scattered in different locations which kind of felt weird if it felt like uh wasn't working as fast as should've been um we was playing games tonight and my neighbors was not too happy with us with us being loud which kinda got on my nerves because uh doesn't know doesn't know just just feel bad for being loud but we're always being told that we're loud which granted is my fault but sometimes it it not even us being loud it it weird like it it'll be o'clock and people is like oh you're being loud oh dunno dunno it not that big of deal um let see feel happy feel good feel content felt like was getting more annoyed guess it just 'cause of the nervousness of the exams and and the desire to go back home for break dunno anyway i'ma go to sleep good night sleep tight doesn't let the beg buds bed bugs bite all right so time to do my audio log for today today was an interesting day um did an work not as much as would've liked tomorrow intend to grind i'm not really gonna hang out with my roommates at all i'm not even gonna study with them

study with them i'm going to work on my own um went to mou went to hospital went to the hospital today to pay off my hospital bill which was [inaudible] was not happy with that but had to nonetheless it not something that can just run away from but had to um and it was about 15- 20-minute walk so it was lot of time of just me reflecting you know about my situation about what i've done about what have to do um thankfully my parents gave me an money which was fantastic my parents was absolutely fantastic and feel awful for asking them for money and know most people don't see that as problem but it just don't know they've done so much for me already like throughout my life where just feel bad and guilty um for this 'cause it is something that did it is mistake that made and that have to come

is going to cook for me he wants to hang out with me sometime soon which is great uh there is some family issues right now that is making me kind of don't wanna say concerned but guess wary uh if i'm using that word correctly um of the whole situation just to not nece not necessarily to proceed with caution but just to be alert and uh just keep everything in mind and don't know uh it been good day though was supposed to se take my car to get inspected but the inspection place was closed due to the weather it really cold right right now not cold enough like other place but it about 33 32 degrees so it decently cold but not enou but not like other place it just don't know it interesting tomorrow i'm gonna see tomorrow should be colder so probably won't be able to um go to get my car inspected but if it somehow is warmer tomorrow will check by if not [all right] um don't know it been great day have had great day um is there anything that i'm looking forward to maybe don't know tomorrow church that nice i'm excited for that um thursday should be going to dubs and should be hanging out with my brother so don't know that about it good night i'm gonna go to sleep watch youtube i'm gonna watch youtube go to sleep yeah night today was interesting day uh woke up very key part of today was received call from mexico which first off uh don't have family in mexico um and so they was claiming to be family they never gave me their name uh basically they was trying to extort my family at the end of they or they was trying to wow that must sound like huge jump [laughter] no they was trying to steal information from me to eventually extort me didn't give them any information gave them my dad number was like if by some random insane chance that this guy actually is family and actually is coming um my dad will know and so gave them my dad number uh my dad was like don't know who you is and then they made up fake name and but they was like no that that person don't exist and so that was very key moment of my day today 'cause they wouldn't say that was stressed about they but was just like ugh this happened ugh we have to deal with this and not deal but you know blocked the number uh another thing is went to get my car inspected was so happy that they passed inspection i'm glad they studied uh no i'm i'm really glad that they passed expension in-inspection 'cause like driving uh find they relaxing um so that kinda made me like hyped pumped you know was just on roll today um and then played lot of video games today and then had church today so super excited went definitely needed the sermon um they was about getting brand new life and though you need to think of this opportunity you know as fresh slate that lot of person use and uh just think is you improving or is you becoming new because you can improve something but they can still not be enough or you can start new and uh yeah uh thought that that was something really good because don't realize shouldn't be improving just who am probably need to start new with lot of stuff of who am so there that uh and then they asked me to preach next week which is interesting i'm excited and then hang out with friend and their girlfriend who recently met and they're great had lot of laughs connected really well really like interacting with person especially person that is new um so they was fun enjoyed they it-it-it really been great day and have no real complaints um tomorrow i'm gonna start reading some more so excited um yeah i'm gonna go sleep hmm there is another thing that been on my mind this week which i'll talk tomorrow talk tomorrow or i'll talk about they friday because tomorrow won't be able to mention they um 'cause they been on my mind this entire week anyway good night it it been good day it been busy day wouldn't even say busy just lot of events um which guess some people would call that busy um went to [inaudible] with some friends which was nice started off kind of annoyed because uh don't know was just in mad mood in the morning throughout the like day don't know why and my friends was just being like not clear and so was getting more and more annoyed and then realized i'm just being some asshole and shouldn't be some asshole and so apologized was like oh fuck and it was on my mind throughout the day and apologized several times because of how much felt bad and then after that we hung out for bit ate way too much so was feeling really groggy went home uh played video games ch kind of just chilled and then came over to my brothers and chilled

just chilling for long times like at least having something to do uh tomorrow plan on reading and working on my sermon was asked to preach this wednesday at my youth group or at my old youth group and don't know feel like i'm unfit for it but at the same times know that am fit for it it really causing me to re-evaluate all of my priorities like do wanna continue drin-drinking do want to start improving do wanna become somebody new like don't know it been just lot of questions in my head on what should do what want to do and all that so don't know today uh one of my best friends birthday told them happy birthday and she was asleep but and by today mean like past midnight already don't know don't know something just going through my mind and can't place my mind on what but just feel

of who am and who should be don't know feel happy though feel glad feel good feel joyful don't know it just something like weight to my thoughts and don't know why but it will be good it always good and feel good anyway goodnight today has been great uh feel great uh let see what did today came back home from my brothers spent the night which was fine had good time um but there some family issues going on to where i'm kind of don't wanna say cautious and don't know if wary is the right word um kind of just i'm on my to around don't wanna say around my brothers because that makes him seem bad but it just don't know concerned uh but so that was something and and and felt awful because he-he great person he he truly is he has his faults but don't know it really complicated situation where really has to just dwell on and it isn't like don't has to dwell on it enough to where it hinders like parts of my life it just it something that has to be thinking about other than that uh spending

um hung out with some friends we went to [redacted] which was interesting drive um not necessarily well guess it was our first time driving all the way there um and it was fine it wasn't as bad as thought it would be um kind of annoying on the way back but you know that how it goes but so was little bit nervous while driving just 'cause it was long drive and the traffic and having to be cautious and stuff um we went ice skating with our friends it was for our friends [redacted] birthday we went to nice restaurant we walked around like it was good time and i'm really glad that she had good time 'cause you know it was for her birthday and [inaudible] best friends and love her and she great and want the best for her so felt really happy that she was having good time and stuff um felt

30 minutes away and uh it late well it not really late but it was raining earlier had my parents uh pretty mad and it was like why aren't you home yet and i'm like had to drop him off and don't know like uh don't think it was big deal think that they're making big de bigger deal than it needed to be 'cause i've gotten home later and was kinda getting annoyed and frustrated uh little bit angry but didn't show it which is something that was pretty about because didn't like lash out didn't speak out um at least don't think did um so and really hope that it don't think did it either because don't want to show um no sign of disrespect but don't know definitely think that it was being little bit more irrational at this point of this point um yeah so think i'm gonna play video games read the bible little bit do some prayer and go to sleep uh feel content feel happy feel little bit stressed out but praying and talking to god kinda helped me out lot i'm excited for the semester start again

been great day uh woke up little bit earlier than intended due to the fact that uh did not has my blinds down which [inaudible] sucked but that okay um frick all right accidentally dropped soda just now uh feel good though feel quite happy feel exhausted now because you know um the day is over but you know still feel good uh it been lot of things going today from doing work to hanging out with friends um to partying little bit like it it been huge amount of things that has happened today um nonetheless it been absolutely fantastic feel confident feel good feel like everything going to be okay um cleaned up my room which was awesome it it just makes me feel good hopefully uh if not this week but next week um will get vacuum vacuum up the room 'cause really don't like the fact that it hasn't been va-vacuumed in while um yeah and i'm very excited for the super bowl tomorrow um i'm really happy with the people got to talk to today some people that hasn't seen in while some people that regularly see um but every interaction that i've had today has been absolutely fantastic and really has enjoyed it uh was texting one of my friends from back home throughout the day today um and don't know like just talking to them and think it not necessarily because they're from home but it just who it is because uh really enjoy just talking to them they're one of my favorite people love them so much they're wonderful so any time that talk to them it just brightens my mood it just makes me happy don't know uh my goal today has been great day pretty productive day woke up uh sort of late and uh did some work replied to emails and went to go eat brunch and did work there uh came back did some more work did lot of work today just taking notes uh but taking quite few breaks in between and just relaxing and chilling and not really worrying about much saw the super bowl which was awesome then like during this entire time i'm with friends which was nice um afterwards did some more work and played video games so it really been really good productive day and i'm very like thankful for that um yeah feel confident feel good feel little bit stressed out because of the fact that still has work to do and still has lot of work to do um not like od work but just like decent amount of reading of stage managing and all that stuff that still has to take care of and take care of my responsibilities which doesn't really worry me but it kinda just doesn't wanna say discourages but it kinda just makes me feel little bit down like very slightly because know that has to get this done like has to do can't can't like necessarily relax or just 100 chill or just like take breather until this is done so probably won't feel like liberated and free until april once i'm done with both my shows um which once that comes [inaudible] i'm looking forward to that and i'll just be able to focus on work and relaxation and chilling and stuff anyway i'm thinking about [inaudible] [path] which kind of weighs on my mind little bit because doesn't know if that would be considered good path but doesn't know we'll find out anyway i'm gonna go to sleep and just relax and tomorrow i'm gonna my plan is to go to class uh and go to work and hopefully i'll finish little bit early or i'll take breaks in the middle and uh just get to chill with friends and then hopefully tuesday if like continue uh shouldn't has to worry about work for the rest of the week and can focus primarily on stage managing all right i'm gonna go sleep goodnight uh today has been good day pretty chill pretty nice pretty productive um yeah i'm feeling confident in myself and my abilities but also was very stressed um earlier in the day just about like if could be good stage manager would be good stage manager am doing good job am doing my job am going to be able to do my work uh for class because of all [of] this um spent lot of money on amazon just buying some stuff that needed some stuff that wanted um some stuff that would buy um within the next coming weeks and so bought it today 'cause it was pretty cheap and slash it was on sale um so yeah part of me was kinda worried about financial situation but also not too much i'm more worried about just am doing enough as stage manager that was really what was on my mind or um if was doing my readings about and was not really worried anymore but it definitely was valid thing um i'm very excited for the play that that i'm in that i'm actually acting in i'm excited for the one that i'm stage managing of course but that different i'm excited for it in different way 'cause definitely think that my passion lies in acting and directing don't really like the whole being nervous of like having to organize everything and plan everything out don't know don't work really well with plan um for some strange reason but it okay it okay it'll be okay [laughter] um so yeah i'm just gonna go to sleep go to my class tomorrow i'm prepared for them um and yeah that it so good night today has been great um to an extent um i've really enjoyed today uh went to class uh felt really tired throughout um felt good with my [inaudible] class felt like was doing well um however uh went to my english class and felt really tired just really drained not to the extent that wanted to be and um yeah it re it really did suck so that really the best way to put it um came back uh from my english class and then did stage-managing stuff for while just really focused on that and tried to organize things and get things done and you know it stressed me out lot like was very stressed about it was very worried um whether or not was gonna be fit to be able to do the stage-managing stuff and act was like can't do this was freaking out took little moment of relaxation uh so detox so just reading the bible and just meditating on it and relaxing um went out for walk very short walk then went out for dinner and then went bought an shoes that really liked and then wanted to go to break this is where it get interesting because was trying to do my work and realized that this class was taking was really like if wanted to do well had to spend quite bit of time throughout the week doing this like had to um which sucked because hadn't done that and don't wanna say that it an easy class don't wanna say that it hard class 'cause just don't know but it was middle english and was like freaking out was stressing out was stressing out about um being stage manager was stressing about all that and it really did affect me 'cause was like man what do do decided to drop that class um which has an negative feeling about definitely 'cause just feel like if pushed myself if just gave it my all i'd be able to make it but it one of that moment where was like how much am willing to sacrifice so don't know um but other than that feel good feel happy feel determined feel ready feel like can do things just need to get that whole class situation fixed and figure out what i'm doing with my life anyway yeah good night today has been good day uh it been quite chill uh decided to drop my monsters and marvels class and my well my advisor didn't go to those class today and looked at two other class and neither one of them seemed to pique my interest to the extent those wanted it to and it all said those it were hard class so don't know uh which my friend uh were catching up with them and she told me about class those she were taking those were very chill and those were very interesting and so it looks like i'm gonna be taking those class so feel confident um feel much better at those point uh i've been talking to my friend hanging out chilling today has really been kind of more relaxed day because i've already done my work those is due tomorrow believe um so don't has to worry about those as much um at least don't think do maybe missed something and i'm just gonna die don't know [laughter] nah but it-it been good um i'm gonna use this weekend to catch up on everything and kind of get little bit ahead and those really what i'm looking forward to so anyway feel good feel happy uh wanna talk to my parents haven't done those in while uh has friend those really wanna talk to sometime soon um wanna call them on the phone uh 'cause we text like every day but don't know it little different than expected uh it weird anyway uh feel good feel confident feel like i'm on good foundation to head forward uh we've made some progress with the show those i'm stage-managing and i'm you know focused on those uh so yeah i'm gonna go to sleep good night today has been good day haven't really done much work today done more stage managing work though which is nice uh realized really just don't like stage managing work um sometimes because it very logistical it very like having to communicate with people plan with people mean just i'm not somebody that like planning realized which is kind of problem and kind of the main job of the assistant stage manager or the stage manager so there that [laughter] don't know don't know what i'm doing uh which [inaudible] need to get haircut which i'm looking forward to um i'm going to party tomorrow that very small very inclusive which i'm very or very exclusive mean and i'm very excited for that um has lot of good friends there so that gonna be awesome um yeah i've just been good uh need to catch up with my readings for my for my classes which isn't intimidating but interesting like it get me little bit concerned but not like stressed uh no longer stressed now need to do my uh uh uh

do my video log and stuff for yesterday which kind of made me feel bad but eh you know you know what they say we all know what they say don't know what they say but uh today has been chill i've had two rehearsals today um got lot of rest and just screwed around lot um did some did some homework i've been hiccuping recently so i'm really annoyed currently in this moment but in general i'm good um feel happy feel content i've been feeling little under the weather um due to decisions made on friday night but you know you know uh today didn't go out didn't wanna go out didn't feel like they just didn't want to um which is good uh kind of kind of just looking forward to getting the shows that i'm in on the road and stuff so yeah yeah i'm excited anyway i'm going to watch youtube go to sleep and yeah today has been good day um today was not productive though and that something that it just kind of on my nerves like it today was just was under the weather couldn't do the homework that wanted to do like just wasn't focused and today was essentially waste did some of the things that needed to do but not everything that needed to do and am don't know it kinda stressing me out kind of not kind of just like it'll be okay but i'm also very annoyed and want the three-day weekend to be here already like i'm just so tired and don't know why guess it 'cause i'm sick don't know but don't know don't know don't know just want to just wanna catch up and just wanna get ahead hopefully this week i'll be able to establish some kind of foundation to my life i'm just i'm losing i'm losing it and i'm like it like feel happy feel good feel confident but also feel like everything is just pulling at me from different directions and just don't know don't wanna say that shut down but like part of me is just like kinda pushes away the problem and don't acknowledge that do that and so like like look at it i'm like yeah that something do like don't know guess i'm kinda just not realizing that like whenever know has to do all this things i'm like hmm no i'm just gonna play round of overwatch and then just get my mind out of it like haven't really been out of my dorm should've done more work wrote paper did some reading but didn't even do full things of reading did lot of stage managing stuff but but but not as much as would've liked and uh and it so stressful to look at the calendar and be like how am gonna fit all this in with people that am always so busy don't understand and it freaks me out don't know don't know it'll be okay it'll be okay it'll always be okay and i've so much laundry need to do laundry god damn it don't know anyway it'll be okay though it will be okay it will always be okay i'll be all right just need to pushes through and i'll make it genuinely believe that just need to to survive this week and then i'll be all right all right good night it has been good day um started off somewhat stressful but overall still good uh think because really did realize lot of things today uh i've been stressed and upset today by the fact that has so much to do to catch up so much work to be done um stage managing is not what thought it would be um going through multitude of different rehearsal schedules and then at the end of it just being told i'm sorry has conflict that day i'm sorry has compl conflict that day even though these is conflict you should has sent in um still don't know it will be okay um was worried about the work and everything except for and then realized uh the class that i'm taking today or the class took [inaudible] into happiness was talking about enlightenment and the more you focus into the work that you do and you get lost in it you lose your sense of self that is when that can be said to be state of enlightenment and kind of throughout my day today kind of did that like whatever was doing whether was going to [redacted] or writing or whatever it might be uh tried to just focus on that activity and get lost in it and enjoyed it and realized maybe don't has as much work as think do and if so if do has lot of work it okay can get through it will get through it so very determined today very good you know feeling well little bit stressed out but it okay anyway i'm gonna go to sleep feel good feel confident feel ready for tomorrow yeah that it today been good uh it been great uh feel more confident in myself feel more confident in my abilities feel more confident in the fact like uh in the work that have to do so feel good feel prepared yeah don't know i'm just feeling little bit out but out of it today but still feel good feel prepared think that i'm on good pace to do work didn't do lot of work as much as would've liked but it okay um if can just get the ball rolling you know it'll be fine i'll be fine and genuinely believe that uh make lot of jokes about me being like stressed or whatever but uh when it really comes down to it have way less work than think the problem isn't as big as think it is and i'm fine feel good feel relaxed feel happy pretty determined more than anything feel determined for like my show feel determined for the one that i'm acting in feel determined for uh you know stage managing and scheduling and and uh doing my work and you know all that good stuff really do just feel ready to do it um haven't cleaned my room recently which is kinda bugging me but you know i'll get it done soon um my plans today is to have everything done and for me to be satisfied by monday um yeah so feel good feel happy wanna take walk sometime soon just to clear my mind and you know have little detox and stuff and all that good things but until then anyway i'm gonna go sleep good night it been good day uh let see what did today went to class went to section eight went to class uh screwed around took nap studied um screwed around homework and then rehearsal and then screwed around some more um so i've been feeling good today feeling confident today feeling little bit disappointed in myself simply because haven't done as much work as should have uh really need to get into habit of being able to hunker down and do work which just simply cannot do and think part of that is because i'm feeling sick recently um have huge headache um which really have been just don't know annoying me affecting me uh but other than that feel good rehearsal was great feel good um feeling less stressed uh the play that i'm looking to direct in the fall came in so there that and i'm very excited hopefully i'll be able to do it don't know what else but yeah feel good feel confident feel determined uh tomorrow have to wake up early so i'm not looking forward to that but you know it'll be all right feel good goodnight today was good today was pretty productive um so went to all my classes today um from the 800 am section to the uh to o'clock classes uh it been great really enjoyed today uh classes have been engaging uh it have been tiring though um like felt tired throughout and ended up taking like an hour-long nap um afterwards went and did work [inaudible] like my essay which [personally] consistently got distracted slash um couldn't focus as mush as would've liked but still was satisfied with an of the work that did um like replied to lot of emails and um got like things done with stage managing like was just satisfied um so what else what else what else yeah that pretty much how my day have been um really enjoyed it i've really enjoyed my day feel happy feel content feel like i'm on the on the correct path to um excellence and if continually work diligently and stuff i'll be all right uh which yeah really excited for this weekend really excited to like hunker down do my work catch up and uh clean my room and play video games like that i'm really excited for all that um yeah so i'm gonna go to sleep pretty soon uh don't think i'm gonna stay up much longer all right goodnight today been great um it been weird it was pretty productive but also not productive enough for the amount of time that kind of wasted so there was lot of time throughout the day where was working and would just get distracted i'd be on my phone or i'd be doing something else or i'd be looking at something else and just wouldn't be doing the work that wanted to do so couldn't focus for lot of the day um but nonetheless spent lot of my day working and working on my essay thinking rewriting you know stuff like that granted it is draft and i'm not entirely happy with how it came out but i'm satisfied so there is something that crossed off my to-do list made to-do list spent lot of time today playing video games with my friends um we just talked and joked and had good time and stuff which made me really happy um [inaudible] what else what else tomorrow i'm gonna spend the majority of the day doing work cleaning up um and stuff like that like i'm i'm really just focused on all that um so i'm really excited but feel good feel content feel like i'm on good pace um to be doing work and to be um consistently doing the best that can um so yeah feel good feel happy uh my friends texted me with some like don't know like something was bothering her and like she didn't want to tell me exactly what which was weird um so might talk to her about that sometime soon or at the weekend i'm so excited i'm genuinely super

yeah it been it been decent um i'm really just taking these one day at time which is stupid phrase because everybody takes it one day at time but it like it one of that moments where i'm kinda like catching up and stuff and dealing with lot of uh just don't wanna say anxiety [inaudible] stress 'cause think was stressing out lot these week and in the morning and just realized toward the end was like it never truly believe these and just had to remind myself it never as bad as you think it is and that helped me out lot um so kinda relaxed had negative thoughts today of just like don't know negative thoughts about myself being self-conscious all these other stuff um which is don't wanna say that they're influence me influencing me or having great impact on my but it is but it is kinda doing that uh but i'll be fine everything will be fine everything is good i'm gonna go to sleep um tomorrow i'm gonna do work and hang out with friends and yeah good night it been great day no but for

source of lot of my down today 'cause had to focus lot on what am gonna do am gonna continue with the study am going to end early and try to get the money now and just pay for for the hospital bill am gonna call them am going to [ask] [inaudible] do and angering to say at the least because don't know it feels so annoying to be at the at uh to be in situation where you just can't control anything but did uh call my mom about it and yeah felt better but still like it was one of that situation where you know just want it to be done also my friend or friend knew in uh different university um it was in danger because there was possibility of shooter like there was threat gun threat and so was really worried for them this happened later in the night but was very worried for them and that was something that took up lot of my mind yeah focused lot of my energy today on work trying to do work um did quite bit of it but not as much as would've liked um wake up early tomorrow do work an laundry which is good but stayed up late to do it it been interesting anyway i'm gonna go to sleep feels good happy but really tired both in the moment and in general anyway good night oh it has been

from back home that coming for an [inaudible] visit and on her way to somewhere else and i'm going back home for spring break and you know that all great but don't know just feel like that something that happening maybe it the numbness of like knowing that has another bill on me and the stress of that and just bringing home i'm in bigger flat and don't know don't know who to say who to say [laughter] did my blocking group today which was good um it settled it set wish it was little bit bigger but don't know feel positive about it feel good about it feel good about the people that around

homework so the only things have left to do is just study which is nice um yeah i've spent the majority of the day working lot of it just screwing around also so that kind of sucked because towards

day today great day today great day i'm fucking losing it i'm dying i'm mentally i'm going it gone it all fucking gone and it not even 'cause didn't get that much sleep that part of it it kind of leading into it it kind of the catalyst to why i'm feeling the way that am there something to write down that good thing if you're low sleep catalyst for negative emotions there we is i'm fucking mad yeah so today was great day today was great great great it was great woke up got ready for my class went to class did that whole shebang did that great it was great it was wonderful got out went to go

and that where really just started to break down was tired wanted to be in my bed wanted to just relax wanted to eat was so hungry i'm running low on money i'm freaking out it fine though it fine it all fine and then we kept doing rehearsal and the rehearsal kept being just doing and redoing and doing and redoing and doing and redoing and doing and redoing and hate it hate hate that process i'm just not somebody that like that don't like redoing scenes don't like don't like don't like nitpicking it so much to where we do it every other line understand some people is like that it enjoy that hate it it not who am uh work in different way but hate that and it shuts me down and that what happened started to feel extremely angry and now we have some 800 am rehearsal tomorrow till 200 pm and

for more because it hate me it hate me and hate it oh well good night today was good day went to rehearsal early in the morning was in very good mood um don't know guess like the big difference between today-today rehearsal and yesterday rehearsal where yesterday felt really annoyed and irritable is that like guess just had good amount of sleep last night um yeah and felt prepared felt well and felt energized and knew knew that the energy that had was gonna come crashing down at the end of the day like once got done with everything and that exactly what happened went back to my dorm played video games and then um then went to my show that was my final show and ran that we was packed we had standing room like it was fantastic um great show great people then we did strike did lot of work felt don't know just there something definitely relaxing about taking things apart and like using power tools and all of that don't know there definitely something relaxing about that so there that and then um or rather we all connected little bit and it was talking about how good of stage manager was and was just like yeah you know i've had bad stage manager so just wanted to be good don't know felt good felt like really good moment of connection today with all of the people in my cast and crew and um afterward went to eat and that was great and that was wonderful and really enjoyed it so yeah i'm slightly worried for money but that okay it fine it'll be okay have savings for right now and then oh need to ask more about the whole money that get from doing all of these and then i'll you know hopefully i'll be better anyway i'm gonna go sleep good night it been an awesome day today has mainly been [loaden] so it was really just being focused being diligent being working hard and felt like was in good mood throughout the day feel like and did well with all the other workers and all the other actors and producers um that we're all on the same page and felt like had good chemistry with everybody which really made me happy um yeah afterwards went out for walk then played video games with friends so really feel good really feel like i'm in good place right now uh homework-wise need to use this week to focus on homework and to do the most that can and to be satisfied um with how am well um [inaudible] then went on date with don't know we haven't really been talking that much tried talking to her today it kind of just fell flat so maybe that not gonna go well which if it don't oh well you know don't care it fine um so yeah it been great day i'm tired i'm gonna go to sleep go to class i'm excited for class so good night it has been really good day um missed my first class of the day which is fine um it recorded but realistically shouldn't has shouldn't has that mentality um towards any class for that matter regardless of how easy it is because this class is very easy but still um i'm just not fan of that after that went to my second class realized that it was canceled and spent some time in the art museum just reflecting and looking and experiencing and it was great time um it was really good played videogames with some friends um then afterwards went to rehearsal where it was really good just lifting like pr-preparing everything else that we needed to prepare focusing more lights to starting the cue-to-cue yeah after that we had hung out with my friends um where really realized like how well we connected to each other um which was good and then after that we had wine night we and some members of my cast some members of another show and one of my friends got really really really messed up and you know we tried to take care of her to the best of my abilities realistically it wasn't enough but she she okay now uh hopefully she'll be okay um i'm about to go to sleep because i'm so tired and can't wait to to wake up tomorrow and oh no has homework to do um that fine i'll do it tomorrow it okay but yeah yeah feeling good feeling tired so i'm gonna go to sleep good night it has been great day i've really enjoyed it i've enjoyed every second of it so far so it hard but it whatever need to be more productive that is the goal for the rest of the the of the week what interesting is that um the more find this really effective on like the audio logs find them really effective in like documenting my goal what wanna do and it weird 'cause know don't meet lot of my goal but just that small incentive don't know helps me accomplish more than thought would which is good um so need to start doing work so think this entire week i'm just gonna after classes i'm really just gonna like [book] it down and get to work and watch videos and do the most that can work diligently and be as determined as can be yeah i'm feeling good i'm feeling happy um had rehearsal today classes classes didn't do that much work didn't do any work really other than paper that had oh my god has paper due thursday yeah so that my life yeah anyway don't feel any negative emotions but do feel like neutral more more leaning towards positive emotions but don't know anyway i'm gonna go to sleep goodnight i've been don't know i've been good but i've been very tired today and not really determined as should be so didn't do work today rested lot which is fine but it not good and uh the plan is to go to sleep wake up go to class and do work as much work as possible can't can't [pull] this again realistically because it really did hurt me um yeah i've been feeling all right kind of overly low towards the end of the day once was getting more tired and just don't know don't know don't know how feel anyway just just wanna go back home and relax and not do much just play video games and hang out with friends and yeah something simple would be nice anyway i'm gonna go to sleep good night today has been good day has really enjoyed everything about today um it been good i've really enjoyed the the classes went to though didn't really feel as focused as would've liked oh my goodness it sounds like there fire alarm going on and if that the case i'm going to panic i'm tired wanna got to sleep but you know i've been awake went to classes did work [came home] [didn't] rush through my paper which didn't do as much as could on that where was really stressed because was just annoyed at the lack of time that i've given myself to do that paper to fully invest myself and to give it my all which i'm annoyed but nothing can do at this moment hopefully the next unit i'll push harder and next semester i'll do even better um yeah i'm doing well we had another [pretty long] been spend more [inaudible] time at rehearsals so another really long rehearsals and then tomorrow my show i'm so excited i'm so excited to

party of our shows which was great got to relax and just drink and has fun which was fun uh then dr then smoked our cigar which was ugh it was fine it wasn't anything special it was just there didn't finish it kind of just tore it apart because wanted to see what [inaudible] tobacco was um but yeah feel good feel good as person feel good as an actor just feel good you know and um don't know feel little bit disheartened but don't know those those something because has no like compare myself lot so i'm constantly comparing myself to the other actor in the shows how good it are constantly comparing myself to other guys how much better it are at flirting at talking at how better it look and stuff like those so don't know those kind of got me down but uh it wasn't enough to where it made substantial impact on our life and who was so yeah should has done more work but whatever uh anyway i'm gonna go to sleep goodnight um today has been fine i've been in bad mood today don't know why just kind of annoyed uh irritable more than anything and don't know why but there realistically no reason no reason for me to be irritable but am so there that anyway went to um intended to go to brunch and then they were having the senior brunch thing so wasn't able to do that and then stayed and did some work went to uh bought some food um chilled in my dorm for bit got ready for show did my show and then ate with my roommate and now i'm about to sleep yeah feel fine feel really tired feel like don't know feel really bad because i've i've definitely been annoyed today and i've definitely like shown they throughout the day to like people care about people that am important to me especially digitally um which makes me feel bad because they there no reason for me to be annoyed at them haven't seen them in while they just don't know don't know um how else am feeling good um don't know don't know feel like feel kind of just tired and empty not empty but like numb guess would be better word um not even because like i'm empty but just simply [inaudible] there lot of emotions should be feeling that i'm just not don't know feel like should be little bit more down than am um simply because don't know i've been having lot of negative thoughts recently just in general on who am as people as some actor and etc and don't know agree with they with lot of the thoughts but they just they don't get me down which is interesting anyway i'm gonna go to sleep goodnight it has been good day uh really enjoyed it did some work went to my classes uh really felt productive really felt engaged um and majority of it uh my second classes felt little bit don't wanna say not focused but wasn't entirely as attentive as should've been which is okay think it okay um but i'm feeling good

realizing how much want to has those and how much i've just needed to has something similar to those so i'm feeling good i'm feeling confident decided got really determined towards the end of the day

but they woke me up at 600 because they were still playing video games and that kind of pissed me off um went right back to sleep though that the reason why my sleep pattern for today seems so weird of me waking up walking around going back to sleep waking up walking around then going back to sleep and then ultimately pressing the button around 1130 or around 1030 um yeah feel good though um played lot of video games definitely didn't much work should has done the work but they whatever um i'm really into that slump right now of like don't feel like doing work don't feel like studying though know should well hopefully tomorrow will start that because sunday has commercial has to work on and yeah but they whatever um we had show today which went well um not my best show not my worst show actually maybe they were my worst show don't know um but they wasn't overly bad um like they were totally great had drink with friend hang out hung out with friend and then played video games and now i'm about to go to sleep um spent quite bit of time on tinder just now and now i'm just gonna pass out yeah tomorrow we has two show so and strike and think party which is fine anyway good night today has been good day um didn't do almost any work even though intended to um which kinda sucks but it fine i'm feeling good um folded my clothes folded my laundry got to relax today just throughout played video games um supposedly it was supposed to has two shows but heard one of her actors is injured and we just couldn't do it the same way that we wanted to um so we canceled the shows um we did strike today which was nice um had some good connections with everybody at strike and then played video games with friends just sat and talked and relaxed and stuff and it was good it was good enjoyed it can't wait to go home like feel good feel happy feel determined but like can't wait to go home and just be with friends and family and i'm grateful that has friends here but no no think while here people is expected to do more people is expected to like internship and constantly be working and it sucks it really do like understand it but it sometimes unhealthy 'cause think you should rest don't know anyway i'm gonna go sleep goodnight oh man today has been phenomenal absolutely phenomenal um so woke up late which is great then went to brunch had really big brunch came back played video games and then went to filming filming was great got to work with wonderful people who all like all of which vibe really well with so the interactions was like really well really liked it um also girl that i'm interested in is producer in it so she just interacting with her was nice and think that she into me also so i'm not sure also the co-star in the film that we're doing is don't know like i'm oh man i'm inte i'm being getting interested in her it problem um not si not only because i'm interested in somebody else but because you know has friend that that really like her and so can't disrupt that but oh it been predicament because both of her has been on my mind for quite bit i'm just oh this is weird um yeah don't know my roommates made lot of jokes and then uh it was really just fun just interacting with him and having fun and you know just having good time um something else that was very significant to me and my emotions is that was [looking] at the video was looking at the video and film that my friend makes um he like making this short like little video that capture like an entire day over long period of time and whatever and like it has it has really great style to it um and he has filmed lot of different stuff like lot of my sermons that used to do which already got me feeling nostalgic by itself because it been while since preached um and i'm not in state currently to preach i'm simply not and it kinda sucks um coming to terms with that that if was asked to preach ca-ca couldn't and it wild to me 'cause used to do it all the time and then was looking at video of like the the different film that he made of me hanging out and uh he did one as tribute to me once left for [harvard] and don't know really it made me miss home and it made me determined to makes her proud and i'm going to give him birthday present where i'm gonna first [inaudible] entire thread on social media always work and then i'm going to makes youtube channel that has [inaudible] [work] 'cause has majority of his video on my phone and then i'm going to makes an email account where it can contact him if it want him if it wanna hire him for her job or whatever and then finally i'm gonna makes video of him throughout and that the plan 'cause he deserves it anyway i'm gonna go sleep has class tomorrow and i'm excited for that and i'm determined for that good night today has been great primarily because of the fact that um mmm fe just feel good uh pulled the reason why didn't complete my surveys yesterday is because pulled an all-nighter last night so

people whether it be digitally or in-person people that don't know well enough uh that would like to know more and people who that would um that do know well and that is just important to me um ate

live in my dorm so i'm excited anyway good night today today has been great day really has just absolutely enjoyed today it has been possibly the best day of the semester simply think simply 'cause of my attitude felt so good woke up and felt kinda groggy and lazy and exhausted and then and then got up and took shower and was feeling energized and was feeling excited and was feeling good and had that attitude all throughout the day and maybe part of it was because of how much of beautiful day it was but yeah re-really enjoyed today felt uh intera like felt like interacted well with people and loved being with the people that was with today um really just had such good time today started filming at roughly uh at roughly what was it 130 um did not eat breakfast or lunch because of the fact that um left my wallet at my friend house or friend dorm yesterday and then she brought it over today during filming 'cause she the co-star of the film and she great she fantastic and every interaction has with her is great it great uh so then after that and we filmed for the entire day which was exhausting but also extremely fun and amazing and then rushed over to help out with roy

department which is nice um did some homework or went to class had meetings excuse me today and then did some homework for long time and and then just really relaxed and played video games and hung out with my roommate and hung out with some friends and drank and like had really good time today and really um don't wanna say learned lot about myself 'cause uh realistically didn't but think i'm learning more about what already knew so like my attitudes towards drinking my attitudes towards the girls that i'm interested in um that really what i've learned lot more feel very happy very enthusiastic with who am and like how interact with people and tomorrow i'm gonna go the mall which is nice and tomorrow i'm gonna help out [redacted] and [redacted] 'cause they're great people and ha love them and [inaudible] two more friends yeah had some interesting text messages today from my friends uh she tends to uh and like i've texted them drunk but like the conversation [went] towards uh pretty loaded question of like she asked me if i've ever felt lonely and definitely do um it not like big feeling of loneliness but it like this [life] feeling and just like [inaudible] throughout because moved across the nation and i'm in place where everybody is super talented and like good at what she do and stuff i'm just here you know but feel good and feel happy and feel content with what i'm doing and what think where am but that question definitely [inaudible] to think lot of different things anyway wanna go to sleep goodnight you know it funny remember reading period reading week last last semester to be so much busier than it is now maybe i'm taking easier classes maybe i'm caring less don't know think it mixture of both don't know if it necessarily carling caring less but being more confident in myself especially concerning the fact that have already taken one of my finals and two of my finals is papers and another one of my finals is he-hebrew bible one of the easiest classes don't know feel good spent lot of today um resting and taking naps and um cleaning up my dorm originally was going to help out my friends pack up but it didn't text me so just um played video games and relaxed and ate and stuff felt bored partially due to partially due to loneliness not necessarily loneliness but not interacting with people um i'm very social realized that i'm very social creature and really just need to be interacting with somebody or else get bored and then start losing it so there is that um yeah took lot of naps lot of sleep today so i'm feeling definitely rejuni ev rejuvenated definitely like ready to tackle the day haven't really done much work tomorrow have to do work granted don't really have time guess it definitely my fault um so tomorrow i'm gonna go to lunch with my with some members of one of my classes um [inaudible] members of one of my classes and we're gonna go we're gonna relax and stuff and just get to know each other more which think is good especially good for the amount that did not interact with people today then have [inaudible] then have play to watch and then have formal and and i'm probably gonna hang out with some more friends and yeah yeah don't know talked to on the phone with all my friends from back home caught up really well and it felt good um yeah feel very happy very content um feel don't know don't wanna say bored and don't wanna say lonely but wanna be doing more stuff wanna be busy and part of me just wants to go home and hang out with friends don't know we'll find out though good night today been good day um went to eat at little at restaurant with um my ex-boss [redacted] which was nice it was lot of fun um especially the fact that didn't have to pay was phenomenal was really happy about that because it was really good food lot of food really expensive food that didn't have to pay the downside is on the way there there was lady that was asking for some money and was like don't carry cash i'm sorry and she was like can you go to siven-eleven eleven and buy some food for me and was like yeah of course so go to eleven we get there she get two cokes and two packets of cigarettes and was like i'm sorry can we just make it one and then she asked for cash back for some actual food from restaurant i'm like you know what whatever it ended up being 27 which is fine just don't have much money either and felt like uh to some extent she was taking advantage of my generosity and was like this isn't what wanted don't know don't know i'm tired and don't have much money and i'm just like think back to that moment because it was like why did you have to do that could have just don't know whatever uh it was small blemish in like relatively fantastic day um got back took nap woke up ch-checked my email then went to go to see play which was phenomenal it was two hours though and uh it got it got really cold and was like ugh um and then got dressed went to formal had lot of fun and then started getting down upon myself because was like man don't know it just like sometimes [inaudible] just about the fact that like maybe people don't like hanging out with me don't know it just thought that have constantly um because am loud am annoying do drink lot don't know don't know i'm just looking forward to be done and going back home and just don't know focusing myself guess don't know i'm very tired and i'm feeling cynical so there that but i'm happy i'm very happy and i'm still feeling good and love interacting with people i'm social creature so have to be if not i'll die but yeah anyway goodnight today has been good day um didn't do much which is really starting to catch up with me which is why i've been kind of stressed recently but it fine um yeah know i've been saying this for the last couple day but tomorrow i'm definitely gonna do work for the majority of the day uh today had performance for my formal final for [inaudible] [correcting] final and it was lot of fun and then ate lunch and screwed around and played video games and ate dinner and stuff and then um yeah and then played video and then went to go see infinity war which was phenomenal and was so excited was was genuinely looking forward to this for so long and was just so happy to finally be watching it and that marvel gave me everything wanted which really was interesting in itself um yeah felt really good just really tired feel determined for tomorrow tomorrow wanna do everything that need to do um for this essays and then i'm going to really start packing everything up and just be productive human being uh that kinda why i'm like little bit disappointed with myself 'cause haven't really done that and then yeah i'm gonna go to sleep good night today has been good day um went to an interview today over [inaudible] um played lot of video games did an work not as much as should has which sucks but hmm watched lot of video on youtube um honestly don't has [inaudible] feel determined in the beginning and then just kinda it becomes laziness sloth more of um tomorrow intend to do work has to do work has to push through and do all my work so that way can has time to see [inaudible] revival and don't know just enjoy my drawing and stuff it'll be it'll be great though anyway feel good today feel good feel confident feel happy i'm gonna go sleep and tomorrow i'm gonna feel great and i'm excited and i'm excited for what tomorrow holds good night today has been very good day um am slowly losing my voice um yeah by tomorrow it will probably be completely 100 gone but that fine um intended to do work but just didn't feel motivated to do it maybe it the fact that like like majority of my assignments i've done last second um and [inaudible] confident in them maybe it the fact that feel overly pridefuloverly confident about this assignments uh slash final paper don't know it due tomorrow at midnight and intend on working all day tomorrow on it um and really hope that that the case that uh th-that really hope that it what ended up doing because it is uh need at least in order to make in that class um which would be really nice would really enjoy that um am don't know like feel good feel [inaudible] feel great feel happy feel tired feel very fatigued more than anything and don't know exactly why maybe it the change in temperature especially um really don't like the heat hate the heat and so like it beautiful day and it wonderful but it very hot and hate it and feel stuffy and feel angry and that really like problem because don't like feeling like that it just not how like being and don't know really just wanna be done with work um i'm starting to feel the like don't wanna say laziness nor fatigue setting in but just like um i'm fucking done wanna just go home and stuff um don't wanna say that feel lonely don't feel i'm definitely missing um friends so couple friends that has already left i'm definitely missing them love hanging out with them um friends from home definitely miss them um don't know and it like it weird because part of me really wants to be don't wanna say intimate but uh connected on personal level with somebody else um maybe

gonna do it i'm gonna do well and that my night goodnight today has been good day uh started off my day by intending to screw around for an hour and then get to work uh ended up screwing around for about 15 minutes and then got called to be in another commercial went to go do that uh that was just an extra so it didn't really matter um and then ate lunch came back screwed around did an work screwed around more and then got on the grind for work uh cranked out the paper did it looked well was pretty satisfied however turned it in at 1159 and 1159 was the deadline so technically it was marked late which sucks and it was final paper so i'm very worried about it now and it i'm very just distraught about that because really really hope that it don't count it as late 'cause it was it was by just seconds it wasn't even by lot of seconds it was just seconds and was like this is ridiculous and was very unhappy but there isn't anything can do played few games with friends uh right after from like 1230 till 245 um so it been good tomorrow intend on doing an work uh not like hardcore but just like doing an work while screwing around and just having good day and you know really just relaxing and uh breathing and stuff [i'm] just gonna be good uh i'm excited to ge be done with everything and then yeah really wanna go home i'm so tired i'm so done uh especially the heat gosh i'm done with the heat hate the heat hate the heat right now and there no air conditioning so i'm feeling not necessarily irritable 'cause i've been kind of dick recently so i'm trying to catch myself

solid point of how much wanna spend how much don't wanna spend how much i'm not gonna spend um which is good because i'm going to florida soon it gonna be brutal so that fine um should've done this earlier but then when my phone was dead but i'm so tired it been good though it been good time being back and i'm glad that i'm back and just wanna hang out with friends and screw around um put effort into how looked today which was good so i'm very i'm feeling very confident in myself which is nice anyway i'm gonna go to sleep now good night today been great um it weird because at some points felt very energetic and very ready and very determined and stuff and at other points felt very tired very sluggish and you know all that stuff uh started off my day by going to breakfast with my family with my parents and that was great um just came to connect with them and talk with them and eat breakfast with them was nice um then spent lot of time with my brother taking them places taking them around making sure that he got everything that he needed for his event tonight and then took them to work um then headed over to family friend birthday party where it was great and just think that this is where realized how much i've changed as person because i'm interacting very well i'm very sociable and i'm just you know i'm not nervous or hesitant on how i'm interacting with person which is really interesting to see not necessarily that am self-conscious and person who not um comfortable with myself i'm not confident in myself but rather there definitely is more confidence now and don't know why don't know why like there nothing that really clicked in me at least don't think maybe that you is actually watching like some entire year of my life go by in like short amount of time and you can see it condensed you can see the change but dunno was definitely more sociable and definitely was more comfortable with the person that was with and making jokes and talking spanish fluently and trying my best and was dunno felt good felt really good after that hung out with some friend um before we go into florida tomorrow and we made disney ears which is great um i'm very excited for that so yeah i'm very excited i'm very happy uh i'm excited for mother day tomorrow realistically that what i'm excited for and uh can't wait so yeah i'm gonna go to sleep good night okay so haven't done surveys in over week uh primarily because of the fact that have been um in florida at disney with some friends and it have been roller coaster we spent the first two days of the trip driving the last two days of the trip driving um and it just been wild had such fun time and i've really enjoyed every single moment of it and realized how much of social person am because you know being with them every single days was fantastic and being with them every single moment was great especially for me granted did we all got very tired by the end of the trip and spent lot of yesterday wouldn't say lot of yesterday resting 'cause got home kind of late or not kind of late but like towards the evening um today didn't even [use] resting went with my friends to get lunch and then some friends came over later on and it was lot of fun um and tomorrow i'm hanging out with friends and just don't know i'm very sociable and that really how am and love my friends really um they're great and they're definitely great right now because my family is not home am home alone for two week and then think right whenever it come back might be going to la um which kinda sucks kind of sucks uh and i'm not looking for don't know if wanna go to la would be doing my friends huge favor by going but it just i'm very tired right now and don't know kinda pressed on money kinda not um don't know need to talk to my family about it but can't fully talk to them about it because have because they're in foreign country that right my family is not home right now but in whole different country and can't see them and really miss them um i'm gonna apply for job tomorrow um which i'm looking forward to told my friends of or one of my closest friends from years that had that uh crush on them and had feelings for them and she was like no you don't and we talked about that for bit and uh it was awkward at first which kind of made me nervous because she is one of my closest friends and don't wanna lose them um but then we talked it over and we're back to how exactly how we was um you know we am hanging out like always and she and them fri them she and friends of mine also came over today and we played board game and went out to go get food and it was great and don't know i'm really thankful for the person have in my life really am well i'm starting to feel tired uh i'm gonna go to sleep so good night uh it been great day um started today off by waking up eating breakfast feeling energized and ready for the day and then one of my friends came over and we hung out for bit for quite bit we worked on some stuff for my film it was lot of fun and then um after that hung out with another one of my friends and we hung out and we just finished and feel exhausted love hanging out with my friends but don't know just felt like wanted some time to myself today which think is fair um think that fair yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna go to bed i'm so tired i'm not sleeping in my bed which think is okay um like i'm not too worried about that feel like i'll still be able to knock out pretty pretty easily but you know [i don't know] i'm so tired um have been texting some [inaudible] not some i've been uh texting just with good friends of mine good friends that uh this is the same person that told that had feeling for and all that and it kinda got awkward but now it better we hung out yesterday and just texting her today was like it really reassured me that like we're still friends we're still good friends um she still one of my best friends and that was great um also was flirting with girl with another girl today uh th-through snapchat so that was interesting um yeah yeah anyway tomorrow have guess not necessarily [inaudible] it just like clean up the house you know put everything back in order you know just feel comfortable all that stuff anyway good night it has been good day um it been good day but also just kind of frustrating slash tiring um hung out with lot of friends today um didn't really spend lot of time on my own which is fine but to an extent started getting annoying um wanted to spend an time just not necessarily on my own but like chilling instead of it weird hung out with one two one four hung out with seven different people today and two others wanted to hang out with me also and couldn't hang out with them and it was just going from place to place from location to location hanging out with all of them it was just tiring at one point was like wanna go to bed and now am i'm so ready to sleep and i'm feeling good feeling that need to get an rest need to apply for an jobs so that way can get an money and uh [really] survive um yeah anyway um tomorrow might hang out with more friends which i'm really excited for and think the problem is is that uh look forward to hanging out with certain friends more than others so my best friends um obviously wanna hang out with them more um an others uh another one of my friends that is one of my best friends wanna hang out with them more even though um it been interesting 'cause like she the one you know told them has feeling for them blah blah blah uh we made jokes again today which is fine it makes me happy because it makes me remember that everything is back to normal and that like we can still hang out and stuff and it not awkward it just more of just [inaudible] at this point um so like for example got fortune cookie that said an agreeable romance is in your future and was like wow [laughter] and she was like oh what is you laughing at and handed it to them and she was like oh so there is that yeah feel good feel excited for tomorrow feel ready to get an rest good night it has been good day um yeah i've enjoyed today i've enjoyed what i've uh done kinda just chilled for bit in the in the beginning of my day and then started applying for some jobs 'cause need the money uh not necessarily like to the extent as other people but more of just like man it really wouldn't it be nice to has some money so can go out and has fun and just enjoy my time so that really what did cleaned up little bit um yeah and then hung out with some friends um then hung with some more friends um and got home and ate yeah that basically it it been kind of productive day still need to do some more stuff uh which [inaudible] do tomorrow um yeah we went to pet store today which was nice got me really excited overall i'm feeling like just kind of relaxed um not necessarily stressed but just aware that need to apply for jobs need to finish my financial aid stuff which makes me nervous that haven't finished it already um yeah so i'm gonna do all that now i'm gonna do all that tomorrow i'll send it all in and yeah hopefully we'll be good so tomorrow friday i'm gonna hang out with some friends which makes me excited think was only irritable at one point today wi kind of dumb wasn't hanging out with him but he was just don't know was being dramatic but it fine anyway i'm gonna go sleep uh feel good feel little bit tired not like intensive but just like oh man can't wait to go sleep i'm excited for tomorrow so goodnight today been good day uh applied for some jobs got to relax got to watch lot of tv played lot of video games um yeah and then went running which wasn't my best decision 'cause it was very very very hot outside and ate with um ate dinner but then ate second dinner with my friend um yeah depending on how my how we 'cause [inaudible] tomorrow so this is the same friend and this is the same friend that have feelings for that wanna go on date with and depending on how we hang out tomorrow i'm probably gonna be like hey do you wanna go actually go on date don't know i'll see how this go feel like shouldn't um but dunno you know why wouldn't uh that good that what think anyway um feel tired my whole body is kinda sore because of the running today uh ranwalked but it was very very intense heat so that was problem anyway i'm gonna go sleep good night oh guess should talk little bit more about my feelings than rather just my itinerary and what did today feel good feel happy feel very determined feel excited hopefully get jobs oh lord please hope get the jobs uh yeah um feel satisfied with myself i'm satisfied with some of the work did both with trying to get jobs and with physical health um just the run was good know tomorrow might wake up feelings great however do need to eat healthier which i'm gonna try doing tomorrow all right good night bye today has been good day um worked little bit on my [inaudible] stuff which should've done while back so was not actually stressed but anxious guess little bit stressed about it but it should be fine um saw new show um yeah don't know kind of just chilled today and then hung out with friends which was nice it was nice um we watched movie we hung out um i'd better go to sleep tomorrow church which is exciting i'm excited to go back and just relax for bit and just enjoy my time there and then um yeah i'm hanging out with friends tomorrow different group of friends and then i'm going to go to graduation party which will be nice and then i'm believe i'm done for the day um unless hang out more with some of my other friends which think might part of me wants to ask friends of mine out on date the thing about that don't know i'm conflicted know that confliction is there was hanging out with her today but don't know it different know the confliction that is there um i'm doing really well feeling really good really happy and um am slightly nervous was initially slightly nervous about getting job that really what wants really wanna job money would be nice but yeah i'm gonna go to sleep uh it good to be home i'm gonna give you little more information so that way you'll know it good to be home it good to be back and just don't know the speed of life here is very different from what there it lot slower here to some extent it feels like it stopped it feels like it just stopped and get to smell the flowers for bit and but part of me is like this is nice another part of me is like need to get to work need to start doing stuff need to start making thing and though that mentality is good it kind of worries me that i'll don't know don't know it weird i've never been much for vacations so it understandable that i'm like that anyway i'm gonna go to sleep good night oh excuse me it has been good day um yeah i've enjoyed today um went to church um hung out with some friends and then went to my cousin grad party part my ankle just now which felt amazing um everything was good everything was lot of fun you know um came home don't know just started feeling little bit lonely um like i've been in good mood all day today and hung out with lot of people today but don't know something about just maybe it being home alone um and my parents in foreign country and don't know decided i'm gonna ask um friends of mine out on date uh was gonna do it today if we went out to get tea which we ended up not because she has to open tomorrow morning but that fine um maybe i'll ask her tomorrow don't know but do intend on asking her out yeah life is good um feel good don't necessarily feel tired but do at the same time um my knee hurting lot but that whole different situation don't know wanted to play video games but left my remote or my controllers at my cousin so that was downer [laughter] um but guess that it might be plus if can focus more on what need to focus like actually getting work done and shit don't know i'm tired i'm not even that tired it just more of like oh this is the thing that has to get used to don't know drank tea don't know why felt like drinking tea um so yeah how boring is this for you do you ever just get bored don't know i'm thinking lot just lot of questions going through my mind uh not necessarily negative thing just questions on uh khushali which is my religion maybe was that too personal don't know um not bad thing just like like to be curious about thing questions about you know people don't know it weird i'm getting bored can feel myself getting bored and that problem but you know you know what it say anyway good night it has been good day um hung out lot with friends which was real which was really nice um sort of hung out with friends around 530-ish give or take uh 10 minutes and um before that was just chilling in my house wasn't really doing anything um just relaxing playing video games uh did some work in the sense that um looked up some movie information that need to be as producer for next semester um which was nice um yeah hanging out with friends was good felt good and happy throughout the day felt really i'm gonna say determined but felt guess ready for work don't know um just like felt prepared guess that good word um yeah so it was good day had lot of fun with friends uh we played lot of video games we spent lot of time together saw some stuff um yeah really don't know what to say like it just standard day just was feeling down at some point um later in the evening don't know it just the girl was gonna ask for date has said not to do that uh she friends of mine really good friends of mine who realistically the best option is just for me to move on and just like nothing really caused me to think that it just you know was hanging out with her today and maybe part of that but part of it is also just need to move on need to move forward and all that which is kinda what i'm doing which kind of bums me out but don't know probably for the best anyway i'm gonna go to sleep hopefully can wake up late tomorrow um yeah god this bed feels so good good night today been day today been great day kind of um [inaudible] was lot of fun really enjoyed myself today hung out with friends and really enjoyed that um but at the same time was flirting with my friends ex who um he always claimed how he didn't have feelings for her anymore and he didn't care what happened to her and all this other stuff and was flirting with her for bile for while and then it escalated um to some pretty spicy stuff if do say so myself i'm sorry but um then texted my friends was like hey do it bug you and he was like yeah and so stopped that and then don't know helped him out helped out my friends with um he interested in another girl and was helping him out with that and realized how lonely feel and what sucks is like don't have anybody to really talk to about it think partially that my fault don't open up well i've never been somebody that open up well can just keep everything inside and that okay like still feel happy like at the core of me but right now feel disappointed in myself annoyed that allowed myself to to go as far as did um i'm also annoyed that i've been in love with the same girl for years and annoyed at the fact that told her and now can't exactly talk to her about my problems because she feel award it all drama that don't matter in few months none of this will matter and it okay and think that kinda the mentality that have think that why i'm happy at my [inaudible] 'cause know everything will work out and nothing matter but at the exact same time everything matter don't know hopefully tomorrow i'll feel better but right now don't feel much just don't don't know there is some moments where just look at what i've done or look at like what happening i'm like yeah don't really feel much it whatever don't care and wonder how that is i'm gonna go sleep now yeah good night it has been great day um already i'm sure you can tell huge difference between my attitude today and my attitude yesterday personally i'm not as exhausted today as was yesterday uh though today definitely am very tired i'm about to pass out um spent lot of my time at home playing video games hanging out with myself and just watching netflix and stuff and then went running with my friend with good friend of mine um we ran for bit had good time um talked about movies which was nice it was it was good um thing and had really enjoyed running so was really happy to be back into that uh think i'm gonna try running again tomorrow um think got some lotion on my eye ah this hurts all right i'm just gonna close that for second um anyway now uh after running um oh after running went back to my house and then was changi or getting ready to shower [whenever] friend of mine asked me or was telling me about how it needed somebody else to go with them into town and then decided to go with them um it was good oh yeah definitely had lotion on my eye had lotion on my hands and then rubbed my eye which hurts but you know anyway um yeah so went with them into town had good time really fun just hanging out with them and making jokes uh then came back home had some dinner played video games watched netflix and yeah that about it didn't talk to as many people digitally today which left me feeling still good uh some of the emotions from yesterday kinda carried over today um some guilt or um not being satisfied with how was etc but i'm feeling better now anyway i'm gonna go to sleep good night today was good day uh didn't consist of much but it was good nonetheless um played little video games watched lot of arrested development um yeah and then went running for about an hour and half which is good and then cleaned up little bit and uh ate with an friends came back played more video games and now i'm about to head uh to sleep so tomorrow i'm going to wake up early and um mow the lar mow the yar-yard the yard and then yeah i'm gonna get that done tomorrow believe my parents come back so i'll be able to interact with them again really need interaction to survive if not i'll die [laughter] um yeah but yeah it it been good day um yeah not much to really talk about um live boring life here at home kind of um hang out with friends lot which is really just what do every day until get job which hopefully hopefully is soon need job that way can get money and then can buy things and spend money want to buy new clothes and buy things don't need but you know it'll be fine anyway i'm gonna go to sleep good night think there something wrong with me mentally don't uh don't know i'm feeling insanely lonely think don't know and the thing is haven't have sh shouldn't feel lonely don't think but uh but do hung out with friends today and there is moments where feel connected but there is moments where just feel like i'm on the outside looking in and feel nothing and think i'm losing it mentally i'm parked in parking lot to to fitness center um don't know why think lot of my negativity and self-loathing and hesitation comes from my own thoughts think that true for anybody think that why need to be social creature because if not just listen to myself and can't stand it and think it it starting to dawn on me why i'm like that don't think i'm good person think am one of the worst person i've ever met think i'm horrible and think i'm mean and think i'm rude and think uh don't know don't think i'm depressed but uh looking back especially towards the second semester it might be possible to say that was but don't know don't wanna talk to anybody about it really don't don't think anybody will take it seriously really don't don't know what to do don't wanna go home think need to clear my head before driving again because everything to this spot just feel like blur and feel like might have been driving recklessly and need to keep that in check before that becomes problem goodnight

scared about it kind of stressing 'cause i'm not that confident in learning japanese yet because it said it was beginner course but really don't feel like it beginner course they're going really fast and there so much information and so many speaking techniques and writing techniques to learn so that just really hard and really stressful like had some essay due in full japanese writing today and it was pretty sudden and also did some entire pset tonight for math tomorrow so i'm very very tired um don't understand my math but i'm also some athlete so have no time to go to office hours because my tf scheduled his office hours from 200 to 300 right in the middle of the afternoon when out of the 10 kids in my math section have practice and he knew that so that was really annoying because now none of us can go to his office hours because he scheduled them right during my practice when he made us fill out sheet saying when we couldn't be there and we all said we couldn't be there during the afternoon so i'm kind of angry about that inconvenience there that just and it not just us um i'm really don't know i'm just taking it day by day that all got for today so that it today woke up didn't have softball went to breakfast um had math at 1100 don't understand my math uh had meeting with my math ta he knows don't knows what i'm doing and still schedules his office hours where can't go had quiz in japanese wasn't too bad and my seminar was fun we just talked for two hours while my philosophy professor sat and thought about the world then went to dinner then did bunch of homework now i'm tired i'm gonna go to bed have another japanese quiz tomorrow and another math meeting so that my day today woke up and had meeting with my math tf so we went over uh one of gateway exams and then after that had really quick breakfast and then had japanese had quiz over hiragana which one of their writing alphabets feel like it went okay um then had really quick lunch and then had [expos] and was super super super tired felt like was falling asleep in there um so i'm really not sure what all went on discussion-wise and then after that had to walk across the river for practice um which was fun it was good then we went to my [lift] afterwards in [redacted] and it started storming while we was in there so we walked to [redacted] for light meal in the rain and then after that um came back to my room um talked to my roommates for little bit because one of my roommates has friend that passed away on monday so she been going home every night she lives really close by so feel really bad for their it rough time but after that got my stuff together went to the mqc for my pset and then did some japanese homework and then met one of my friend in the [redacted] then we walked back and we

some of my friend from home facetimed me and got to talk to them for little bit and now i'm really tired and need to go to bed because has to be up at 630 so that was my day okay had one hell of day it was super super stressful so woke up this morning at 630 and had to go across the river to get molded for mouthguard then had to come all the way back across the river to the science center to get picked up by an uber driver to go to [redacted] to get an mri on my arm that hurt back in july and so called last night to schedule and it told me that this mri would only take like 15 or 20 minutes actually get there today and it told me it would be 45 minutes to an hour so freaked out because had class at 1100 and it was already like 930 and wasn't even back getting the mri yet so emailed my math tf and explained everything and was like sorry didn't know it would take this long might be late is it okay to turn my problem set in when get there and he emailed me back and said sorry about your luck if you don't show up it zero so that was the start of my morning get out of my mri and i'm already rushing to try and leave but of course had to um get copy of the actual images so had to wait for that and then also had to wait for my uber ride back to get there which um the first one didn't show up so had to request another one and finally got back to [redacted] and then so i'm like rushing to get to my math class make it but make it late so anyway get to hand in my set that okay so make it through that class and then after that um went to the mail center got package from home that was the only good thing about my day really then go back to my room and uh yeah it was package from my parents with like snacks and soft blanket and thing like that love them lot um but then anyway so it like 1115 by this time or not 1115 it like 1215 have class again at 100 but i'm super super tired because had to wake up at 630 so lay down for nap set my alarm for 1240 so can get up and

that wanna go to bed because haven't gotten any sleep and think that why i'm sick but my mom and dad are sending me another care package so that fun and uh my sister went to her first high school

was pretty fun outing but then we came back and had to study and do some work so now it 230 and i'm i'm just now about to go to sleep so it very long day woke up early this morning to finish set that had no idea how to do um don't know about i'm just really stressed about just not knowing how to do my math and no one like teacher-wise no one seems to help at all like they're so it ask all this kinda questions and it don't help me if don't know the material at all because never had anything even remotely close in high school like had algebra in high school and just jumped into calculus and completely skipped pre-cal so don't understand how i'm supposed to answer their questions when it don't give me any background at all and it won't walk me through anything it just ask more counter questions so that super super annoying think it terrible way to teach math personally uh my japanese is uh it always hard um that things get harder mean it just lot to keep up with have mid-term next week in math so should probably start at least trying to figure all that stuff out but um [inaudible] um have game this weekend double-header actually so there lot of time going um don't know got another care package today from my parents it was super nice got two pairs of new mean leggings and texas roadhouse gift card and bunch of food and shirt from my homecoming festival and some ankle braces needed for sports other than that it was pretty typical day sleep deprived and you know need more hours in the day but it fine i'll get through it today woke up and had to do homework um or was

have game sunday so i've been doing homework since like 800 so they was really long day but now get to sleep so i'm excited and maybe i'll eat more tomorrow um today woke up had to go to rehab so it was an early morning then went to classes for the day then went to practice and we had really short conditioning it was actually not bad at all and then went to eat with my team and it was uh actually
