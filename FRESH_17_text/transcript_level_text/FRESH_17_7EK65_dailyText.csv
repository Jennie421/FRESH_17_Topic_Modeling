24,uh today was kind of long day woke up [inaudible] um went to class saw my um my grade from my test took earlier in the week that was worried about so wasn't terrible i'm gonna ask for regrade because feel like kind of could have got like somewhat better grade but then like after that just like messed up something ridiculously easy where could have easily gotten so much better grade but at least knew the content so guess that really what matters at the end of the day and i'll just perform better next time and just keep grinding um kind of like [inaudible] but wasn't really that upset um and then pretty basic day went to prayer meeting with minister uh [inaudible] started my homework went to the gym but came back was tired took nap um [inaudible] well i'm gonna finish my homework before go to sleep and then just keep going and [inaudible] wake up kind of early tomorrow too yeah wasn't bad day i'm hoping to regrade that three so can at least get like that extra couple points so like yeah and then just need to finish up my homework and just keep pushing keep [inaudible]

77,today was okay managed to wake up and go to the gym lab we didn't have lab today so that was nice [inaudible] conference call but that kind of took lot of time it like diversity [inaudible] thing it took lot of time too wish had done some other stuff [inaudible] for friend um probably gonna study for like hour-ish because have midterm tomorrow like 830 that really need to at least get some on so hopefully that works out personal life straight realize that like i'm in class for almost 17 hours week doing my seminar and the fact that like i'm some [lpsa] in math and it both have sessions and workshops so um that shouldn't be problem next semester but yeah it just like lot to deal with i'm [inaudible] seven days so at least [inaudible] be able to sleep and stuff and yeah did the [inaudible] midterm and this paper here that i've only written out of 10 pages [inaudible] there some other stuff in my personal life that i'm not really [inaudible] certain about what to do but hoping to figure it out

80,today was kind of weird guess don't know it was straight i've went to class got us um grade back on my midterm it wasn't very good it wasn't bad either just have to keep my don't really know what to do after that but just another story um i'm tried to get my sets done before went off to [redacted] it was cool on the way the trip here it was like pretty fun not like out of control but it was okay guess it said the other buses really wasn't fun but that whatever got here i've been chilling with couple friends since um yeah [they said another party really have fun] but just don't like going to kick back 'cause i'm like feel like exploring and just talking to people but yeah don't know we'll see so went to some of the party but it was straight and there nothing like out of the ordinary like and lot of people just said it was trash so we'll see 
81,hmm so today was an experience um enjoyed it though it was probably worth it like the bulk of it you know um and woke up late like called friend we got breakfast and we cut the front of the line to get to [redacted] from [redacted] so that was nice and we got there just chilling it was good like was with people we couldn't find the black tailgate so we spent like long time looking for it that whatever um we eventually did find it did but like it was already late and the game was started so just like stayed for little bit got an grabbed like half sa like sandwich without anything in it you know went from there to um the game the game was okay we got blown out terribly but yeah um was sitting by myself like second quarter and my friend came and uh we was talking like during half time and then like lot of people came by it was nice [inaudible] like lot closer to people and stuff or whatever then another one of my friend who i'm like [actually] cool with like he was telling me how like he was really wanted to leave and go home like today instead waited till tomorrow like 'cause nothing went on at [redacted] right now besides like the black talent show which is like that happens like almost every weekend here so it like whatever so that happened then um yeah so instead we just [inaudible] [up] like we both like just took shuttle back to [redacted] got my stuff and like left but the thing is like there no [service] at [redacted] and they're like um my room my host had like locked the door so like that was struggle so called security and it figured it out we got there [around] the show we still do different show 'cause like he got it before me 'cause didn't get my stuff but it was cool we got here uh and then we ordered pizza watched the game the celtics game it won so that was nice think like the biggest thing was just like and then we watched snl and like tried to do an work we was very unproductive but think it was enjoyed the fact that i'm like with people throughout like the whole weekend and just like enjoy that aspect of it yeah [inaudible] [showed me] me like people who i'm cool with still have my own like [inaudible] personal battles stuff that kinda i've brought to my group don't know [inaudible] maybe these will be part of the answer or the solution hopefully it is 
82,today was gri well was gonna say it was grind but it was actually pretty good like um woke up went to church came back kinda late but it was [great] [inaudible] to get food then started on my essay gym came back some more of the essay had ate showered went to office hours and was like it didn't the sets for this week weren't that bad because like we kne it knew that we would be at [redacted] which was like amazing [laughter] [and i'm glad] so it didn't take that long to like check and compare with people at the mpc and stuff so and it only took like two hours instead of like usually it kinda like four or five um okay and then after that like just got to chill with people and was still like was just like typing away at my essay so have like one paragraph left and like some housekeeping stuff to do and then i'll be able to go to sleep have two classes tomorrow and then oh have interview tomorrow i'm not gonna prepare for it but just need to like think about it so that it [who straight] just gotta keep pushing so leave tuesday already took my midterms and the only thing was worried about was the essay but only have one paragraph left so i'm in good shape

90,today was don't don't even know it was weird don't even like it like had everything together and everything fell apart came back together it was just weird went to class went to the gym knocked everything out later at the end of the day started on homework would watch little bit of tv um oh went to like the research study that took like way longer than thought it should have and then from there went to [bnf] meeting it was productive meeting but didn't really say much what good bro and then like after that like um went to go finish my math set and put something down [also] [inaudible] was talking about my biology set but it didn't really do much don't know i'm not really am uh that inspired kind of in the ruts don't know really don't why and the discussion was about mental health and it was like today at like the meeting with my counselor asked her went to the gym it was like it was helpful but to the extent that like i'm removed from the situation now so it can't really bother me no matter how much try to let it or how much other people try to force it to which guess is relieving but just have to like deal with that and grow in it also got hit with lot of like work oh yes the school also found [inaudible] feels like have seven-page paper for my seminar probably gonna start tomorrow after get my topic reapproved by my professor then after that math got 75 on pre-final which like on one level yeah have to retake it but it also like how bad am doing in the class 'cause everybody said it was bad it was like don't know also have quiz in there tomorrow that need to study for 'cause i've never learned uh logarithms before like i'm gonna try to knock that out tonight and there that and my [ex-law] teacher like wrote my essay completely wrong but was like was hella confident about it so that also kinda and then don't really know what going in you know [bsa] so all that together um kinda messing with my head in that like the mental aspect it just lot going on [i'll] have three weeks to figure it out 
91,today was okay guess like last night like had lot lot of school stuff on my mind [inaudible] really no problem with it it just on my mind and [inaudible] how to deal with it but it whatever uh it good thing guess for now just there like lot of different aspects to it um school woke up this morning was supposed to go to the gym but decided not to and just like stretch 'cause was sore anyway and like [inaudible] much for the rest of the week so might as well just go to the gym like not have like two back to back rest days later on um today went to class had quiz so i've missed couple but not that many then had lab [inaudible] lab went pretty okay and after like maybe five or six attempts finally got my [inaudible] approved for my paper so i'm probably gonna finish that up tonight so like can at least like knock one of the thing off on my never-ending list of thing have to do to get my life together before end of the semester but i'm here 
92,today was okay um it was kind of hustle had three classes one of them [inaudible] from like three hours to one hours which was nice still kind of fell asleep which is whatever um had some quick meetings took nap hit the gym ate with [inaudible] at wing night and like i've consolidated like all my other homework to like the other parts of the week or did them already so tonight i'm going to put in like three to five hours on my essay for [inaudible] so can have draft worthy of reading tomorrow and so can have another draft ready for friday it vicious cycle but i'm not as overwhelmed as was like earlier on in the week probably could have [inaudible] somewhat through it so keep pushing and like tonight is crucial so hopefully i'll be able to push through just keep going um emotionally and socially guess things is straight um [stupid] things on my mind that haven't really decided what to do about yet but just have to see 
93,um don't know today was good day got lot of stuff done it was extremely productive also extremely stressful and it was like [inaudible] like [inaudible] paper [inaudible] right make revisions mean [inaudible] input on [inaudible] section all that and then went made the revisions started on [inaudible] [inaudible] and then after that um the gym finished making that revisions headed [inaudible] compared to the answers to my own uh psats for math and bio i'm gonna go help friend with that [inaudible] i'm tired the only thing left have to do is like compose like three pages of paper for seminar so [inaudible] don't know i'm tired got lot done and should be no reason why stay up really late tonight besides like if want to watch tv or something [inaudible]

99,so um today was okay mean woke up on time right to um have uh [redacted] brief me on my [inaudible] we went over some things it was pretty cool went to math review chem review so just kinda like hung out with friends and stuff and then iike forget what but just like had stuff to do uh like classroom [inaudible] and like think my math teacher we was supposed to have meeting but like it didn't really come together it like got there like 10 minutes late and then he wasn't there but feel like he forgot about it but it whatever it probably better that way anyway and then after that started like more essay revisions 'cause like had writing center tutor reading it for me 'cause like their it it had appointments this week but it was like few and far between so made that um he said he was gonna read it again tonight there couple more things for me to change and then i'ma have really don't know who could have read it but yeah probably one of my high school lit teacher but it like it need it back in day um so there that ah i'm probably going to start oh yeah when got back took went to the gym ate and then like came back and went to sleep am supposed to be doing work [inaudible] don't know why watched tv for like 30 minutes and then went to sleep it whatever though um took like two-hour nap so i'll go to bed at like 100-ish to make up for it so i've been out so if get like two more hours of like study in should be good 
100,uh today was was an okay day kind of busy day because just had like lot of appointments and lot of things to get done it was somewhat productive beginning of the day but then like kinda dissipated um tomorrow morning looks little busy too but yeah don't know all right i'm going to bed like extremely late because was up on the phone with like friend and then hung out with somebody else like it like don't know there is always [inaudible] like connect with people like for so long if that makes sense um have presentation for seminar today and like my [inaudible] paper due tomorrow by 500 still can [inaudible] like um can ask for an extension but if it don't let me use it went back and just like streamlined the thesis and the topic sentences and stuff made sure everything flowed uh feel like everybody should be happy with it it pretty good it seen like what almost seven different reviews so i'm just hoping that because really need so have to get get on my paper but really need one so probably in an hour or so 
101,um today was somewhat busy but okay day guess um i'm tired 'cause went to bed like late yesterday but [inaudible] think it was worth it it was like being able to talk through stuff you know yeah and then today was like doing math and like little bit of chem like from 900 to 1200 and came back went to the gym went to shadowing for my job and then came back ate and took nap and then went to like bible study from like 800 to 1000 now i'm faced with this [inaudible] should try to go harder on chem should try to like watch tv or should just go to sleep all of those are calling my name so i'll probably end up trying to do little of each yeah so we'll see 
102,uh today was it was weird day [inaudible] everything so [inaudible] um besides that uh woke up at like 100 130-ish which is nice needed like that 12 hours of sleep um so that happened and then one of my friends came and got me from my room to hang out [inaudible] two hours of my day don't really know [inaudible] today kind of bit stressful for me um so that happened and then went to the gym ate started studying was able to get through like all of the lecture notes [inaudible] because that really where my weakness is and still have to take mock besides that don't know really kinda confused with everything that like it been bothering me so that always good thing i'm not broke boy anymore um had offers for two [inaudible] had [inaudible] trying to get them to follow [inaudible] but besides that straight 
103,so today was it was day not necessarily better but oh yeah don't don't know woke up went to church that was nice exactly what need to hear get me fired up [for whatever] was tired though [laughter] um and then after that had meeting with my math [tutor] and just went over stuff and after that happened uh hung out with friend 'cause she was leaving today and we was just chilling playing ukulele it was nice [inaudible] and then uh went to the gym [around 800] and after that [was like] and after that just broke down um math mock it was way too long [laughter] just finished it oh and graded my uh my um my bio mock got 70 but like have week to study so there another mock [she] gave myself with so hopefully can get pull at least like highish um gonna need the [that what] [inaudible] [huh] 'cause we've got finals uh and then two two things [inaudible] my personal life like back home [i'm surrounded] in like don't really know what to do about it though like don't know [life's] always in pieces but yeah literally it just like don't really know what to do it tough decision just wanna do the best things for everybody involved beside that it was good day should be able to go to bed like 1230-ish so that all straight 
104,so today was don't know busy day say that lot uh uh mostly nothing really happened in my personal life don't know don't know what i've been doing honestly just went to like review session [with my math tf] for like 30 minutes today [inaudible] study session so got through one of the [inaudible] um i've been going into turn on the gears and grind little bit for [inaudible] the essay so [inaudible] exam on friday and saturday i'm chilling not too stressed so [inaudible] working uh and i'm here this week really just gonna be it gonna be week uh we'll see 
105,um today was like [wasn't that prod a] pretty lazy day didn't wake up until 1000 [laughter] went to the gym had lunch with friend went to office hours but we didn't really end up doing much so then after that um went to the [mock math] but it was like actually proctored and like in the room that we're gonna take it so that was nice but it was universally hard and everybody felt [they did bad] and like that was out of 40 people out of like the 150 that take it and that 40 people are the ones who are like really passionate about it and like actually good at the class so kinda feel bad 'cause didn't know how to do lot of it but don't feel terrible 'cause [they] didn't either we'll go over it with math [tf] tomorrow in the morning and then ate went to bible study for second the last last time i'm gonna be going to church or that church until get back home [and me and] [redacted] get back from winter break for like month then after that um borrowed my friend bio textbook so could like actually read like the the three last topics like since the last midterm 'cause it was the areas i'm stud i'm struggling because haven't been studying them as hard [as if had midterm on them] understand them now more or less so um uh gotta do like [quick-ish] review should be in bed by like 1200-ish gotta wake up at 800 well at 800 but 830 probably but yeah 
106,today was an okay day guess um kinda disappointing but not really don't know being little dramatic um woke up went over parts of the mock exam with my math tf then went to the gym ate and stuff chilled for little bit and then went to um had like [inaudible] phone call like stuff over the summer don't know this is guy from [goldman] but he says he not really sure put in an app anyway maybe it can turn around to something positive not too sure says he don't hire freshmen did one for merck as well so don't know maybe i'll get that uh from pharmaceutical um then went to the the review for math which realized i'm not as bad as thought was like there still [inaudible] things here and there like i'm learning guess just shouldn't have given up so easy on the last problem and had like hour left so feel like couple of bathroom breaks like just clearing my head up and hopefully [inaudible] would've been able to get to it chem slash bio took another mock was surprised at how much didn't know which is good because like it not the actual test but uh [inaudible] review session before [that] um i'm hoping it all works out i'll take saturday morning 
107,so today was an okay day guess woke up extremely early 'cause my friends are annoying uh we had like review session that only lasted about like 30 minutes and then we dispersed um then was at work then went to um the gym uh chilled for little bit did little bit of studying for chem and then after that went to my math tf we talked for little bit then went to the chem office was just like made sure got everything straight it was extremely helpful came back home um to my dorm watched like two hours of tv uh somehow it 1030 and like still need to like do like an last minutes reviewing for math it not really that bad 'cause realize like kinda know everything just make sure apply it and like take my time and read stuff so yeah at the end of the day things are falling into place just gotta make sure perform appropriately and hope do well in my ter mid terms i've been studying lot so been this way so kinda tense 
108,today was an okay day uh well knocked out my math final you know so have another final tomorrow morning so uh this is there um feel like i'm adequately prepared um i'm just gonna run through my day guess so um woke up hit the gym last time i'm gonna be going until like we get back in january then went to reviewed like tried to study and like [inaudible] the test took it and haven't really done much after that i've been like mentally on vacation probably gonna get like an hour or two of study in but really wanna go to wanna be asleep before 1200 so can wake up naturally like early and have time for my brain to adjust and still like because i'm leaving tomorrow wanna like throw an clothes in the lau in the washer so can have like not whole bunch of dirty clothes when go home [inaudible] um [inaudible] probably gonna do like an hour an hour of studying [inaudible] because don't know uh

117,today once again was day don't know ended up going to bed at 200 then woke up to go to church um today is christmas eve so that was that was pretty much the message of the sermon and then from there we came home started getting stuff ready for like for the dinner that we was hosting at my house um the people came we exchanged gifts um and then worked out like in between like getting ready and like the dinner being served was just doing push-ups and sit-ups and then don't know started doing dishes then fell asleep i've been up since then want to get my survey so i'm gonna come back and do the dishes and then after that [inaudible] still have to pack i'm running out of time but yeah

119,um today was another uh day guess um nothing really too pr-pro-pro-productive or crazy but feel like to to went to walmart like [inaudible] others and then like after that we ate and like was asleep in the car and [inaudible] laughing up bit hit the gym came back watched part of the game and started going through um through stuff need to do and [inaudible] productive thought up the solution to my phone problem well thought of like two solution hopefully like one of them works [inaudible] something to like help me [over] until the next time [inaudible] i'll probably be late but late is [inaudible] getting [inaudible] like uh uh [back] already so there that started [inaudible] coming down with the cold uh emotionally um i'm still upset so it [inaudible] that but don't know yeah 'cause some of my problem seem [inaudible] today but we'll see but yeah it good day it just like didn't really do much 
120,today was another okay-ish day guess did not really do much uh yeah [it was] it was bad [laughter] uh we we woke up we didn't do anything for like hours and then we're like okay let go [laughter] and then we went [to the outlet] but didn't buy anything saw like one thing liked but didn't end up buying it [they gave out some] [inaudible] um just looked at pictures that you know like price [inaudible] [really don't like need um but didn't have uh like money] um besides that started movie [with the um] then we went out we ate didn't really do much besides that [inaudible] finish up the movie and then don't know [so that was that] [inaudible] [money] [she didn't wanna cook dinner] like either [i don't know] [came down today] so that [inaudible] uh [inaudible] today but [inaudible] like don't know meet up with somebody but yeah don't know [we'll] keep going through it we leave south carolina um [day af day] yeah friday night so [i suppose it] thing will get better eventually

122,um today was another day uh we left south carolina finally um yeah it was pretty good actually all right my parents are so aggravating trip been [laughter] annoying but um figured lot of stuff out stuff out like based on like what need to get done over break was like took steps toward getting that done also like was able to just don't know just like thinking in like bigger picture what was doing next semester and over the summer had friend like who met over the like last summer who said he gonna help me find something to do this summer like he got plugged in like he was able to work with goldman over the summer so that should be nice um but just like figuring out like what i'm gonna do if over break was cool still kind of annoying now that like i'm doing the survey early because like we're gonna be on the road and won't get back home until probably past 1200 based on like the pace we're going but yeah 
123,today was don't know it was another day [laughter] um oh first of all my bad about it being like so late know it was like basically the next day [laughter] at this point but forgot like [didn't] get notification that whatever um today was an okay day slept in which is always beautiful thing um woke up prayed worked out was supposed to go get pedicure with my friend but like she didn't reply so ended up just uh taking care of little bit of business and got an good news about like spring break thing that was trying to do so i'll be able to know definitely whether or not i'm going tomorrow um my parents forgot [redacted] today [laughter] didn't really do much uh um watched the [redacted] game set up fire stick in my house [redacted] was asking me to do it like since got home so yeah that happened don't know i'm coming to grips on like mental piece of like everything in my life right now so i'm hoping that like i'll continue to just be able to grow in single year so we'll see what dreams may come 
124,today another day went to church was extremely tired we're trying to get our house ready for [a watch night sermon] it was good message then we was with this um nigerian family i'm nigerian too [we all just] [inaudible] you know like we was just with them it was like it was somewhat annoying but also realized like this is what other family did for us so like valued it more so we're getting the house ready um i'm probably gonna do like quick 15-to-20-minute workout 'cause like last time we got home it was already dark um and so that was that couple good things guess through our personal life us and our friend was able to come to conclusion about how to solve like one of the problems was having with someone but don't know that like weight off our chest it was also like us and them is closer now um but yeah i'm going on the acceptance letter is gonna come in by 1200 but i'm just gonna go ahead and do this 'cause i'm not like really staying up past new year just wanna go ahead and like not take care of this so yeah 
125,today was another day uh as was saying like before there like family staying with us it was like yeah went to bed damn late had to wake up damn late so that was don't know had to wake up early it was kinda annoying but it was okay guess there lot to do but it not it wasn't terrible um and then just just thinking about like the spring break opportunity [inaudible] oh got accepted to the spring break opportunity that i've been waiting and praying and thinking about for like really long time um so that happened i'm just like i'm glad that got that so keep going on my day the dishes workout and now just watching ball games georgia didn't wanna step forward and watched that closing alabama games where the championship next week is it in [redacted] that probably [inaudible] then um had some other business stuff to handle this week have lot of applications to do for summer stuff so we'll see where it takes [inaudible] but i'm in good space also spent lot of this morning like reading people papers like like last-minute college applications and then like also dealing with stuff that like definitely won't be problem anymore 'cause left them in 2017 so yeah 
126,today was it was yet [laughter] another boring slow day it was actually pretty good guess um got some good news from some internship applied to so made it to the last round so um have to figure out how to go [laughter] between now and then it in like three weeks but it great opportunity just have to keep pushing um hung out with my mentor and then like two of her other mentees they're like people went to high school with and like we're pretty close so that was it was pretty cool like being around her um little bit aggravated 'cause like my parents was we was supposed to get news phones 'cause my phones messed up like we was supposed to get her today this was like my christmas present but like still didn't get her yet so yeah there that um supposed to get her tomorrow so yeah we'll we'll see how all that works out um yeah but besides that i'm doing pretty good guess i'm not no complaints for the most part 
127,today was it was day it was basically productive but guess it good then woke up at like 800 in the morning to go to my sister doctor appointment which didn't feel like going to and then we didn't do any of the stuff he liked he said he like he told me to wake up so like we'd get other stuff done throughout the day he didn't do any of that so ended up just like wasting whole bunch of time but like was able to do my personal statements so get lot of like stuff for applications to do [inaudible] first up and i'm figuring out like who to ask recommendation letters from and just like start an [inaudible] and stuff um i'm gonna start the cs class so have to prepare for my interview that in like two weeks and there been like lot of like housekeeping stuff i've done it was good besides that it just like busy not really bad though so just one of that day but um besides that things guess are good don't know haven't really had that much time to think hopefully i'm gonna start sleeping better and like just doing better in general but yeah i'm good besides that 
128,today was yet another of those days [inaudible] [up] [inaudible] um [inaudible] [done] early 'cause one like only the last of those like related to me so instead just went back to bed so of course he was mad um so those happened and then like we had to clean our house so cleaned [the loft] cleaned two bathrooms washed our stepmom car um now i'm just tired but still have like some stuff need to get done um like [cleaning] [inaudible] [my head] [inaudible] um [inaudible] yeah [inaudible] last night and also i'm just doing this well this is the second [inaudible] [but] don't really know maybe like [inaudible] relog into the account not too sure but yeah 
130,um today was yet another one of those days [and i] feel like every single one on break is gonna be until my parents go parents go back to work [and when i] can go so we just go back to school [but didn't really] get those much done um did lot of dishes i'm probably going to have to like do more tonight because more people came over my uncle funeral was today um it was touching but it was like was extremely tired from doing dishes last night so just feel like this is vicious cycle those i'm not gonna be able to break till leave or the like it start going back to work um still have to prepare for my microsoft interview haven't even started those um didn't work out today now don't know i'm gonna figure it out eventually i'm just one tired two aggravated so yeah nah i'm i'm surviving i'm kinda ready to go back i'm not ready for school though 
131,um today was yet another day spent most of the day at church and then at home doing dishes um actually managed to get part of workout in just had to do some sit-ups take shower there actually like reason why [inaudible] so like can go ahead and like at least try to start the coding stuff and was able to pick couple of friends up like metaphorically helped them feel better so guess like that good thing uh but i'm doing well besides the fact that caught my sister cold when she was staying in my room because there are too many people in this house i'm glad because [inaudible] don't mean this in like bad way but [inaudible] just like lot of stress [when she came] i'm glad that like get the next couple of day to just like chill and prepare for this interview because have no idea what i'm doing only have like what like 11 day now um yeah and want to see my homies tomorrow but don't really know how to make that move how to make that work um because my dad going to be at work and my stepmom she don't have work but don't really know what she doing because like it supposed to be like icy road conditions [inaudible] also like the middle like the college football [inaudible] championship like are [inaudible] like at the school go to so don't know how it going to work out at all thought about it haven't really done much like preparing for it so we'll see 
132,today was actually good day good day it actually [inaudible] just [inaudible] needed to do um my dad um agreed to let me go to the cultural [inaudible] of the championship 'cause [inaudible] downtown [later] um have cold i'm bit 
133,um today was yet another day um need to find better day 'cause these day have not been working recently um so yeah we came back from the [inaudible] championship it was cool um it was nice to be able to hang out with my friends haven't seen them in while um woke up went to the gym and then 'cause stayed the night at their campus [inaudible] so we did that and then left went to the gym took care of some business [inaudible] [breakfast] whatever then left came back home [inaudible] my dad well went with my dad to pick up my little siblings and then we went to go do well wro wrote letter of recommendation to my teacher instead of the other way around but it was it was she probably the best teacher had ever had the pleasure of taking so it was just like it was really touching to be able to do something for them instead of the other way around um so that that happened um the other side of that got really lazy after did that so instead i'm probably just gonna watch movie tonight and like handle like some like email stuff like summer opportunity stuff but like haven't started coding for the project that well for for the internship interview that have next week which is problem have tomorrow and the day after 'cause i'm probably going out friday night so we will see how all that works out yeah [inaudible] it was good day just need to use my time better 
134,today was pretty okay day um once again slept in till like noon um started doing some of the coding stuff didn't get lot done but like basics guess um got some work i'm going to try to knock out tonight and then i'm gonna work um but i'm watching tv right now let me do that and then go to sleep was trying to go to bed like relatively early hopefully not later than 200 so like can wake up in time to go um by 930-ish 'cause i'm supposed to go somewhere tomorrow at like 330 um yeah i'm supposed to go to lot of places actually but yeah um have that and i'm just trying to make sure everything work out 'cause leave saturday so need to pack need to just prepare for this i'm also trying to go somewhere tomorrow and friday so we'll see how that work out i'm praying about the interview process um reached out to somebody who like over panel with somebody who had done it earlier so just need to make sure like it follow up with me and hopefully all that work out in one way or another 
135,today was yet another it was day but it was probably better one so knew was going somewhere today so woke up earlier probably 930 um prayed worked out and started coding lost like an hour for an activity but picked back up like about two three hour of coding you know like it was good 'cause [inaudible] the most progress [inaudible] just straight progress would actually have um probably going to yeah need to do an more but have like have seven day now so yeah that should be cute feel like i've done the by tonight i'll be done with the basics and tomorrow can like try to like submit [inaudible] that but then like at 400-ish went to hang out with friend from high school um so that was cool or whatever for [inaudible] funny but yeah it was good people came back home hmm started trying to do stuff but got distracted by tv and then fell asleep and now here we here we are um gotta do an laundry start packing and yeah also need to finish the coding stuff also [inaudible] so we'll see how that works out 
136,today was yet another one of those days um probably gonna be the last one of those do-nothing days those have for long time because like it my last days in [redacted] before go back to [redacted] uh tomorrow my flight at 1200 um but sure guess didn't really get much done but feel like low-key deserved it um [inaudible] was supposed to go [inaudible] basketball game at my high school but like um yeah didn't come together so sure canceled plans to do nothing which is not always good thing um [inaudible] finished packing and finished this tv show started because like really wanted to watch it but like didn't really have the time had time today because didn't do anything makes me kind of glad went out yesterday instead um yeah i'm chilling i'm good though mentally and physically was worried about the internship interviews like money in general and um kind of had spiritual not breakthrough but like somebody else did [inaudible] and he said he was gonna pass on the information [inaudible] so hopefully all those works out we'll see how it do or doesn't 
137,um so uh came back to [redacted] today uh so last night [inaudible] was like kind of thinking about it [inaudible] sleep [inaudible] couldn't sleep so decided to keep watching tv till like an hour before the time was supposed to wake up [inaudible] took powernap and then woke up like three hour later or two hour before my flight was able to catch it but like in the time like made error in judgment you know like like brought like an liquid like an cosmetic stuff that like that obviously tsa throw away but it was like could have easily left it at home because couldn't bring it with me had to buy more anyway but like at least could have had it at home stashed but [inaudible] and then the church got to here it called me and then it picked me up from the airport got ice cream took care of an business not really that much though um continued to watch tv unpacked um yeah that just means have to [inaudible] before thursday [inaudible] ready for that and then also kind of irritated about my money being lost and also little bit [inaudible] but that whatever 
138,today was an okay day woke up went to church low-key fell asleep but yeah um don't know still need to figure out like what i'm doing with church classes like [inaudible] was supposed to have conversation about it like where we're going and all that but didn't have that conversation yet um then came back took nap uh from there hit the gym ate for the first time since since i've been home [laughter] since i've been back in [redacted] and then um yeah i've been chilling since then it been like good like two two hours that sat um but yeah after that i'm just gonna take shower and try to like start practicing coding because like have an upcoming interview that i'm not prepared for so i'm gonna try to like binge study today and then do an more tomorrow at work 'cause got work at like now and then from there just see what happens and hopefully and hopefully the best will happens we'll see what happens 
139,um today was another day woke up kinda early went to my first day on my job every single thing went wrong but still in good mood for some regardless of that um gym was clo they closed early 'cause today was holiday didn't realize that so just worked out in my room for little bit then went to the meeting for um [cure] for the conference i'm here for that took way too long [laughter] and came back home started watching some videos from from the cs lectures from like cs50 'cause didn't realize they was [online] that another resource have between now and my interview thursday still hoping that goes well um hoping and praying that goes well uh besides that nothing really blar glaringly wrong just worried about that um and i'm trying to make sure everything comes together we'll see 
140,today was like one of the more stressful days that i've had [laughter] recently probably because i've been on break for so long lot of good things happened lot of bad things happened it not even bad just lot of things have happened um woke up went to work wo well woke up went back to sleep [laughter] and then went to work then was able to uh um to go to the gym after and eat you know like finished at quick time but then wasted time doing someth like ju it was just dumb and then like had to go to the meeting for the conference i'm here for um and that took like we started at 400 we didn't leave till like 830 then just left from that and had meeting with my pastor about like some of the the stuff i've been like thinking about like spiritu-spiritual questions or whatever um so moving on from that have about five hours-ish of work to do before have to catch my flight tomorrow morning well it at noon but yeah before tomorrow um just need to grind and get that done i'm stressed because of how much have left to do um 'cause like how long everything is taking hoping i'm able to get through it though 
142,today was pretty good day um woke up and had my interview for microsoft it went pretty good think um everybody like acts like afterwards where can [inaudible] um how it thought did they're sort of like great you know it just like don't know it was very it was supportive didn't really see anything that wrong with it um it didn't ask me any like specific like coding questions so don't know if that like good or bad thing but we will see like at the end of the day uh it said we'll find out like next week and then know it don't know like if need to apply to [inaudible] um so yeah that happened that pretty like pretty much all did today so most of people really cool um like made some friends uh had to leave for my flight around 900 930 so went to eat and go back to my hotel to shower and chill watch the game and then [try to] leave so can like be on time for the the flight so have to be back tomorrow for the conference so think everything will work out hopefully we'll just see how this go 
143,um today was mainly good day i'm gonna pick up from where last time recorded um mostly tiring though it was good just tiring um so had the interview went pretty well it was kinda weird 'cause it didn't ask me any like specific coding questions but it said all the interviewers said did great and like it wouldn't waste all their money and time flying me out there if like if it was gonna reject me for not taking like formal cs class anyway so we'll see how that works out um after that worked out ate went back to the hotel for while to chill before went to go catch the flight it was red-eye and like while red-eye sound like really great in theory realized like one didn't go immediately to sleep was watching tv for good two hours on flight then after that like you're still losing the three hours in like changing from the west coast to the east coast time so i'm off like about two hours of sleep right now so got back to boston um went to the [inaudible] conference for the club i'm part of um was able to help out little bit took nap while was there for like good like 30 40 minutes um then went to the gym after that i'm probably just gonna head back and chill uh 'cause got works in the morning besides that [inaudible] was kinda anxious about figuring out what gonna [go wrong] with the thing 'cause don't find out for another week so yeah i'm here so 
144,um today was surprisingly busy but not necessarily bad um the only other thing had to really do was worry about um um my placement test i'm probably gonna take it tomorrow but realize like don't need to [inaudible] spanish [inaudible] just need to like brush up on the grammar stuff that i've forgotten so i'll probably study too go to church tomorrow then study and [inaudible] so can probably do the best as possible or hit the gym in between that um so yeah still kind of nervous about the internship um interview but started then don't know questioning like my faith and stuff i'm supposed to meet with my professor tomorrow but besides that went to work in the morning then afterward went to go home help with the conference for the [inaudible] [inaudible] it was lot of work but there wasn't [inaudible] that really just [inaudible] me how tired am from the layover of the flights and stuff so gonna go to sleep tonight and was gonna go out friday and saturday but might just like cancel friday and then like make an appearance saturday but not do much so yeah that where we're at right now 
145,today was fairly aver-average day um woke up early from reading with my pastor was talking about the last recording uh don't know kinda got like more involved than wanted to but it whatever um some thinking to do and went to the gym ate uh came back and took nap and then uh studied for like my spanish placement then little bit then took it eh it went okay there was some stuff wasn't sure about and then pretty sure missed lot of like the last four questions we'll see [inaudible] like 150 or so questions don't know when get my score back but yeah we'll see um made my schedule more or less so have to figure out like which gen ed i'm gonna take this semester [or] [inaudible] [seminar] so yeah there all that going on but we'll see 
146,today was actually like great day um don't know woke up on time went to class um it was like math meeting and then went to like my first class and then um after that went to the gym [inaudible] and then finished working out came back went to work went to counseling [inaudible] don't know it was actually like really good day because got lot of uh stuff done um just like hanging out with people realizing that my friends [inaudible] still kind of lost about like what class i'm going to take but um got past the first round of my spanish placement test so hopefully that work out and don't have to take it at all because have to take like the 45-minute version part in people um so yeah there that so i've just got to get through that um so now [inaudible] [about microsoft] later on in the week so my friends was telling me like some people got rejection letters already hoping that not my lot but we'll see today was pretty good day [inaudible] you know little bit of stuff to do there but yeah 
147,so today was good day um nothing out of the ordinary woke up went to work uh got paid extra for one of my shifts but the thing well got overtime for one of my shifts but somebody uh because of that wasn't able to shop one of the classes that wanted to so i'm gonna ask somebody on my floor 'cause he went too so hopefully like it really easy [laughter] 'cause need like an easy fourth classes 'cause i'm taking biochem and math which is gonna come back to bite me in the butt but mean took [inaudible] math and chem last semester and didn't die yeah we'll see um so yeah all that happened and then uh worked out later with somebody in my dorm it was cool whatever like 'cause haven't worked out like with somebody in long time uh uh um and now i'm just kinda all stressing over like the second part of my [inaudible] placement exam have tomorrow and then like 'cause got exactly what needed to get this this far i'm hoping that i'm able to place out and then um i'll find out about the internship well an people already did but i'll find out like at an point throughout this week or so hoping that goes well uh yeah everything pretty much is working out so i'm not worried about that two thing it was overall decent day no complaints 
148,so today was um it was relatively uh it actually was good day um so woke up went to the class sp only had one class today 'cause class haven't like officially started yet decided not to take one of the other class was thinking about 'cause it looks like like too much work not lot of work just too much com well like compared to like what i'm thinking about doing kinda finalized my schedule uh it was rest day for working out took my spanish placement test and then did my math set the first one is due friday so at least got that out of the way then i'm going to section for my class tonight um uh yeah it was really all have like going on i'm probably gonna watch tv and chill napped in the middle of the day oh and passed my spanish placement test so don't have to take spanish [laughter] so i'm thankful for that and i'm kinda anxious waiting on like the results from my microsoft interviews 'cause like some more people have started getting theirs it was like it said sometime this week or next week so we'll see what happens hoping for the best 
149,um today was good day but feel like i'm still riding the highs of like other day um let me see where do start woke up went to work and then went to class was tired in class but then went back to work picked up some more hours had to cancel my first seminar because like it conflicted like my my mandatory chem class or bio class [inaudible] then went on from that into um yeah picked up some hours so like my check should be like amazing size so there that then went to um like to the gym with friend and after that like went from meeting to meeting to meeting but like kept seeing the same people there it was like it cool because get to like don't know [inaudible] like the people [inaudible] whatever [inaudible] um and then had meeting with my freshman um advisor so he was helpful um appreciate him and feel like i'm gonna roll my class now and just see how life goes so hopefully because like i'm taking [inaudible] i'm taking like my [inaudible] is kind of comparable to what did last semester [inaudible] had to make sure [inaudible] yeah and not get complacent and make sure keep [inaudible] yeah feel like i'm pretty doing pretty well right now [inaudible] finish [inaudible] i'll probably watch movie first honestly

196,um today think uh ended off yesterday like after got to the airport but today basically just like after all the flight stuff that handled my friend took me home we chilled with his mom for second and he took his mom picked me up and then he took me home and then went to watched tv went to sleep [inaudible] like [noon] um started watching movie uh was really just taking more naps throughout the day um i'm gonna like try to consume all the information got for [inaudible] then i'm gonna just like make sure that i'm able to [consume] [inaudible] [make sure that this weekend] or like give it out to some of my friend who asked me for it [inaudible] i'm all right besides that maybe just watch another movie or go back to sleep but yeah [inaudible] i'm chilling don't know if just talking to friend and stuff will [inaudible] the house all day which is great feeling have like no responsibilities today 
197,um today was okay guess started it off bit more productive and like started getting stuff done earlier by earlier mean like 100 [inaudible] 100 in the afternoon yeah um mostly just chilled got some stuff done um tomorrow well you know it church and it was uh was just doing like little bit of math homework had left from just watching tv chilling and sleeping um it was good getting to see everybody i've seen my grandma and grandpa too um but think i'm just gonna knock out like the few stuff had left like 'cause had to do test [inaudible] for my math homework and then the dishes just keep washing and all that it i'll see what happens i'll be okay though 
198,today was like really chill day so much so that like don't even know what i'm doing with my life um woke up in like um woke up at like 100 in the afternoon prayed did like five-minute workout um took my [inaudible] everything start to watch tv and napping so like big nap for like two hours or so all good somehow was back on earth with [inaudible] ate um just came in the kitchen little bit um didn't even finish watching the movie probably gonna start my [inaudible] application um feel kinda zoned out too i'll do it tomorrow [laughter] but yeah that really one of the 'cause i've already done all my spring break homework that probably one of the things that needed to get done [laughter] but i'm just like i'm so tired slash lazy mostly lazy but yeah don't know uh i'll probably knock it out tomorrow um saw that don't know must have been going about the same pace feel like too good but not too bad so [inaudible] i'm gonna do this summer um was warming up to the idea about doing um research kinda like open source or [inaudible] like just got word that like there possibility of me like finding free housing so have to figure out how to do that yeah 
199,today was relatively slow day 'cause looking back i've only been awake for like 10 hours and i've already taken nap and plan on going to sleep within like the next hours or so um woke up [knocked] some stuff out my old teacher um wanted to go to lunch with me so we did that we ate talked um she really helped with like given me insight and like helping me find like the emotional path need to be on and appreciate her [do] it um it was like after that came back by 700 it been four hours attempted to start my finish [inaudible] application but there was so much [on there] didn't know so my dad he out of the country right now so he said he will just help me with it later [inaudible] leave tomorrow morning um so i'm just gonna go to sleep now instead of trying to stay up so can like actually be on time for my flight i'm probably gonna wake up by about 7ish yeah 
200,today was it was weird da not really weird just like didn't really sleep last night but then eventually did um woke up in time for my flight uh my stepmom dropped off some [inaudible] realize i'm actually probably gonna need this whatever would've been better just [flying off] and like leaving but yeah um which was nice of her almost like got back worked out real quick [inaudible] shop and bought whole bunch of stuff um yeah don't know it was it neither here nor there um yeah i'm still kinda thinking of how to [inaudible] same type of stuff um like what to do this summer uh like letting go of things like in the past and don't know trying to keep everything focused guess or trying to figure out how to just make the best out of what have [at the moment] 
201,today was it was don't know it was day that was daze um woke up went to church it was great service um to to like actually get out and be uncomfortable and do like the calling of like what god asks us to do here on earth um then after that went to um tried to go to the gym but like even though it said it would be open [inaudible] like it was closed when went over there so um [inaudible] today took shower went to [inaudible] office hours [inaudible] three hours bio like an hours ate dinner for the first time [inaudible] oh the church had pizza so [inaudible] um yeah right now i'm chilling watching tv uh compare my math piece though before turn it in or turn in tomorrow but yeah just been sitting here reflecting and thinking and just don't know [inaudible] my teacher told us [inaudible] and about like my life and my future don't know just thinking we'll see what happens though 
202,hey um yeah this is completely awful like did the actual survey like an hour ago but forgot to do the the audio part but today was it was weird day it was my first day back to class in chemistry didn't learn single thing don't know if was sleeping on an lesson but like picked up on it so like was able to like get through like the set [inaudible] later on so that happened then went to the med school campus to go to [inaudible] to like for little [inaudible] start-up that i'm part of so did that then ca had like two phone meetings and then once got done with that like immediately went to sleep for like an hour and half woke up [inaudible] and found like it lowered my productivity throughout the day but feel like deserved it but that happened got through uh hit the gym saw an friends for bit then showered and went to [inaudible] not [inaudible] [actually said it] and like i've been got done with that around like 1015 1020-ish but it was just don't know just been like feeling stuff out and getting [inaudible] like actual like living stuff done 'cause just had whole bunch of emails and like whole bunch of stuff to go through think i'm closer to figuring out what i'm gonna do this summer um but yeah hopefully [inaudible] on youtube um thing that kind of i've done today um besides that i'm not exactly into this space but i'm thinking and talking about it so guess that good and then like possibly after that i'm gonna be able to like don't know i'm gonna go see the layout and yeah 
203,today was uh it was an okay day guess um had phone call for the little the thing do at the [med] school it was like an interview knocked that out uh started the paper but didn't finish it i'm about to haven't done much work um so went to class had meeting with like an exec on facebook for about 30 minutes didn't really talk but sent him an email so hopefully something comes from that um had class [lab] pretty much understand most of the content though [inaudible] so that was positive um so [inaudible] [my dorm] hit the gym got out around like 830 it was like started like being sluggish and like wasting time because like got back and out the shower [inaudible] 800 [inaudible] 930 it 1100 now but i'm getting stuff done just really slowly so hopefully can still go to bed like at decent hour or at least like yeah i'll figure something out yeah but i'm in relatively good mood probably because of productivity oh and got an email from another summer program but it wasn't like yes or no it was like uh do you want to work with us and feel like the answer to that should always be yes yeah um we'll see what happens there 
204,today was okay guess um woke up had phone interview for director internship for [inaudible] which did not realize had applied to apparently [inaudible] for me to get it and it want decision by friday honestly don't think i'm going to take it but i'm going to ask couple of upperclassmen what it think about it class oh was like surprisingly up and like active early throughout the day but was tired but got through it got to the little [inaudible] sleep study at [redacted] that was supposed to do um was lucky enough to get there before snow get in and get out before the snow fell got lot of homework done while was there so don't have that much to do [inaudible] and like yeah and then like uh took nap so i'm in relatively good mood don't have lot lot to do but feel like it just to like start knocking stuff out um all right now i'm just waiting on some food because like my friend ordered some and i'm trying to [inaudible] because didn't missed dinner because of the study but besides that in pretty good mood like [inaudible] but not that much um and heard back from the thing [inaudible] so might do that and combine it with another internship and like use both stipends so yeah there there promise 
205,so i'm gonna start off from last night ended up staying up lot longer because like one my chem homework took me took me longer than thought it would and yeah tv um woke up got lot of stuff done able to push through the day um but like everything like fell apart like after [500] got email back saying no about the program well combining the program 'cause just really wanted both stipends um about it took me way too long to close the store at work 'cause like there was customers in there who was just being rude and then like the machine wasn't working so have to call my manager about stuff like that the dining hall was closed and now i'm here i'm just don't know going to pick the scraps back up and see what can do yeah 
206,today was like the climax of lot of stressful stuff um i'm gonna piggyback up from where was last night last night was like okay this isn't gonna take me that long i'm just gonna go to bed early yeah it took me lot longer think 'cause [had] my first psat so [inaudible] and then just like study just everything took longer than thought it would just like attending to business and stuff and then today was the day of like actually getting the business done [inaudible] well first went to the gym early in the morning had well went to bed like 300 woke up at like 800 to go to the gym called my dad he was like you have to do [inaudible] told him yeah then got that cleared um [just] like dealing with thinking about that all day and now like all the other things that like had to like trouble including my school psat and just like had work like school work and like physical work um but got through everything went to [inaudible] which was nice but like got tired in the middle of like the sermon kind of things at the end and feel like missed like some of it but got like the general idea but i'll try and do better next time and then besides that um yeah i'm been doing good like productivity wise but just like the volume is very high don't think [inaudible] but i'm managing so should be able to knock out the rest of it in few and then call it day should be good 
207,so today was uh guess got started with last night um had like relatively more than thought did so like had to get all that done um so like don't know ended up taking way longer than thought it would uh just watched movie to chill at the end of the day uh woke up today around noon hit the gym hit new max so that was nice and then did study session for my [inaudible] midterm uh haven't studied that much honestly but there not really that much to study just [all the] notes [inaudible] understand how to do everything but like make sure practice and stuff went to work uh just left and about to knock some more work out and then don't know either go to party or just chill so it relatively good day 
208,yeah so today was weird day [laughter] um woke up like extremely tired probably 'cause went to bed at 300 in the morning but yeah uh tried to listen to the 900 am service for church but was too tired so just went to like went back to sleep woke up for the 11 o'clock one um and it was cool it was actually like really good service and don't know he changed the topic from like being about like passo like palm sunday and like the easter story to something that was like about relevant like current events and just like life it really touched me and actually cried and haven't cried in minute but appreciate like the emotional release then left my bible there didn't figure that out until got back to my dorm so that was like another 30-minute walk that was unnecessary had meeting with the [pre-med path] who also doing bme it was just like extremely helpful like uh she just like don't go [laughter] uh after that went to the chem help room [about to] go to the bio one and then math later 'cause have three sets due tomorrow in good mood just gotta get through keep pushing got midterm this week then have four more week of class six more week [and then i'm up] in [redacted] so just trying to get there 
209,um today was weird had um the admissions officer from chicago like that knew like because applied to chicago she was in town she asked me like take her out for breakfast think she she thought like had free like meals don't um so that [inaudible] so it was cool and have like relatively lot left over um so yeah that happened and then went to um went to the gym had quick workout then went um to class made it on time then was dumb tired in my head [inaudible] one of the crucial eight steps [inaudible] was able to figure out later on in the homework yeah that happened and like went back to my dorm took nap um and then it like had another phone interview but [inaudible] don't know if want the job because can't do it anyway i'm probably not gonna get it because they're only picking two people um then went to ocs some talks or whatever then started doing my homework it wasn't hard but it seems like lot longer than thought because like supposed to be done with like the majority of my stuff like around now so just like come home [inaudible] meeting [inaudible] like study for ps midterm on wednesday that didn't really happen still gonna get it done because of my extra energy from the nap but um probably gonna end up grinding on like the little like housekeeping stuff have to do [inaudible] like do little bit of studying for my midterm next week and then like right now [inaudible] doing ps so i'll just probably be late because like honestly don't want to be there that long anyway because the conversations aren't gonna be hella productive so yeah 
210,today um don't know so i'm gonna pick up from like last night guess so ended up doing like was li very unproductive but also got like lot done too so it was like weird balance between the two was able to like get fair amount of stuff done just not like as much as i'd hoped got like stuff knocked out like from today and tomorrow so like it shouldn't be as bad um aside of that um yeah went to bed around 200 woke up at like 1000 uh hit class [inaudible] paying attention now so won't be struggling at the end of the semester had lecture for [ls] [inaudible] which was nice um and went to ma uh was supposed to go to math but like just went to sleep instead woke up like an hour in uh no he didn't care and then like after that um went to lab just got out went to like little [inaudible] thing don't know if i'm gonna do it but it sounds interesting it just like it gonna rock my gpa next semester 'cause like this stress that 'cause like i'm i'm breaking down right now so especially if next semester have to do it again don't know don't think it would be that bad if did like broader subject like the gpa would've mattered it would just be [inaudible] gotta see i'm trying to take [inaudible] math and cs at the same time and they're like [inaudible] could [feel] like [inaudible] class like extremely easy and like know there not lab component for [cs50] but still lot regardless and just something to think about 
211,so um today was okay guess woke up in time for class didn't make breakfast but ate after like had class like 10 to 100 was hungry but it was okay um so yeah ate came back did like lot reviewing for chem because like i've been slacking recently hoping like understand everything was able to like do the review sheet like by myself uh without looking at well with the notes that like wouldn't be using for the test so it wasn't that bad uh that mainly what i've been doing took nap so hopefully i'll be like in better mood uh i'm not exactly that nervous just like know need to do well in this um feel like prepared did like little bit of like other stuff like business-wise so like won't have that much to do after the exam i'm probably just gonna lift um probably like two hours of homework don't know like some tv probably call it day yeah the week almost over thank god um but yeah i'm here uh still don't know happy got the thing for the summer hoping that like can maximize and do other stuff with it and then besides that just um try to make sure my grades are [inaudible] really yeah in relatively good mood i'm in good mood just [inaudible] different yeah 
212,um today was kind of don't know i'm gonna go based off of yesterday think ended after sent my midterm um yeah it was okay it was just like it was hard but everybody said it was hard so that reassuring um now when got uh home read did lot of watching tv uh [laughter] 'cause empire came back on ended up going to bed at like around 300 woke up at like 1100 for my 12 o'clock section um 'cause my 11 o'clock class got canceled my [inaudible] class let out early it was pretty good day guess and had capital one interview for like the summit they're having it was messed up lot of easy stuff [laughter] besides that it felt pretty good about it guess there just like just like the interview itself went well but then like the fi last five minutes was like there was just some of the equations thing that like should have it should have been easy to do don't know why kept don't know kept messing it up like yeah she was patient with me um then had meeting with iop that lot of relatively lot of work yesterday knocked out tonight um we will see what actually gets done and yeah um yeah we'll see what happens it lot to do lately we'll see don't plan on like doing that much else tonight though 'cause it my rest day at the gym my friend had concert but tell him to go 'cause mean we're not even close like that and then there um it was hackathon it was like probably wouldn't go to that either honestly yeah i'm probably just gonna stay in and do homework 
213,so today was don't know it was weird day um went to bed around like 200 or 300 but was like i've already taken like two-hour nap so well really like uh three hours [laughter] throughout the day um but yeah that happened woke up around 800 hit the gym went to class to office hours hit hack-a-thon didn't really do much but experience is experience [laughter] um then put package in the mail was like yay finally get paid 'cause just sold something on ebay um so that money should clear like next week i'm getting paid [instant] so that nice uh then went to work uh after that went to get dinner but then like got and then went to church [just thought i'd share it with] some friends but it was it it be it started off as like good discussion didn't really end that way but don't know it was just talking about like life as person in body of color in world [laughter] that don't really like person in body of color don't know think it emotional it was like got me thinking yeah um yeah still got like everything else on my mind still got midterm to prepare for [i had to] go to church for minute and there cipher at [redacted] uh i'm not really gonna participate but might as well watch 'cause my homie gonna be in it [inaudible] and feel like earned at least partially some enjoyable friday 'cause [inaudible] 
214,so um feel like the last time did survey was like when was walking back from dinner with my friends to church so hit church um then went to the [inaudible] it didn't really get good until like an hour or two hour in or like an hour and half in like their [inaudible] [inaudible] cool and then one of my friends it like convinced me to go to party at the quad which was decent um yeah mean good by my standards but yeah and then came back knocked out an homework watched tv for little bit went to bed around 400 woke up for work at like 1100 uh left work went to the undergrad recruitment place and did couple of phone calls but it said like it had lot of help earlier in the day so it didn't really need me to do much um and then like looked at my ls lab report but like i've done the majority of like what can do now until like the results come back on tuesday so i'm gonna just worry about that later um just came back from the gym eating dinner so [inaudible] um so yeah probably gonna turn my phone off around 600 and just study like really really hard for my midterms and [inaudible] for upper [inaudible] gonna start with upper yeah my neither of my roommates are here so enjoying yeah having an apartment with nobody else in it and yeah still have an worry [inaudible] like like grades like my life and like uh the bags came to college with and yeah oh and found out that like little girl was mentoring back home got into stanford so guess that was like heartwarming in way for uh me yeah she was legacy but don't know i'm proud of their for what it worth don't know like slightly don't know it just got me thinking but [inaudible] better than one billionaire two yeah all that jazz probably just i'm about to take shower and study 
215,um so guess gotta pick up from yesterday um started studying well really at first it something like after finished meeting took nap when got back uh was able to grind um took nap woke up was able to grind for about like four or five hours it was productive um there lot of stuff on like the second mark for my bio class it was just like why would i've known this it was just it was unnecessary but um figured it out for the most part um i'm going to south by southwest tomorrow so um we're going to office hours on the next day so now we're at sunday went to church it was good service it was like some of that still got somehow was able to keep with me so appreciate that um then hit the gym for like 30-minute run 'cause need more cardio in my life and then felt like was in shape anyway ate so hit the books it was office hours for like three or four hours um right now i'm ch ate again i'm chilling need to go back and finish studying and take care of my housekeeping and stuff um basically i'm becoming more and more okay with like myself my life my own space my own future just couple of things that are like bugging me that have to figure out um i'm here though mostly in good mood 
216,um today was yet another day um monday knocked off my bio midterm lot of the stuff studied was on there which was nice lot of stuff that like thought had studied and prepared for like that was on there that i've even forgotten or like applied wrong but it wasn't that that [inaudible] big thing though so don't know feel decent about it it wasn't like terrible it was just like uh yeah so had class and lab which was like extremely stressful i'm stressed out and then had the exam it wasn't bad [i got] lot of thing right but feel like there was some thing that like got wrong that like didn't need to that like really could [affect] my grade like no matter how generous it choose to be um 'cause like something that like studied or like just glazed over but um we'll see what happens i'll probably stress about my grade later today but like how my chem exam was this morning which is cool it should have prepared me to like do better today but yeah it didn't really happens just read something [inaudible] something [inaudible] so but yeah we'll see 
217,ok so today it was uh don't know hope you guys [inaudible] whatever um woke up had review session with my math teacher it was cool she was really helpful she wanna make sure can do this by myself when hit the midterm there is and then went to class um it was like [inaudible] missed stuff before because like i'd actually been studying for the quiz we have this week i'm hoping i'd do well on that too um yeah and then outside of that have to make sure that like actually prepare for um the midterm that have on thursday and the quiz on sunday i'm thinking about going [inaudible] 'cause they're like actually showing [inaudible] class took nap had workshop for math um and that was followed by um lab but like we didn't actually have lab today we're just like doing some like doing something like [inaudible] so it got knocked out really quickly um so now i'm about to go for run quick lift mostly cardio [inaudible] goldman by dinner tonight and like hadn't heard back [inaudible] he the guys who go here he like the diversity recruiter or whatever ambassador or whatever asked him and he was rude about it but yeah had another friend who like older than me but like he also he he he yeah i'm not going into that i'm just gonna study hopefully like i'm able to get into bed probably like early than was supposed to so 
218,so today was fabulous day in every way except [laughter] my academic life um yeah so woke up uh early had meal with my maths tf because like there is review session later on in the afternoon but like couldn't go to that 'cause had work so like instead just scheduled like two hours of the office hours with her like outside of that time and then slid at in at the end the last 30 minutes but anyway yeah had office hours with her and then like chem lecture um maths it was like two-step but it figured out most of it but it which is hopeful but gotta make sure actually like [inaudible] like capitalize on it on the day of the test um yeah that happening and then um had section for chem but it was like it was something learned in high school that like for some reason never forgot but yeah was able to like to be fine in class and then uh ate went to work knocked out all my chem homework um so like all have left to do well then left work um went to the review session like the last 30 minutes of it um hit the gym with friends so had to split up the work out but finished it um had shower um go to [op] reviewing from my [inaudible] and then gotta knock out um some other stuff 'cause got midterm tomorrow um but yeah it actually like it was pretty good day um last night decided to like tackle my demons demons hasn't replied [laughter] but yeah mean it start [laughter] and then um found well there is like change in the directive for the scholarship i'm on and like part of the scholarship is like money to like excuse me money to like fund internships and like stuff over the summer in case you don't have enough funding which like technically like the [io] fee like is supposed to give me like some stuff to like for [housing] but technically didn't which give me enough wriggle room to secure the bag and get both stipends and then just like hold off on her and then like so that that kind of made me happy and got um won some free celtics ticket on sunday but it like uh don't know uh got to figure out what i'm doing with my life you know like how to fit all the stuff like typically do on sunday like into like life and yeah um 'cause i've already finished my chem pset and like last time come back it said it was gonna be that from 1200 have to figure that out but yeah um pretty good mood have maths midterm tomorrow that like i've been preparing for but it like don't [laughter] it just like there just so much going on it like don don't know it not hard it just lot um so yeah that that there neither here nor there um and got um yeah but it just that but relatively good day 
219,all right so um today was it was actually all right pretty good actually oh stayed up little longer studying than i'd liked to but yeah you know got it in got it done um woke up had class proper and then listening quiz but actually got both of them right or at least both of them mostly right so feel like it [inaudible] thank god probably gonna pull my grade up hopefully um lecture for ls didn't pay attention to that much um [inaudible] an early uh workshop for math or studying friend called me uh we talked for about like an hour should have spent that time asleep but i'm not tired anymore so guess that [inaudible] yourself out studying for midterm right now it in like an hour so about an hour to study mean i've been studying like throughout the day and like yesterday and like for the past two weeks so yeah just like little things throughout the get everything it just should be able to do it once i've studied which is different but at least my nerves is pretty good right now so yeah 
220,all right so i'm doing this right now because like feel like messed up earlier um yeah 'cause took nap instead of like doing anything but yeah today guess have to start with last night took the math midterm wasn't nearly as hard any of the practices but it like all the stuff studied like wasn't on there so like it had like it goods and bads um and then what happened after that oh yeah and then [i just went to the dorm] knocked out like little bit of work didn't do much did like stuff said was gonna get done like that day but yeah didn't really get ahead or whatever then today happened um oh yeah my friend like called me so like was up and then another friend called me asked me like 'cause she she needed help so was [inaudible] for like an hour so didn't go to bed till like 500 had class at 1000 so that was that was interesting didn't fall asleep or anything it was just like and then you know i'm coming out with cold so [all that feel stressed] um yeah so then that happened went to class had meeting had meeting with like an upperclassman he was like he ju don't know it was it was worthwhile so feel like got something out of it that cool though actually get to talk to him um and like learned from him that goods came back to my dorm um well got an burritos from like the [inaudible] club got to my dorm went to sleep for goods like three hour slept through [inaudible] supposed to go to conference in boston but it was like snowing-ish and it also like have cold so didn't feel like going to either of that um yeah my friend had concert so just came back from that but i'm in goods mood like outside of like me being sick right now know why i'm sick it 'cause [inaudible] but um besides being sick um school going okay um other things they're changing which is like don't know if that goods or bads but yeah yeah that that about it 
221,so today was um it was another day i'm gonna start with yesterday guess so yeah finished um going to my friend [inaudible] went back to my dorm watched tv for minute uh yeah it was don't know the episode was pretty good it was basically like it like it completely swi it was great episode it was like horror movie it was cool uh and yeah we support donald glover uh so yeah then did course for like training for um the internship i'm doing so like that took me about hour went to sleep and woke up uh went to work uh work at like 945 so went to work when left that went to the gym started doing laundry that kind of where i'm at right now um started knocking out like things in my email applications and stuff or just things that are sitting there that to do later um so yeah just need to finish that lab report but already started it and then um need to finish like some sets but it not lot it like yeah already started them so there shouldn't be that much left to do probably gonna watch movie or two gonna fold up my laundry yeah 
222,so uh forgetting where did the survey last but um yeah stayed in knocked out thesis knocked out lab report eventually thought i'd watch movie but it was like already 100 in the morning when started so didn't do it um trying to get up [to go to church and] like was already tired so put in just went to [chapel at] like 1100 um and then like from there went to celtics game wasn't like [drunk] in any way [inaudible] like was sick was waking up like every hour like to cough up like mucus and stuff it was it was nasty but i'm good now so that what matters um yeah then after that watched celtics game came back just hit the gym um actually low-key like ahead of schedule hey [redacted] um so after that probably just gonna [shed] some pieces maybe call it night uh doing good also so it good thank you um i'm getting over the cold low-key so that always nice just just [maintaining] guess 
223,um today was pretty good day actually uh knocked out the sets last night later [inaudible] earlier [inaudible] um so yeah got back to my dorm around like 1130-ish uh [inaudible] uh woke up yeah it took me forever to get up and like felt like immersed in sickness but wasn't terrible um yeah was like um i'm sick but the dude like somebody else [inaudible] math so like the dude [inaudible] got me sick [inaudible] don't have to sit by him anymore so that blessing um and don't have to be like rude about it like tell him to like cover his mouth up um yeah so then class ended hit the gym and then went to lab the lab only lasted like an hour and like 20-ish minutes so like that was blessing was able to eat and then picked up um an food picked up shift at work so i'm here right now um yeah because like [inaudible] for like two hour had to figure out how i'm gonna like make my other appointments [inaudible] just like club meetings and stuff but we'll see about that uh probably knock out an homework 
224,today was okay um it started off with me going uh to class late barely getting there on time so got there um and then hit um had lecture for ls and yeah had class took like lay down for while tried to watch movie [inaudible] um had lab um able to knock it out i'm glad it was one of the last ls lab just have presentation next week that need to prepare for but that another story uh so yeah all that happened and then i'm ju don't know just feel really tired it like i'm at the edge of like my cold but still can feel it like it sucks but it just almost done that really like been the big thing oh got my grade back for my ls midterm got it need like but can probably still end up around plus minus but have to really really work hard for that but can see what can do and yeah 
225,so today was another day started the day feeling relatively the same but that whatever um had uh uh finished yesterday the survey yesterday like after woke up from nap so yeah after the nap finished movie workout uh then went to bed at like 400 so [inaudible] no didn't end up getting out of bed till like 1000 had class at 10 and went straight [inaudible] probably the first [inaudible] so went straight uh and then hit the gym tried [inaudible] the first time that was don't know it was different but like the way it felt um and then went to [inaudible] then hit the ocs [inaudible] get advise on studying abroad and all that uh it said optimally can probably do like semester abroad [inaudible] next semester is probably gonna suck in that regard but hey what can you do uh so that happened and then yeah that cool and then there meeting for [inaudible] don't know sometimes feel empty there so many demons in my life and yeah don't know they've been sitting there for while was like and then it like it just happens just like well don't really know what to do at this point [inaudible] i've tried everything school okay-ish probably thought like realized what standard deviation means like in regard to curve so uh yeah kinda changed my perspective uh hopefully uh it won't be that trash [inaudible] finish tomorrow 
226,um today was yet another one of those days it feels like one of those days but it was actually pretty good [laughter] um guess had to pick up yesterday from don't know just didn't get lot of work done don't really remember what happened after those [laughter] low-key had an emotional breakdown but got through it so but yeah those those happened uh woke up went to class one of my sections was canceled so those nice uh knocked out my piece those was easy uh then went to had coup hit the gym had couple meetings to go through uh worked on my project with my group worked on my other project with my group um integrated an piece why it took so long [inaudible] late was able to knock all those out uh it was actually better days like socially or whatever uh stuff still on my mind but i'm still here and yeah just trying to figure things out tomorrow should be fun though 'cause [yani] or whatever coming [yani] [inaudible] my friends are performing and yeah still have to do pre-lab and two questions but besides those should be good 
227,so picking up from think like yesterday relatively late after finished my set and stuff with my friends woke up managed to wake up and get to the gym class some pretty boring work it was [packed] but like after that um ate watched some episode of atlanta and chilled uh went to yard fest it was pretty fun actually most fun i've had in minute [laughter] um so yeah uh appreciate that i'm pretty tired but got to knock some other stuff out tonight but i'll live but um guess it was just dope like again to be like around [inaudible] people and stuff and yeah so that life um no breakdown so far so you know that always good thing and we're here just really ready for the weekend and [inaudible] so and low-key lost my voice too but 
228,so today woke up right around like 1000-ish got to work early started set but was like doing had work but like it was kinda busy so yeah um that happened dad called texted my uncle texted like family back home and stuff and then went to um went to get haircut so need to like don't know yeah uh [i got a] haircut it was nice then went back there was meeting today about like an event that happened yesterday something like went horribly wrong [yeah] it was just like in the community and like it wanted to speak about it so not much [going on] ate i'm gonna knock out an work go to my friend concert and then yeah

230,so today um yeah as said like knocked out those pieces last night um and then like was started studying took mock quiz for ls looked at some notes finished my [western] plan for like project then woke up um moderately on time cla my class [inaudible] was trash didn't learn anything at all math was okay uh hit the gym afterwards and then went to lab it was actually kind of fun lab and it wasn't like hard lab report it was my last lab of the semester for either of my class so i'm glad about those had to lay down and take nap 'cause had like really bad headache there like set in like right before lab um so yeah had to lay down for minute got some food had couple meetings where like i'm bringing work with me 'cause don't feel like having all this piled up at the end so yeah those kind of where my head is at um but yeah i'm just thinking about life and all those 
231,today was really busy but it was an okay day for the most part um had presentation in my lab and [two] [inaudible] um yeah hit the gym with friend ate in between still not really hungry but okay yeah how're you doing um and like besides that it was an okay day don't know feel like had good day lot of work to do kind of worried but yeah i'm i'm chilling [inaudible] so i'm just trying to get to the end of the week to the end of next week just trying to get out of here honestly but came to grips with couple of things yesterday oh yeah by the way [inaudible] because like last night was like the [bmf] elections which took like six hours but feel like it was kind of worth it being there because of like it was don't know it was culturally important or whatever 
232,uh guess got [pickup] yesterday i'm not so sure the last time did think it was after the lab hit the gym with the friend maybe after that um got set it took [probably] longer than thought it was gonna like afterwards like left the [mqc] and went to like go chat with some friend and um [inaudible] was like really did great [inaudible] and it like when did go [inaudible] with friend friend um don't know he he was okay he just like he just started whole bunch of problems like with other people and uh feel bad for like the way handled it uh don't know feel like should just be [inaudible] like feel better if just like handled it better 'cause involved with somebody else who didn't need to be involved yeah 'cause was uh [inaudible] class um it was okay math is getting harder chem it don't [inaudible] lecture but nobody [inaudible] going on chem section um my teacher like taught mus taught us something but was distracted because of other things so didn't really like why is you what um sent him some email just some hour ago so hopefully he sends us like something so can do um and then nothing on math set while was on work on the way to see opera for my class um and got some more homework hopefully i'll start studying for got some exam next week and hopefully my tf like email us so can learn whatever like all this beginning and then can also like um work out the stuff with the people from yesterday but i'll figure it out like talk to everyone individually know it [inaudible] just like feel bad 'cause of the way handled it yeah 
233,so i'm doing this one bit later because like one thing to say [into] another but um today guess back in [redacted] yesterday uh honestly didn't do that much besides like business stuff and just like getting my life together um hit reset [already] yesterday and then went to um today was supposed to go wake up early go to the gym and was like could've but then when woke up was just like let me just get this extra two hours of sleep so like got about like four-hour nap [got up] finished the assignment but then like that night got another eight hours of sleep so feel great [laughter] um had class not [today] that was my last thursday and i'm really fortunate for that um uh i'm probably gonna do like bunch more administrative stuff because like don't have to do my camp psat but arranged meeting with my um chem tf so have time with him tomorrow so like we can study and study the psat and all that 'cause honestly don't know yeah low-key lost but probably just gonna do more administrative stuff check on this psat um after walked from class had phone call meeting went to the gym with friend ate dinner went to woman that [inaudible] right the little [redacted] event that happened um last weekend and don't know bought some stickers for my [inaudible] for um little fashion show 'cause wanted to be able to enjoy that but um yeah just dealing with stuff [legging] out for said friend dealing with grades and stuff and school and extracurriculars are actually low-key starting to pile up and yeah but almost done almost out that what matters
