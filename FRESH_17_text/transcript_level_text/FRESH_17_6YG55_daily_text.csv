6,so today been pretty good day um definitely an improvement from last night with lots of friend drama and guy drama which i'm totally not used to because went to an all-girls school for so long but um mean things seem okay definitely resolidified my friend groups um practicing putting myself first which is definitely something new um trying to understand how college works 'cause kinda just live it out on limb um and you know you're gonna drown if you don't keep up and so need to look at courses because if don't get into with lottery course then i'm kind of screwed 'cause only have three classes so that kind of stressful but it know have faith but also feel like need to get on that um but did get lot of work done definitely didn't think could study with my friends but apparently can and felt really productive today studied for math and my econ homework just doing well and moving forward all this is very new to me so i'm just like getting used to it and stuff but it seems like pretty good day all right 
7,today was [desfrinitely] an interesting day it started out awesome and then didn't get into my class i'm super stressed now ate good food but don't know what to do with my life there no guidance kinda stuck on limb yeah there nothing else really going on i'm just super stressed super super stressed 
8,today got much better than yesterday ended up getting into my lottery class which was awesome made me feel like things worked out and the universe wasn't forgetting about me um sat in my econ classes didn't enjoy any of them um so that was unfortunate um and now i'm really nervous sort of about fail even like econ if i'm still thinking about money and not what gonna make me happy in life and that definitely drives me crazy um but you know did homework with my friends today i'm feeling like i'm with the same people all the time which love um but feel like it could be bad for me later on in life and that not gonna be good but i'm hoping to make more connections have so much to do in so little time and i'm just wondering if this is actually doable and if these teachers are expecting me to do everything or if it supposed to just be like we give you all of this you know do what you want to do from it don't know and this is really frustrating and stressful and guess college is the beginning of being an adult but there just no guidance there it like huge gap between high school and college and don't know how to handle it so that is really really positive just kidding it not um but yeah witness one of my friends having breakdown today i'm surprised didn't have one as well 'cause just really didn't enjoy my classes and that was what was looking forward to but i'm hoping things get better it just the beginning saw my dad today that was good um yeah also had this thing where don't feel homesick at all um and some people do definitely come across that but just don't feel it um feel like there nothing to miss and like where am like the people that i'm with and i'm wondering if that also bad thing and if i'm pushing my feelings away because i'm so busy or don't know but yeah 
9,today was definitely an interesting day spent more time by myself than think have my whole time here um it definitely got lonely it was definitely little bit scary um made me feel pretty isolated didn't love that um but think it something that definitely need to get comfortable with but mean got lot of work done today which is good um took test today was studying for it all day but think uh it paid off which is good i'd been studying yesterday too so it wasn't all cramming but definitely did get nervous last minute and decide to really just do that but got all my homework done for today which is good um let see yeah had really good interaction with my friend today you know told her how lonely got and stuff um and how was nervous that would be that person in the group that we had just sort of left because they put us through lot of emotional stress and didn't wanna be burden on anybody um but yeah she was really supportive really helpful you know reminding me that that not who am i'm very different person um i'm also nervous about classes don't love everything that i'm doing but it is the first week so it could just be don't know just not great but i'm hoping things get better um and i'm still grappling with this idea of do wanna be happy or do wanna secure job or can do both or you know but um yeah that definitely something that been hanging over my head um and is really scary actually um and it not something that can ask anybody for help for which is also nerve-wracking because i'm so indecisive and don't do anything by myself but here to adulting 
12,pretty good day today got lot of work done i've been to [redacted] initiation which was cool um yeah had some time by myself had some time with friends today felt kinda weird it was like lot of stuff to do in little time but got lot of work done and was able to work ahead of time which is important but [inaudible] practicing that is really hard but yeah not bad not bad today 
13,had pretty okay day today um didn't get as much work done as i'd wanted to still trying to figure out how to do what work when um but yeah had an interview today also don't know how that went for consulting but we'll see i'm just coming back from the library now it 145 and was 10 o'clock girl three weeks ago here am coming home at o'clock in the morning from the library but oh well i'm liking the readings i'm learning [inaudible] yeah 
14,interesting day today it was nice doing homework today because was productive yesterday and today so things feel little bit better um got most of one application done still have another one to do it kind of like i'm drowning but like my face is like right at the surface so had air but like you know um you know one wind could really just kill me and i'm kinda nervous and feel like i'm like uh floating but i'm really nervous about econ i'm nervous about you know being on top of things and doing things right and like applying to too much yet not enough and i'm really just trying to figure out this whole experience also coming from an all-girl school social stuff is kind of nuts like guys are thing apparently and like don't know just don't know how to take social cues and that very damaging so that something that stresses me out but yeah it happening 
15,today was pretty good day um don't know you could say like worked with different people definitely worked by myself today and was productive finished applications am super worried about extracurriculars there just so much to do but the comping process makes it like once you get denied there nothing left and that really scary um but yeah i'm hoping everything goes well just have to sort of have faith guess 'cause at this point have no idea what to do um homework is going okay not amazingly um this is never-ending cycle but it okay um yeah i'd give today like not great but not terrible 
16,today was an awful day um [and ain't] the first day that have come in um don't know just come to terms with my actuals emotions how i'm feeling how i'm not doing well feel like don't belong here like i'm not good enough getting rejected from everything and find myself being jealous that my friends got into programs that didn't and i'm so proud of them but at the same time i'm wondering what wrong with me what am missing you know why don't have drive why why am always left out and it super super frustrating because don't know what wrong with me and if did know would change it and just like want to know but feel like things happen for reason and i've always believed that but at this point feel like can't anymore because there no way that i'm supposed to go through this much turmoil this much stress this mus much like self-degradation every single day it just hard to come to terms with my reality when it sucks so much um and did that today and it hurt me lot didn't even trust myself to go to the bridge and just relax because didn't know what would do that really stressful to think about um and don't know if i've been low like that before 'cause block things out in order to forget them but i'm just like super stressed and feel like i'm not supposed to be here and that this place wasn't meant for me which it wasn't but don't know what to do with myself think really might go into really deep depression here and it gonna be an awful experience 
17,today was pretty great day got initiated for the [redacted] that was awesome um yeah hadn't felt like young again you know was dancing with friends went to party um danced guessed whatever they call it here um but also like went to class and got some work done and had an okay meal um but uh guess something that stands out to me today was my connections with people not only did get to meet great people in the [redacted] initiation and like having found my big siblings and things like that but also got to connect with friends um that like met outside of abhwa that were guys actually and guess they're pretty normal which is interesting um it just like i'm able to open up to them where opened up to one person today and just saying that like you know don't mean to come across as like trying to avoid people or or upset or or just like distant it just don't want to do the wrong thing because of where i've come from but which is going to an all-girls school for eight years like just wanna make sure that i'm doing you know th-the right things and not overstepping anything or making people feel uncomfortable because i'd never wanna do that especially because know what it feels like um so that was actually really nice really really grateful and like i'm sort of excited about these relationships to see where they go and stuff um but yeah also feeling like definitely not good enough still um my friends are all better than me and i'm so proud of them but at the same time i'm wondering what did wrong and if belong here but you know things are happening but yeah 
18,had pretty great day today had lunch with my dad hung out with some friends made some new friends and really meaningful connections which i'm really happy about am feeling okay with my extracurricular commitments and i'm just gonna be happy with who am and gonna do this homework one step at time it is not gonna be easy and that okay but i'm i'm gonna do what can as can and as much as can yeah i'm i'm actually really happy with today today was was pretty awesome so i'm very very happy made better friends with the guys and basically they have my back and they're not like intimate or anything but just wanna be my friend which is great and it just like don't know maybe have different outlook had some really good discussions with people and it just felt normal like almost forgot that they weren't girls which was cool but yeah i'm i'm happy i'm pretty happy today 
19,pretty okay day today um had lot of work to do got some of it done um starting to [inaudible] in the morning had new experiences um let me think yeah got to see [redacted] today which was awesome she been gone for two days which was really long time feel like we've gotten so close like just like my friend [inaudible] this past couple of weeks that um small amount of time feels like lot and that definitely really interesting how it like this is the new world this is like my group of people now that i'm with basically 247 and actually like like it and feel excited about it and feel like i'm actually have [inaudible] [constant] which is different from home um but it really noticeable and things are different which is little bit scary but yeah 
20,interesting day today um lot of things went wrong um basically feeling super incompetent about everything that do i'm not really happy with myself or proud of myself or the programs that i've gotten into uh just one which is really exciting um just kidding it not um yeah my friends were definitely there to support me though and they're definitely having well one of them at least is having similar issues with just feeling like they're not their best self not really good enough for this place and things like that um definitely cried today just couldn't keep it in just feel like i'm not enough not good enough will never be and it hard to be to suck really um and so my mom is giving my cat away which is great you know just icing on the cake um yeah to cope with my emotions ordered some insomnia cookies my friend got me ice cream 'cause was crying outside over like everything yeah basically it just really sucks to suck and when people say it it just seems like joke but it very painful process and almost feel depressed like am very unhappy with myself and don't like myself right now so yeah 
21,thought things are getting better um that was like getting my homework done started to get back on top of things then got my [ec grade] back today for my first [inaudible] and got 792 and feel like crap um and think everybody else is doing really really well and and getting these great grades and here am can't even get anything good on my [ec] thing and it like don't understand what i'm doing wrong still like i'm trying so hard i'm putting in effort and it like it not enough and don't understand why i'm here if can't succeed um it just really bothers me and today like had moment where couldn't even take it like went to the river and sat and stared at the water because i'm so disappointed in myself all the time um yeah basically hate myself and academically think i'm trash socially i'm trash uh and want to stay positive when think of been known as like bubbly person um in my friend group but like lately don't know can't even like stay positive about these things because every day it like something new that just tearing me down and like don't wanna talk to my parents about it because don't want them to worry think i'm not doing well and then think i'm gonna fail like they always do but like don't know where to go and like can't do it anymore and feel like i've been able to deal with stress and like not doing well but this is another level where can't even look at myself right now and like like really hate myself and i'm so disappointed in everything that do my peers are doing so great and wonder what i'm missing um so i'm just trying to get around that today i'm doing really bad don't wanna kill myself but like there nothing that makes me wanna stay anymore so i'm just like really tired and now just go to sleep so don't have to feel any emotions it just everything is going wrong my mom wants to give my cat away can't get good grades can't make the right decisions socially academically i'm not doing well can't stand out and when do i'm wrong and it like why is econ so like not even hard just like not made for me and don't know i'm i'm really really really really stressed 
22,pretty interesting day today um didn't really have too much stress from my friend group barely saw them um but definitely had some stresses with my parents and them dealing with me not being there and my cat et cetera um but yeah today was kind of weird day didn't love the day actually really like um like being with my friends so that was unfortunate but got like some work done and did okay i'm going to bed at an almost reasonable time so that good but i'm just really really tired haven't been getting enough sleep i'm like not aggravated with my parents but just um coming to terms with the fact that now they need to know that didn't have happy childhood but don't wanna break their hearts um 'cause know they worked hard but yeah just those types of stresses 
23,pretty good day today um got some great work done met with the study group went to some great office hours and actually understood stuff which is really exciting so i'm definitely gonna try to switch groups um just kinda felt accomplished today like did something and got it done and feel confident about what it like um didn't see my friends as much today but when did see them at the end it was really great it was like reward which is awesome um yeah mean it was definitely different type of day like was definitely alone lot like just doing homework and stuff but got all the work done that needed to get done which was huge have nothing to do tomorrow that due tomorrow so i'm happy with that i'm very very happy 
24,pretty good day today [coming] [inaudible] my phones didn't do as much work as wanted to um but was able to be there socially for somebody else for multiple people and think that really important so i'm kind of okay with that um yeah mean it was pretty casual day was definitely more relaxed than usual and didn't have lot of social interactions until after my classes i'm feeling in pain like i'm literary sick um and like my intestines hurt but don't have time to go to health services so that won't be happening soon um yeah yeah i'm just trying to balance school work with social life 'cause do need to [inaudible] my time 
25,pretty good day um until the football game which was awesome got to see my friends from home which was great um definitely had new social experience today where don't know if i'm attracted to people or like if i'm attracted to specific person but like the fact that my roommate kind of like came in and kind of meddled with something that had or was working towards maybe unintentionally did not appreciate that whatsoever um this one was getting around that you know didn't really feel protective of that person until this happened um so yeah don't know how to quantify this experience or feeling or like anything um but yeah that definitely stressed me out bit um discovered new friends through that or like better friends should say um so out of the social tension or like academic stress like think can deal with but the social stress is something very new um definitely dealing with body image issues right now just staring into the mirror um feel [inaudible] which is exciting just kidding it not um but yeah really love my friends hoping we stay great friends 'cause really trust them yeah 
26,pretty good day today um relieved some stresses that was feeling before did little bit of self-care today and got things that needed or just wanted like my phone and um some makeup that i'm going to learn how to use uh also um good connections with my friends um both guys and girls um yeah definitely making progress again and building confidence think and and being okay with you know things that are supposed to be the way they are um when it comes to like getting into things and programs and stuff so i'm gonna do the one program that got into and i'm gonna do my best at it i'm gonna do my very best and i'm gonna be great in it um and that how i'm gonna improve myself um so i've been like thinking about it lot and you know just telling myself to apply for everything now because nothing really given so it something have to deal with but definitely working on it and making steps to get better improve myself and just not put too much emphasis on like social stresses and just really get my schoolwork done um yeah 
27,um today was pretty interesting day went to reading class by myself instead of with my two friends um they didn't end up going this morning but felt fine actually sometimes feel freer to express myself academically when i'm not around friends um so which is kind of weird um other than that definitely did get to see them did program at the iop today where basically sat and listened to lady talk and people asked questions um something else uh socially um guess just this guy like don't know what he wants because don't know anything um but nah he wants to like hang out um and don't know what that means and i've been supported really well by my friends um and they've just been sort of helping me understand how feel trying to figure out how he feels and just get around that so that definitely been something that been sitting on the back of my mind other things that have been sitting on the back of my mind are exams and midterms that are coming up um but it all just feels like blur in the near future which is also not good um and need to plan that out and that like stressing me just little bit um but yeah those are most of my social stressful interactions 
28,pretty interesting day um had lot of work to do still have work to do not done super super unfortunate feeling um struggling with the econ still but things are getting better just have like so much work to do and so little time and it not even like wasn't productive today like was and i'm not getting enough sleep and i'm getting sick so it like there nobody you can go to because everybody says college is so hard and stuff and like they think we know what we're walking into and we don't and just like feel like super unprepared but also like it not doable can't do everything and it kind of sad and little scary um didn't really see lot of my friends day was doing lot of my homework and would've hoped that if had spent day like that it would've at least paid off and it didn't so that was unfortunate um yeah 
29,tough day today had super super super heavy load of homework still needed to do things today that didn't get to um i'm really really struggling with econ feel completely unprepared um think this may be one of the worst decisions i've ever made and even with tutor now i'm going in on my second meeting tomorrow can't do the set by myself failed the actual unit review thing today and the lady let me pass 'cause could talk through it guess but like i'm just so unprepared and then there like no help and i'm drowning and that really stressing me out the fact that i'm walking home at 230 and i'm not even home yet just like this is really awful um but yeah that really where all my stress is lying right now can't really think about anything else some like guy problems are like they're miniscule really compared to my academics at this point um but yeah am so stressed so stressed 
30,rocky day today lots of emotions felt like couldn't do econ but got it done best work maybe not got math done um let me see just had some interesting interactions with friends um guys new but feel like i'm making really good connection that i'm really proud of and happy with yeah and i'm really tired and need to go to bed and should've gone to bed but didn't so here am all right yeah 
31,pretty okay day today feeling really sick um socialized with different group of people today that found stimulated me bit more um which really appreciate and it makes me kind of rethink what i'm doing who i'm being friends with and how i'm allocating my time among those groups um i'm also stressed about mid-terms didn't study as much as i'd hoped to today but yeah need to get cracking so i'm organizing everything in the process but yeah i'm just really asking god for help right now 'cause i'm so so so nervous but yeah 
32,another interesting day um spent time with my mom um which was good she has been expressing lot of feelings about me not spending enough time with her pushing her away or whatever so worked on that today and and some parts of my mind were like you really need to study you really need to do work but other parts of me were like this is really important and you really need to work on this relationship as well and i'm really struggling with balancing school work and and social life and social life is lot but i'm i'm trying and i'm really nervous for these midterms and keep thinking about the studying that have to do and don't quite know how to do it but i'm asking god for help because at this point really don't even know what to do and feel like after these first ones i'll be prepared and like i'll know and went to the bureau of study counsel so i'm ahead of the game for the next time 'cause don't like feeling this way um yeah went to party tonight and came back at reasonable time but was talking with the same guy again till late at night don't know what that means feel like don't even want to admit it to myself so yeah but mean pretty positive day socially would say 
33,pretty chill day just did lot of homework saw my parents for quick second and they dropped off some things but wanna get to bed early i'm so tired and i'm sick and need to care for myself also need to study even i'm putting my homework first today because it important um upcoming events that are on my mind are my math midterm which is tuesday my ec midterm which is wednesday um avoided some people today 'cause just wanted to focus um so like stayed with my usual comfort group but didn't branch out bit like usually do to my other phone group um and yeah i'm definitely struggling with things people wanting to be with me hanging out with me and don't wanna be there 'cause feel like have important things to do but then i'll turn around and go with different friend group so don't really know but yeah pretty i'd say it was pretty laid-back day actually 
34,um pretty big day today or or tomorrow guess have my math exam tomorrow i'm studying for feeling okay about um lot of new social things arising person i've been hanging out with expressed that he like me today it wasn't really in the way that had expected it was more of surprise so something that i've heard from everybody else except him um so yeah while was doing my work it just sort of like came up again and then he like took me outside and then spoke for little bit and i'm little disappointed um and don't even know why don't know how to read these situations but like guess wanted there to be something and and wanted to move forward but the fact that i'm not the reason why it wasn't happening um is unfortunate think for me in my opinion and so little bit sad about that and don't know why i'm sad like basically it just like he very interested in me or whatever but like he he wants to make sure of what back at home and just like if he gonna have relationship or not um yeah and and and don't feel like like i'm not enough or anything but guess it was just disappointing really don't know how to feel so here am struggling as usual as usual 
35,pretty uh lonely day today didn't feel lonely but realized later that was alone for lot of the day um just di-did lot of studying uh got lo lot of work done um but yeah tried to focus on my work today was getting distracted lot about the situation with this guy but it don't know what gonna happen and have faith that things will work out the way god wants them to but right now just really wanna do well in my mid-terms and don't know how feel about the math and don't feel amazing um but did definitely know things which was great um but yeah it just makes me more excited for the next ones in terms of like actually being prepared and like getting my life together and planning ahead or whatever 'cause definitely didn't do that and it backfiring just bit so yeah and i'm just ready to restart and it hasn't even ended yet so it little bit nerve-racking but hopeful 
37,pretty okay day today um spent most of my time by myself um did really well in my classes today think which was awesome only had one class today but we had section as well as lecture and think did pretty well um yeah felt productive by myself but was happy no but then got around my one of my friends' and my dorm whatever you wanna call it house and started to feel like disappointed in myself like i'm not doing enough still which is really unfortunate um but yeah so thought hanging around my friend would make me happier but it made me feel little bit less efficient which was surprising because i'm always happy for people when they do great things and stuff so it was streak of jealousy that didn't like yet here it was um but yeah did some homework by myself today and with friend i'm gonna start doing homework by myself little bit more just 'cause think need to get comfortable with being with myself 'cause haven't been by myself in while so yeah just very [inaudible] day for where i'm comfortable 
38,pretty interesting day today worked lot on my essay that wished started earlier when finally felt was making progress went to office hours and basically had to restart so started worrying on have to go to bed 'cause i'm going home tomorrow and making an early trip and really need to get some sleep um but i'm nervous about this paper i'm super nervous about it and worked on it basically all day but yeah i'm just really stressed about that sometimes kind of the only thing could think about unfortunately uh are there social interactions was pretty much alone today um some of my guy friends came over by surprise tonight felt it was interesting um interesting occurrences with those people but really do like them and enjoy their presence so it was fine um and saw my girlfriends today my normal group my home basically um yeah so saw like most people today just not as much as usually do and did like all my homework by myself so that was new was it as productive mean occasionally i'm really focusing on the paper guess but yeah it was difficult to grasp well was really just struggling with that work crying and felt the usual but yeah really wild day 
39,still working on this paper that is due at 10 o'clock tomorrow thinking i'm just gonna wake up in the morning not allow myself to do anything no fun no friends no food till finish this essay 'cause i'm really over it don't wanna do it anymore it all i've been thinking about haven't done any other homework should've been getting ahead this weekend but i'm not really frustrated with myself 'cause feel like can't limit myself when it comes to certain people and that really really hard but yeah basically my life sucks and i'm terrible at self-control in social situations 
40,um today spent most of my time by myself um finishing an essay that was due at 10 o'clock tonight finished it at like 300 um but then had to like cut out words and like put in the the formatting and citations in um but yeah so like it was kind of productive but at the same time wish had done it and started it earlier really don't like finishing things on the day it due um so today is gonna be well today was lesson guess tomorrow is gonna be productive don't um like having to cram work um so tomorrow i'm gonna do just lot so don't have to do that um other things didn't get to see all of my friends today so ended up [inaudible] didn't get to see him today but um yeah also i've noticed um my friend uh she told us that she was depressed little while ago um and feel like know little bit about that just because of where i've come from um and that like you have good days and you have bad days and and things like that and think i've dabbled in depression actually quite bit but don't really know how to help her and like she doesn't want help but want her to be happy you know um and know what bothering her and it her boyfriend who just like is not being great person um but guess it like not in my range of authority and can't really tell her how to do these things because i've never done it but just like feel terrible and wanna you know she really close friend and care about her so that been something that i've been thinking about but yeah that just been in the back of my mind sitting 
41,um today spent most of my time by myself doing my homework went to bed pretty early last night so woke up little bit early but got 11 hours or almost 11 hours of sleep which is great um so felt really good really needed that worked on homework for one class all day today it was that much um it was over 70 pages of reading and other articles and had to write stuff about it um which is atypical but i'm sure why it quite took me so long um today but um now that i'm done with my midterms am try well not really have more coming up um but really wanna get ahead so i'm going to try to get ahead within these two days um and just get ahead in econ and math wanna study wanna do really really well on this next test because didn't do on the last one um and i'm just really determined i'm trying to remember who am so um just read card birthday card from my friend from home and it says something along the lines of can't way to see the things you do you're incredible um i'm just trying to remember who that is and find my drive um and think with some of my friends do find that and with others don't um but yeah upcoming events that have been on my mind are really just future exams now i'm just really trying to get ahead of schedule that my goal um 'cause don't like doing things last minute or the day before they're due um yeah today was also with my friend while she was talking to her boyfriend things aren't going well and that was really interesting to see because don't really know how normal relationships work um thanks to what my parents had so yeah that was pretty much my day mostly by myself felt productive but just as productive when was with my friends so we'll see 
42,um pretty interesting day spent lot of my time by myself again um just doing homework reading studying trying to get ahead did little bit um not as much as i'd like to but definitely made progress um yeah just trying to prepare for my next mid-term which is on 19th um so have some time but really really wanna get cracking on it 'cause need to do all that wanna do uh um so i'm just really trying to focus on school now and and get ahead um that basically my biggest priority let me see what else yeah saw lot of my friends today had one-on-one with the ones that usually don't um but it was fun and you know just seeing my friends do well in school get good things i'm like obviously good grades do come to me but guess don't like broadcast them but it feels like they just come to other students at much higher rate than they do for me so that been something that been kind of knocking at my academic confident but um i'm trying to get around that i'm really trying to work on that but yeah 
43,another interesting day today um had definitely had some time to do some homework right by myself which did also ended up doing little bit of homework with my friends um let see um other than that mostly heavy with classes today today had the most classes um that felt really good that did some work on my um tea set and things started to come together which has never happened before in econ so that really positive um let see some things that are on my mind are my ma my math exam which is thursday that i'm trying to study for earlier but every time tell myself i'm gonna study for it have like no time so it really unfortunate um yeah just seeing how my friends react differently to stress one friend barely reacts at all she has midterm tomorrow didn't really know and my other friend had midterm today and you could definitely see how stressed she was about it for while um yeah i'm just trying to really get ahead of the game and do really well other things um went to my guy friend house tonight or like dorm whatever you wanna call it um and basically just had like normal conversation at first but then bit more conversation about like what going on with us guess and like how he not really ready for relationship which was interesting don't feel mad or sad or happy about it i'm just sort of there seems like it would be my reality as soon as feel like i'd be willing to possibly you know if somebody else is not so yeah just really interesting me trying to grapple with that and understand if even want relationship if i'm ready for it don't know how that gonna go with school so yeah 
44,pretty interesting day today um had type of social interaction that was more academic-based than like what it usually is where it just like me struggling with my friends or having really good time with my friends um instead we had some really interesting discussions about race and identity within uh education in my class and spoke up about that and there were like couple of problematic things so spoke to lot of students about it especially the tf spoke up in lecture um so that was huge um other things sat with different group of people today um at lunch and definitely don't fit into that group but think it really interesting and really enjoyed being there because they're so comfortable with theirselves and they're so free-going and confident and wanna encapsulate that and find that confidence within myself um yeah did lot of work today catching up or really staying little bit behind but yeah it getting better today was really good interesting day 
45,um interesting day today failed my econ midterm um so that was interesting um had really good heart to heart with group of my friends today all of us really just talked about how we were struggling with what and learned more about my friends um but also like got deeper understanding of my own emotions and figured out how lost was and and these tears were falling from my eyes but didn't know what they were coming from um so then had another heart to heart with my friend um and he gave me some really good insights as well and i've just lost hope um and i've lost myself here so i've been trying to find that um upcoming things on my mind are my next midterms homework getting on top of my game just doing really well and also just keeping faith and understanding this process and taking things for what they are but also not just being complacent and failure um yeah this is sort of new day for me and and new lifestyle this is gonna be the beginning yeah 
46,pretty low-key day today got little bit of work done went shopping um went to party tonight got somewhat closer to male friend but think like kinda destroyed it unintentionally of course um as usual so don't know what i'm doing um but yeah was having good day now i'm pretty um know i'm gonna be distraught for like the next uh at least day and half so just gonna get over that um let see social interactions events that are upcoming events and studying need to study for my math midterm keep saying i'm gonna do the practice exam and don't um so that really annoying um yeah the party today was really interesting and i'm still out with this guy loved it it felt great it felt right but of course had screwed it up and was screwing up school so really really really really really need to do well so i'm gonna focus on that and just let things happen because cannot live with this recurring sadness of failure just washing over me all day every day just need to do something right and at this point the only thing that feel like could potentially do right is something academically so that what i'm gonna work towards but um yeah definitely pretty emotional right now 
47,um pretty interesting day today uh got like good amount of work done even though thought wasn't being very productive ended up really turning that around um caught up with econ did my [math] piece at friday night so yeah mean maybe it wasn't very productive today because only did econ but did read multiple chapters and take notes so yeah uh uh um definitely looking over social struggles that i'm having with specific people and like relationships and relationship building and and feel like at this point am just going to take the relationships that have now that know are great and then valuing lot um i'm gonna keep those ones as they are and then for other ones i'm just gonna put my schoolwork first know they happen if they happen if they don't they don't um yeah i'm definitely struggling socially but i'm really pushing it to the side because don't care and don't want to care um but yeah so that definitely happening but other than that went to brunch today and that was really when saw my friends and then at dinner saw them again but most of my time it was by myself yeah not bad 
48,had an okay day today did most of my work by myself it was pretty productive learning that don't know how to study so that was exciting um had breakfast with my friends today had dinner with my friends lunch with different group of people um definitely feeling some type of way about certain individuals now really just don't want to hang out with them don't want to be around them um and that definitely new because i've been trying to be very positive about everything but i'm really over it um let see no really spent most of my time by myself today it was super busy kind of really structured day with just like one thing to go to after the other but really liked it and it made me feel um kind of like how it used to be where had structure so had to do my work and it made me be lot more productive and really appreciated that so yeah 
49,pretty okay day today um pretty busy going back to this thing with heavy schedule lots of things to do um it was pretty productive at night it bit of later night than i'd hoped um but i'm still getting to bed didn't spend lot of time with friends today until later tonight and it was only one person so definitely saw less people but just coping with stress and putting structure back into my life um with like making sure go to things while at the same time you know trying to fit in social things and then studying and not pushing people away or cutting ties um other than that yeah just really focused on lot of my academic things today and left it at that and it didn't feel bad wasn't super super happy but did like the structure so yeah um what else no literally just did school today and that was it but didn't have to do any homework last minute today and that felt really really good 
50,um had an okay day today it wasn't very productive on top of that lost elections for [redacted] um took math practice the exam today did pretty well told myself that that wouldn't be the last thing do and nor would take it as reflection of why i'm studying even though it went well because should review still and it was different material 'cause it was different test um and yet didn't went to bed quite later than hoped um and don't feel stressed like feel like emotionally hurt like inside but don't really know how to like don't know release it spoke to my friend today over facetime and cried to her because i'm not good enough for this place um and that i'm inadequate for everything that do and everything thought knew about myself i've failed that here so um that definitely struggle um yeah today like it was just busy day academically and at the same time still feel like i'm stagnant in my work but yeah also my friend was talking to her boyfriend over facetime and he seemed really great and amazing and was like wow wish had that you know um then realized that well after she hung up she was like think he gonna cheat on me or like whatever and it was so different from how the phone call seemed and that was fear that remember from my childhood and it made me nervous guess but like also while they're on facetime like was talking to her boyfriend friend and like we're really hitting it off or whatever and it just like they're so much around me lot of it that can't take advantage of simply because i'm not good enough but um there are so many risks as well though and that little bit scary to me but essentially today was another bad day where all of my thoughts are justified and that i'm not good enough for anything here and am not who thought was 
51,um pretty okay day today did some cram reading uh this morning unfortunately and but i'm glad did it it was really helpful for the class um then studied for my or uh like reviewed for my midterm little bit and took it and feel really good and loved that feeling of doing it and after doing it where it like okay i've seen this before can do this i'm confident and it and i've been progressing like for more than one day before so that was something that really gave me uh um peace of mind and so that something that i'm gonna try to practice now um also um let see um was let in on some struggles that my friends are having some my guy friends are having with girls guess that was eye-opening in that like there are lot of people with different plans for life and lifestyles here and like abstinence and things like that and think lot of people are breaking under this pressure and that they're not sure who they are or that they can even stay [through] the morals that they've created here because there so much going on and sometimes you're so deep in things that you can't really see where you're going and um that effect think has tremendous um amount of weight on your shoulders um especially when it has to do with things like religion and like really sexual tendencies and um yeah this whole like love life romantic thing it like it gets me little bit sad sometimes that don't have anybody um but also like know people are out there and it gonna be tough and but do need to have that experience so it just really interesting the things that have been on my mind rea like academics are really important but at the same time used to feel like i'm missing something that i'd love to have so we'll see 
52,interesting day i'm really tired ready to go to bed um yeah just like didn't do as much work as hoped to today had some interesting conversations with my friends um regarding other friends that have and you know whether those friends should be friendship should be like stronger relationships in the future and like romantic relationships and how dangerous that may be for me um so like appreciate my friends looking out for me of course um and think some time they're like that dose of reality that need but also like really wanna feel wanted and think do feel lonely but like i'm surrounded by friends but want to be wanted romantically so that something that i'm grappling with um uh yeah just need to be little bit more productive tomorrow lot more productive actually so i'm going to go to bed 
53,pretty okay day today was not as productive as i'd hoped struggling with math set we had total new topic that have never learned and it quite difficult um had lot of experience today with males went out with my male friend and his male friend who is interested in me um thankfully was able to bring one of my friends along 'cause didn't feel like was gonna be okay by myself so that was really great um something else that happened today yeah just like really wanted to do my work and spend lot of time on organizing how was gonna do my work um but then didn't actually do lot of it um until got back home um but like feel better now that it like pretty much organized and done and can just go and do things and like trust that it the right time to do it and stuff um but yeah i'm just like really not feeling good and think not sleeping is catching up to me and i'm like shaking right now so yeah 
54,um spent most of the day by myself today just doing work um working my calendar trying to figure out what work to do and realizing that definitely still need help with this process of organizing all the work that do and moving it back and it feels helpful little bit but i'm also definitely stressed about it um so i'm trying to get around that but did some work that due tuesday today so that was great um which isn't that far out but it feels farther out also definitely sick quite sick actually and think need to go to health services um have pretty bad cough ne used my inhaler today which am not as mad at getting worse so that definitely problem um other things that did today went to the gym uh really spent most of my time by myself but was doing homework and found that lot of the work that had to do it was me like giving myself incentives to do my work so i'd like give myself like treat or whatever after doing certain amount of work um which is terrible 'cause don't know if that means have drive or don't have drive um but other than that um it really just me today mostly and then had like dinner with all of my friends and did like tiny bit of homework with re with them but yeah 
55,um spent most of the day by myself today attempting to do work um i'm pretty sick went to the health center today but [inaudible] 'cause felt like had lot of work to do 'cause went to get my flu shot but then you shouldn't get your flu shot while you're sick so decided against that um but yeah basically spent lot of time doing the same piece of homework today and so like was happy because had finished the work that was due tomorrow li-like at really good time like seven something but still have lot of other work to do and i'm still struggling with econ and like i'm like getting better think but i'm definitely still behind or like not where i'd like to be so that something that i'm struggling with other than that just like went to dinner with my friends and then did homework in the women center and that was probably the most productive think we've ever been which was awesome but yeah i'm just really sick and need to get more sleep 
56,pretty lonely day today spent most of my time on the homework grind just doing work um going to study hours to realize that study hours are not there um but yeah i'm like getting ahead of my work but i'm still not as ahead as i'd like to be like really wanna be studying for econ but feel like there no time to and now that have like my schedule organized and stuff still don't think there time which is little bit nerve-racking um it actually quite nerve-racking but yeah today was was lonely like got good amount of work done was happy uh not quite and so that definitely something that i'm struggling with um yeah but other than that did end up seeing one friend today oh no couple of friends today um but you know it definitely things are changing and not like badly or positively it just that like with school life like balancing schoolwork and social life it really hard when you're always surrounded by your friends so that something i'm struggling with but yeah 
57,um today spent most of the time by myself um knowing that had an event tonight that was from 800 to 1000 that was socializing made sure to do all my homework that was due tomorrow yesterday um and get some work done today that due tuesday although didn't do lot of the work that due friday i'm still really uh struggling with econ and feel like just stare at the problems and don't know what to do with them mean i've been slowly moving through but definitely not at pace that'll get me done by myself by noon on friday or by 1100 on friday um so that the [inaudible] math is getting hard really fast everything just changing um but yeah really spent most of the time by myself feeling like i'm not having enough time to do my work and now not only is it family weekend my friends wanna hang out um my family wants to hang out at the same time and like don't even know what going on i'm just going day by day which is mo like scary and don't like it because there so much happening all the time um so definitely have this stress around me that just like go go go go go even when you're ahead of the game you're behind studied really hard for my math exam um got it back today and only got an 87 was like are you kidding me so out of 66 points so like the points small loss in points makes bigger impact on the grade but thought i'd get an at least but that okay um yeah just like going along this thing that we had tonight was um couple of like black students got together seniors brought some freshmen together and it was good group of boys and girls just you know hanging out and chilling and kinda liked it was like kickback so we just sat there there was alcohol there didn't drink any but like someone gave me sip of their like wine or something but that was it really didn't want that um but didn't feel pressured either which was really awesome um sat there and drank my juice and it was great um but yeah no that was definitely met lot of new kids today don't really know or like five or six kids guess um and yeah that about it 
58,um so the day is basically done saw none of my close friends today um except for one that saw during um econ review for [p-set] we have due tomorrow and that was pretty short-lived as well um i'm feeling really terrible definitely miss my friends today um but like i'm quite sick my body not healing itself um my skin is turning to trash um feel really fat pretty sure i'm getting my period but like nothing happening 'cause i'm irregular but nobody believes me and my symptoms for my period are pretty bad and know they're gonna get bad and think should be on birth control but don't even know what resources to go to get that here um yeah basically my health is just like really bothering me right now and like my workload i'm not happy with it either so yeah today was very different day and didn't feel happy at one point but did speak to both my parents today um saw my cousin from [redacted] had dinner with her and my dad we spoke little bit it was like little bit awkward but not really um that just kind of how we are but yeah just don't even know how to feel about today yeah couldn't even be productive because had so much stuff to do but now i'm done with all my work i'm just gonna take shower and go to bed but yeah 
59,um pretty okay day today saw my parents um we hung out for bit and realized that miss them little bit wasn't sure if it i'd like guess miss the idea of having parents and like not that they like do things for me but other people were like i'm with my family or like met my friend little brother today and he was like such cute person to know you know it such great connection and was like yeah guess do miss my family miss being around them but like wouldn't want to be in the same place that was before either way so like it just like weird thing to think about because don't really get homesick and it not really homesickness that i'm feeling it more of this like like you guys don't talk to you guys lot um other thing is went out tonight wasn't as productive as i'd liked to be today um got an econ tutor most amazing person so good i'm so excited and uh went out tonight realizing that like do like this guy and like even though don't think he is quite like perfect for me like want someone in my life and want him to be that person because trust him but wonder if if want him to be that person 'cause he the only person that know but like you know so definitely struggling with that but it is what it is 
60,um today was stressful was not super fun but mean it was okay it parents' weekend so was just with my family lot and was reminded basically how glad am to be here not living with my family um but just mentally straining day i'm just like mentally exhausted emotionally exhausted and didn't go out tonight 'cause just didn't think i'd be able to have good time in the state that i'm in and didn't wanna spread that to anybody else um but [redacted] my friend called me after to make sure was okay and stuff and that was great um also hung out lot with male friend my parents met that male friend vice versa as in his parents met me they really liked each other or no they really like me my parents really like him but you know here we are not making moves with each other he not moving forward um that struggling that something i'm struggling with just wish he would do something forward um yeah that something that just been on the back burner for while got no work done today at all so that was awesome just just completely awesome but yeah feel super prepared for the week do feel confident with myself was basically fat-shamed all day so uh my parents want me to go the gym every day my mum has sent me meal plan uh no sweets just water um so yeah don't know what i'm gonna do but will be at the gym tomorrow morning so exciting 
61,um pretty interesting day today to-today was the last day of parents weekend think don't know my parents were here they had this you know big talk with me about um that i'm not quite being my best self here and should get more involved in opportunities and just remember who am and not to get lost in these things and not to just uh be part of organizations that are all black need to make white friends also need to exercise and just like lot of things and like think kind of needed it little bit um so like i'm not mad at them or anything but didn't knew it needed to happen but really wasn't ready for it to happen but um yeah mean that was just me basically [inaudible] to get my [inaudible] and they were just like stop hanging out with your friends so much and [inaudible] get involved email your buddy blah blah blah so mean i'm really grateful in the end and when i'm going to be new person things may be little bit different in terms of how much i'm hanging out with my friends who i'm hanging out with um for the next bit but know that also need to um do this for myself and start defining self-care as putting myself first academically and and in every other endeavor and not just physically which is also not going very well because can't really take care of myself physically because i'm breaking out overweight whatever it is what it is but yeah so new outlook on life for tomorrow 
62,um pretty good day today felt really good after working out the day felt longer felt like had more time um don't love how late i'm going to bed right now because will be waking up early in the morning um saw less friends today almost none really um but got some work done um not as far ahead as uh that i'd like to be but definitely got some work done and am hoping that this process you know gets better and feels more comfortable and things um but so far i'm really liking it and connecting to people to get involved in my extracurricular [inaudible] and had like pretty good conversation with my male friend um and it was just like that was like my guess my study break if you wanna call it that um and think it went little over time but did like it and liked reading with him so it ended up being okay but other than that it was pretty normal day didn't really see much of my friends and wonder if this is gonna be the new norm hmm yeah don't know if that good thing or bad thing right now so that something i'm struggling with but other than that not much 
63,um today was pretty interesting didn't really hang out with any of my friends today um did see my dad and after class um went with him guess he was just checking in on me making sure things were going okay that i'm getting involved in things and it was nice it wasn't bad at all um yeah feel like i'm really getting things done which is really good feeling um and think it coming little bit at the cost of hanging out with my friends and don't i'm not upset about it or sad about it yet think um but i'm hoping that can find that balance but as of right now really just need to settle down and focus so i'm not really spending my time thinking about what could be doing without my friends because know what want and need to be doing um so mean think that like more of good thing than bad thing but um other things mean so talked to some of my friend today who really close with me who met here and was just like hope you're alive hope you're okay whatever miss you um and think she being alone lot more now and think that bothering her and she somebody who not really great by herself um and think earlier was willing to help her by being with her but at the cost of me doing well which is troublesome but miss her and love hanging out with her so think have to find that balance as well but yeah it just like really interesting feeling where i'm like i'm alone but i'm also meeting new people and like sat with somebody who haven't spoken with in while because she didn't really get along with friend group that had been hanging out with and it was just like it was cool it was relaxed him and another person as well yeah think i'm broadening my friend groups and i'm not leaving the other ones behind i'm just spreading out guess so this is new and right now as of right now i'm not hating it so think that good 
64,um today felt okay again i'm spending more time by myself don't really know how feel about it so i'm just like really really tired and being dedicated to the gym i'm still not getting as much sleep as had hoped um but yeah am like i've seen couple of my friends today and like very quickly see most members but like don't know it just doesn't feel the same and don't want things to fall apart 'cause really really love having them around love being their friend and love how feel when i'm around them but i'm afraid that things are going to fall apart just 'cause we're not spending that much time together anymore and it really it sad am sad about it um because miss them lot but it not like they don't live like mean they they all live like 30 seconds from me but it just don't know i'm afraid that things will change and i'm sad without them i'm probably little bit more productive without them but didn't think that would have to fall off entirely but think like what i'm going through think everybody else is as well where like they're also not spending that much time with other people so it just like don't know it just me getting around that and i'm just little bit saddened by it but other than that really spend most of my time by myself doing homework no yeah that about it and eating i'm really trying to pay attention to how eat um yeah definitely feel like maybe have been overeating in the past couple weeks so i'm trying to do like portion control figure out what i'm going to eat before get into the dining hall because i'm really trying to lose weight now because i've gained the freshman 15 so need to lose that asap also my skin is terrible um feel better now that i'm working out and like feel less stressed but i'm tired and don't see my skin improving don't even know if i'm healthy or not haven't had my period in over month and half so yeah just don't know what going on at all with my body and usually when there something wrong with me and like through my body that usually tells me that there something that i'm trying to cope with mentally but usually don't like push feelings away so much don't really feel things but they come about through my body which means that i'll have to figure out what is bothering me um which is going to be really really hard so yeah 
65,um today was an interesting day saw some of my friends earlier this morning some new friends some um normal ones guess my normal group um but yeah i'm just doing work today felt pretty good with econ like sat down and did it and found that really could do some um which was really really great thing to see um like could do the work by myself basically and that made me feel good um going to the gym keep looking at the scale waiting for me to lose weight kind of hard um so i'm struggling little bit i'm yeah basically just really missed my friends spoke to one of them today and was just like i'm just like scared you know i'm like scared that we're not gonna be friends and that like things are gonna fall apart was like really love the people that i've built relationships with and like she like reassured me that that wouldn't happen but mean how much can we really say isn't gonna happen so and think that was something that was bothering me unconsciously but yeah i'm just trying to like get around this this hump getting involved in things there just so much to do all the time i'm sore i'm tired i'm waking up have to go to bed early wake up early but like like it like the length of the days like the way wake up you know there more structure and appreciate it but yeah that just my days um social things really not much has happened spending lot more time by myself now 
66,pretty good day today um got some work done for econ started my math [pisa] um but also spent some time with my dad spent some time with my friend and spoke to her about my dilemma that was having with just like not just not seeing her but like while we were walking back and she was like going back to her dorm i'm not really sure where we were going um she was like okay are you gonna head home now or and was like well she said where are we going and was like i'm going to [can today] she was like okay i'll see you later and was like you're not coming with she was like didn't know if you wanted me to and like that made me really frustrated and it was the first time think felt like mad and it wasn't wasn't mad at her was just mad at like the situation and you know it was just like the culmination of like this is exactly what like not only what was afraid of but what think thought [wasn't] gonna happen with her and also her relationship with her boyfriend and like she has no idea how much people want to be around her and i'm such an hypocrite but like it just it really really bothered me and like at first just like started like running up and down stairs and just like being like no it fine i'm fine like just needed like walked away from her multiple times and then eventually she like grabbed hold of me and was like just need you to tell me and was just like don't understand why you're pushing people away or like it wasn't that it was that like know she not trying to push people away but like how does she have no idea how great she is and how much people wanna be around her and ended up crying for her and was just like saddened by it because she has no idea and she so dependent on her boyfriend view of her that she has no idea what happening and she also [chaining] herself for this guy who doesn't even text to say how are you doing and so that was something that really like shook me today that was like my fresh air of emotion and then also hung out with some other friends for little bit in different social group and basically told them my life story of like my parents and like family structure family struggles of course and it was just like it was fine but usually when talk about those things i'm like really okay and it like doesn't bother me but like today could not shake it off after spoke about it and that something that doesn't usually happen so like was just don't know what and so like after hanging out with them after told them just couldn't be happy couldn't dance around or with them and then it just like felt like don't know and this guy is like still somebody that wanna be with and have relationship with but like it made me wonder if i'm enough if i'm like even confident enough to be with him and will ever be comfortable enough to be with him 'cause i'm so different like we don't don't just like dance you know what mean don't don't do those things and that his norm so yeah those are my social struggles today but it getting better feel good i've made amends so it all right 
67,pretty interesting day today um didn't get as mu actually no ended up getting the work done that wanted to um studied little bit made me feel little bit more inconfident though um went to play with um male friend the same one as usual and uh it was really interesting it was about like these kids who are in very conservative religious school and setting um and their parents didn't really tell them about sex or anything so when they came about it um it was just like it was very interesting it was really basically about how like not telling the truth hurts you in the end but um there was some um don't know the it had little bit to do with like domestic violence and like sexual abuse and i'm like usually fine with that from my past but like this time guess like and didn't even notice um but he told me after he said that like while that scene was happening like was shaking my leg he can tell that like was kinda like breathing faster or whatever and like i've just never noticed that so that was very interesting but like also he noticed that but he didn't do anything about it he said like he thought he was gonna put his hand on my leg but then he was like but know you're not on that wave essentially meaning that i'm not interested in him which is completely false and he knows that but um yeah also saw another male friend today that think should be more interested in than am i'm just really struggling with balancing social life and like feel like it all coming at me but also have lot to do and like don't know how to have time for these things yet like really want relationship for some unknown reason um but yeah things are like changing really just wanna get do really well in this econ exam that what i'm hoping to do uh yeah must just just must but yeah that about it pretty interesting day today was very relaxed but still got stuff done which was good

70,um today was super busy day um just really had lot to do thing after thing after thing did lot of work got my work done um which is good don't really feel prepared for econ tomorrow so have to wake up early and study for that for sure um and don't think i'll ever feel like incredibly prepared but um it i've gotta do that it gonna happen but yeah i'm kinda nervous about it but at the same time like feel like there are things that know you know and when went and did um like office hours with my tf like was able to say some things which is very rare so like there is definitely improvement um but i'm so really nervous about it and really wanna do well and met with the personal trainer today so i'm gonna be doing that [i assume] once week our goal is to lose 15 pounds and don't know yeah just getting [fit] guess prepare for lacrosse maybe um other things yeah i'm just like really tired my body hurts uh and really really want to do well on this econ exam so i'm really gonna try my best but yeah that really all i'm really thinking about um yesterday somebody called me square which essentially is somebody that not very interesting and is boring and today when saw that same person and was like happy energetic my usual self they called me polygon which guess was compliment but like i'm not boring person but if seem boring is 'cause you don't know me so that something that definitely stuck with me today um but yeah also had really good interaction with those people today and like just like different people than normal but yeah i'm just kinda doing my own thing currently don't know how feel about it but it happening so yeah 
71,um pretty not stressful day today but interesting day today spent most of my day studying for my econ exam which was also today um and had studied for it earlier but just wanted to get more in 'cause really really wanted to do well um paid off bit there were definitely some things knew definitely some things didn't know um but that okay like figured out my mistakes along the way and just tried to keep going and did as much as could lot of people struggled with it which think was okay um but yeah so now i'm just currently being sexiled from my room but really wanna go to bed 'cause have to wake up and go to the gym tomorrow 'cause didn't go this morning 'cause really wanted to study and went to bed late as well um tomorrow no excuses but um yeah i'm just like really tired um hang out little bit today with my big sibling in the association of black women of harvard um with two of my other friends and kinda felt like my big sib was lot closer with the friend that consider myself very close to and like it was fine and everything but don't know it just didn't give me great feeling felt like was kind of useless um and pointless which was yeah like said was saddening but not really things can do about it um other than that yeah mean really just spent lot of my day studying today didn't get to see my male friend that usually see every day um and yeah so that was unfortunate as well but i'm also yesterday somebody approached me and gave me their number so that was new and think they're really attractive and they're pretty nice person during my math class so he pretty cool guy um yeah yeah that basically what going on in my life trying not to pick at my face but that currently what happening um which is bad 'cause my skin was doing great and shall continue to do so if stop touching it but it addictive but other than that things have been like really like slow today [i didn't love it] don't feel very good about my body today either so something else [inaudible] want to eat 'cause knew hadn't worked out which is kind of even more [inaudible] think but yeah 
72,pretty busy day today barely did any work um quite problematic have thing due sunday i'm really struggling with it it more creative than anything else so have to write um poem by spoken word and i'm struggling with the poem hard thing about that you can't really rush art so i'm kind of in jiffy currently [inaudible] stress about it too much i'm just really tired struggling with male friends um the one guy that i've been like hanging out with lot kind of like him or whatever don't know guess he just like an entire paradox and he reminds me way too much of my father for me to like him yet do and don't want to fall into the same position that my mother fell in so this is me trying to um just stop that by not like falling off or like cutting him off of my list but just keeping it platonic [inaudible] platonic just need to keep him as friend and just friend and cut off that interest 'cause today when found out that he could possibly be talking to another girl just got really upset and like not even upset guess was sad and like didn't know why and then realized why was sad and it wasn't because he was with another girl it was more that he was lying to me this whole time and saying that he wasn't ready for relationship yet or yada yada but here am hearing from other people that he pursuing this girl or this girl pursuing him and he letting her do that so just like this is the first time something like this has ever happened to me and it makes me feel little bit like i'm not enough but know that completely false so like what am worried about um but do really wish had significant other like seriously it just really i'm forced to be lonely all the time which is crazy to think about because i've never had relationship so why am missing something that i've never had but who knows what going on with my life right now 
73,um today was eventful um sort of just like continuation of last night um and we had conversation me and this guy was really hopeful but just feel really bad feel like did something wrong that things are gonna be different now but um at the same time like i'm also sort of seeing some similarities between this and me and my and my mom and my dad and that scares the heck out of me um but [inaudible] that like just hung out with some friends that are not quite in my friend group but really enjoyed it think like them but one of the girls has been ostracized from my friend group due to some of her previous actions in the beginning of the year um but think did [inaudible] and think it was good opportunity to do so currently i'm just super tired and i'm feeling like some men are just not great for me but i'm also sort of in this loop where like there somebody who wants me and whatever but is not ready to be in relationship then there somebody who think is attractive don't know if they like me but like hasn't done anything but whatever i'm struggling basically [inaudible] like wanna make out with somebody wanna love somebody want somebody to love me and to want me i'm just feeling little unloved right now and that hard 
74,um today was okay and got some work done on this essay that i'm really struggling with got an extension on it um am yeah just came back from hanging out with some friends different friend group went to dinner for my friend birthday today um one of my other friends is really struggling with her relationship so that was kind of hard to see but feel like just have lot work to do and i'm trying to be productive that is quite hard on the weekends and [inaudible] even and i'm super tired but i've like lot of work to do tomorrow so will be up late doing so much work um let see other than that things have been okay i've been like talking to some other guys um but the guy that have like known and i'm actually friends with realize still have some tendencies occasionally for so that rough but yeah just don't know what to do what gonna happen with anything so i'm just sort of taking things the way they go not [inaudible] anything too much 'cause it just hurts me in the end so figured not to give anything too much weight but i'm also this is weird to say and really don't enjoy saying it out loud 'cause it just it weird but i'm like quite horny which is don't know it not bad but like guess i'm just really craving don't know kissing or something but i've never done that which is weird so yeah i'm just like in very weird position right now 
75,really tired haven't stayed up this late in long time have lot of work um don't like saving my work to the last minute and that definitely what today was result of so definitely won't do that i'm gonna try to get ahead with my work so don't have that much to do this weekend um hopefully can actually follow through with that plan um but yeah other than that i'm just really trying to focus on work went to my professor house today and it was absolutely amazing um not only was his home beautiful and his like family was just amazing and warm and welcoming and everything was you know set um it reminded me little bit of home in terms of not necessarily like rhode island but what that image of success looks like again and like why tried so hard to get here and what i'm hoping for and like how happy and safe wanna feel and so that just sort of like revived things for me which was amazing and also like hung out with different people got little bit closer with the other kids and that was awesome so like yeah today was like really interesting experience had lot of work but my time was well-spent think was pretty productive today didn't do lot of work with friends other than math which is like study group and like the math questions on there were like you're kind of doing things on your own other people are just kind of there and they're like tas answering questions so yeah today was pretty good day 
76,super super exhausted um finished most of my work that due tomorrow just have really short reading have to do but i'm so exhausted have to go to bed [inaudible] wake up tomorrow to run have really busy day tomorrow um and it terms of today uh went to this meeting [inaudible] politics um with the secretary of health um donna shalala and that was really awesome um just to hear her experience coincidentally one of my guy friends also ended up being chosen from the lottery to go so it was just really interesting um haven't seen my other friend group in while and my roommate made really good point today after expressed um some worries about the friend group as in things just felt different and felt sort of out of the loop because hadn't you know been with them as much as maybe they had been with each other or something um she said you don't have friend groups you have individual friends and they can get together and you can all be friends but you don't have friend groups and that was awesome she just so incredible and she always has good insights and that made me feel lot better and um made me reevaluate you know how perceive friends and friend groups and how don't need to be like groupie guess don't even know what groupie is but that how i'm gonna use the word um yeah other than that i'm genuinely exhausted and i'm also feeling like and i'm just evaluating my friend groups and like with my guy friend who saw at the meeting um it was just like really inspiring you know and he like he driven guess and was really driven and feel like lost little bit of that so i'm trying to get it back my other friends don't quite see that as much um and he also really wants to be president and wanna be in government so like that like similarity that we have obviously i'm not necessarily in the same page but either way um but there also some tension there as in like he'll say things like oh [will she] be like don't know the secretary of education or the first lady and things like that which is like interesting don't know just don't know what to think so i'm interested in this other guy now and now it feels like that i'm ready to move on he ready to get started with me and don't like that so yeah 
77,today was okay pretty structured was very busy had lot of things to do um didn't get lot of work done as had hoped to um but still making progress trying to prepare for the game this weekend think it gonna be really hard to do work so i'm just trying to prepare for that is it going well not quite um also saw made deeper connection with uh one of my friends who kinda felt like was worried about um as close as yesterday so mean that was good we sort of just like straightened things out um and yeah so got some closure got closer in other relationships and things um but yeah most things really was just really busy with school met some really awesome person um who is running for governor in colorado and was really inspired by them so emailed them see if can help them over the summer with their campaign and such and that was really exciting it such great experience like was just so happy that was taking the class but also that like they were so open to uh help and just just hearing the details and they shared details of like where to go from where you are now is really something that made me feel really excited 
78,super busy day today um really just class class meeting meeting um mainly it kind of catching up where like don't have time for some homework sometimes which is really not great really don't love going to bed this late um yeah i'm really just not feeling it at all so hopefully that'll change also my face is breaking out don't know if it stress or what but that that annoying as well um so hopefully that'll fix itself just have lot to do have midterm tomorrow feel semi-prepared for but really don't know i'm just like nervous guess but yeah hopefully things go well and in terms of social things didn't see lot of my friends today saw one of my friends at um dinner just by coincidence [inaudible] so could go get tutoring um got my econ back as an actual grade like in the raw score it not very good but in the scale am like pretty average like got minus with the scale which think is huge improvement for me definitely still wanna do better but it did give me little bit of confidence saying that like okay you can improve like yeah the course itself sucks and the way they manage it sucks but like you can get better so yeah 
79,um pretty all right day today was really busy with just work and classes didn't have lot of time to do homework which is pattern that i'm starting to see um which is little bit problematic so need to fix that um my friend was leaving today to go home and we just talked about how it'd be kind of weird and then thought about thanksgiving and uh how it would be weird for me as well but haven't really given much thought to it um yes i'm gonna miss hit lot but um it really important that he does this it big deal and yeah he kinda just was like you mean lot to me and like really um rock with you on deeper level than even thought did and that was sort of news for me and makes me rethink what wanna do with other guys and stuff um but yeah just really wanna get work done harvard [inaudible] is this weekend so i'm trying to get ahead and work and as result did not work today which was really unfortunate but hopefully i'll be able to get some work done tomorrow um and yeah went out to dinner today with my friends 'cause it was my friend birthday um upcoming events that have in mind really is just like tests like and like big projects really wanna do really well and realize that it little late but really want to um so i'm going to work on that which means i'm starting early with everything but yeah 
80,um pretty interesting day today didn't get any work done um went to bed really late last night so had hard time waking up this morning didn't wake up early didn't go to the gym um again did not do any homework was not as productive as i'd hoped to be but then again also didn't have much time had to pack um pick up some things um definitely feeling stressed about social situations more so than academic situations um really struggling with like love life um friends little bit there was like little bit of tension about getting on certain buses to get to harvardyale which is this weekend something else was little bit worried about was um like being parent this weekend and just like looking out for my friends and making sure that they're not like too drunk or whatever but think that was mostly in my head um and think they're gonna be fine but like even if things do happen i'm okay with being that person one because care about them and two like what else am gonna be doing so yeah i'm just taking it day by day um i'm definitely every day wishing more that was in relationship but that that like low-key stressed about school as in like really wanna get my grades up and it like not even like what it used to be where it like need to get my grades up or whatever it like want to genuinely want to do well 'cause like like the classes and wish that my work reflected that um but yeah 
81,pretty interesting day today um we went to the harvard-yale game today which was in um [redacted] so yesterday went on the bus there today um woke up we went to get breakfast after waiting little too long for some of my friends to get ready then we went to the complex uh which was where the game was went to the tailgates went to the game for little bit then went back to the tailgates um and really it was just like lot of dancing dancing with people um lots of alcohol everywhere didn't drink don't feel pressured to drink either which was really great and also didn't have to be parent to any of my friends which would not have minded but um it was cool that that didn't happen and then let see um yeah also hung out with [girlfriend] one-on-one today we just got some food and watched some netflix that was about it new friend different friend group it felt comfortable you know it felt kinda normal which is good um one of my friends today this this was the last day that would see her um until after thanksgiving break and was really sad about it um and like met her here so she friend that made here during the peer rotation program and we've gotten really close um and cried cried twice actually and it only gonna be like 10 or so days or something but like don't know was just like really really saddened by that and it makes me really worried for like uh winter break even spring break you know it just like you get so close to these people 'cause you're always with them always surrounded by them so like days apart from them really feels like months 'cause time goes so quickly yet so slowly here um other than that yeah kinda just like wanted to hang out with guy not hang out with guys but like do things with guys this weekend and didn't and that okay think i'm okay with that decision i'm not sure why really wanted to in the first place um so that was an internal strife had but yeah got over it um not any drama today well actually um today some girls were looking for the bus to get back home so they were calling texting had me share my location with them and things so finally when me who had been there for an hour waiting the bus wa for the bus was ready to get on they weren't responding to me so called to make sure that they got on the bus and they were already on it they were like oh yeah we're already on the bus um and then said okay is there room for three more 'cause thought we were all planning on sitting together and they were like no really don't think so which you know that was weird within itself just not great experience 'cause like we spent lot of time helping them standing in the rain waiting for them for them to already be there and not say anything and then on top of that once actually get on the bus guess who there both of them just like really an interesting experience and like spoke to my friend about it who was also there it was like we [inaudible] fre fake friends from an incident that happened with them way in the beginning of the year that [inaudible] guy drama but essentially has to do with trust and communication once again so that was something to think 
82,um pretty relaxed day today spent most of my time by myself woke up kind of early at first for fire alarm then went back to bed after that and feel like got pretty good night rest despite that interruption um but yeah mean really spent most my time by myself and just did homework got little bit ahead which is good but also i'm kinda not stressed 'cause like thanksgiving and it doesn't really feel real but know that like don't know like i'm doing my work but don't need to be that far ahead um on top of that also made plans with somebody for tomorrow night which is new thing for me 'cause usually [inaudible] like school night to school night but already have that much homework anyways so it'll be okay um yeah so other than that like genuinely did not do much today like at all and was actually okay with that you know was just like really relaxed just doing my thing and yeah also spoke to my friend lot um over the phone he talking listening to his dad tell stories and stuff really nervous feel like i'm dealing with two guys right now and one doesn't want to be in relationship yet but is still calling me things like wifey and whatever and then another one is interested and i'm interested as well and he somebody that doesn't remind me of my father who was like somewhat abusive and things so think it something that should go for because don't wanna be in the same position that my mom was in so that something that like [redacted] stressing in the back of my mind but don't really know but um yeah so i'm trying to pursue the second one we'll see what happens well yeah and then that-that been my pretty chillax day 
83,so on walk home now just watched two movies with this guy and just kinda snuggled or whatever which was fine feeling okay except that i'm walking home by myself and know that the other guy that know is unhealthy for me um would have never let me walk home by myself but it is what it is and it was just too much stimulation guess so yeah i'm walking home i'm feeling don't know how i'm feeling but i'm okay um yeah i'm just other than that today has been really relaxed day um got my homework done for tomorrow like so early which was awesome and think it because had knew that won't be able to do work tonight so guess that good for my work ethic you know knowing that like when need to get stuff done get it done so yeah 
84,pretty okay day today pretty normal um i'm home um because it thanksgiving break so i'm just reading currently but today was pretty relaxed day went to class and didn't really see anybody today met some people at lunch ended up hanging out with them but that was pure coincidence um yeah it was just me today really packing and getting ready and struggling bit with one of my guy friends and understanding what he wants from me if he wants me to wait for him in terms of having relationship or just do whatever and so he saying not to wait for me and that you know when he ready he'll he'll come for me so that makes things easier with my other friend um yeah so that was really the only stress went through today didn't do lot of homework um but i'm planning on being productive tomorrow we will see how that goes so yeah 
85,um i'd say it wasn't bad went to breakfast with my dad woke up kind of late went to bed late as well though um let see saw some friends saw lot of friends actually was so happy to see them um just reminded me of who used to be who was and who still am guess and the people that have helped me become who am and just like the amazingness that i've come from and felt strong again feel like can go back into the world and remember who [redacted] was who she stands for and such um yeah it was just like such great experience like i'm so happy saw them and like yes we've gotten older but have we changed absolutely not and really appreciate that about my friends and think they're so real for it so just feel very grateful um also saw some family unfortunately all they ask is how [redacted] better get all as how [redacted] so that was that but things happen 
86,um pretty short-ish day today would say um woke up little bit late tried to do some homework facetimed friends and family spoke to friends on the phone so really only got one piece of work done today so wasn't super productive spent time with my family um which is good little bit of fear of missing out north carolina with the rest of my family but i'm also glad i'm here and can just go home whenever um yeah talking to my friend-ish i'm not sure what to call him yet but i've been liking [inaudible] stuff and he expressed that he like misses me he calls me beautiful or whatever and like which is nice he just great person but feel like don't know him so i'm struggling with that bit but yeah and i'm just really ready to go to bed after going black friday shopping and being utterly unsuccessful 
87,um pretty relaxed day today went shopping with my mom spent some quality time with her which was good watched movies it was very relaxed ate pretty normal amount um yeah today was just like lot of doing the same thing so like we were just shopping like walking around the mall expressing disappointment as black friday often causes um yeah really like nothing today spoke to my friend um over text lot and like him he likes me we're aware of that um don't really know we're not like in relationship or anything or dating or anything but definitely building towards something which is new for me but i'm feeling this feeling that haven't felt before with guy where just like don't know he just really cute and like he makes my heart smile little bit and um that new um but other than that yeah actually been dodging calls today from the other guy who i'm just friends with but um still just like too much calling don't wanna talk on the phone all the time but yeah 
88,um pretty okay day today went to the stores with my mom spent some quality time with her um spoke lot to um one of my friends um got to see my friends that haven't seen in really long time um once got back to campus which was super exciting and really didn't feel lot of stress today got some work done keep forgetting that it saturday um which guess unintentionally i've been using as an excuse to not work as hard and be okay with not doing as much which is problematic but that okay it not okay actually um but yeah definitely did get some work done today and and hoping to get more done tomorrow but yeah everything seems all right 
89,um pretty interesting day today friend slept over went to the gym then uh we'll tried to go to the gym multiple times then just went for an actual run and then went to brunch then did homework went to uh dinner and did more homework went to math question center facetimed friend who interested in me um have no idea if i'm interested in him also don't know how to do these things and i'm feeling really stressed about that situation like extremely stressed out to the point where like don't know what i'm feeling and i'm like well not angry but i'm just like frustrated because don't know what to do and just like yeah and i'm just like yeah just wish knew what to do guess but other than that nothing incredibly crazy has really happened today i've genuinely just been stressed about the situation um but now that it happened i'm like don't know how feel about him don't even know if i'm interested in him don't see what he sees in me just really nerve-racking but it is what it is apparently 
90,um pretty stressful day today went to the gym i'm getting bigger which is not good um also had lot of social um discussions or like stress guess um had good conversation with one of my friends who haven't really connected with in the level that we have before in quite some time and you know we both related on the struggles that we have with our family and our family structure and mental and physical abuse and and parents and fathers and things and um had been noticing something in this one guy that have been hanging out with where he did lot of things that are very similar to the things that my father did and i've tried to push it away and tried to ignore the signs but it was there and when she had told me that she'd recognized some of those same traits um it kind of hit me hard and my other friend have been saying like oh you know don't don't just ignore those signs yada yada yada but they don't have that experience so like understood it and like knew they were looking out for me but also knew that they were on my side and they didn't really like him whereas this girl pretty good friends with this guy um and like pretty good friends with me but she also relates to me on that level of understanding what it like to have parents like that so um that was just really eye-opening to me and really stressful and just like made lot of tension at dinner like moving uh just moving around and like being pulled aside and asked to talk and just having hostile hostile situation where just didn't enjoy it but after that kind of just isolated myself went to meeting where felt so inspired and so great and so ready to work and like just grind and really do well and and it it was meeting with the whole bunch of kids from the undergraduate council um and they're just doing awesome things and that we're working on getting multicultural center here and they were like you should run for uc and was like you know what what is stopping me other than fear so just felt reinspired and made me feel lot more determined to do my work and get it all done so now i'm heading to bed and feel accomplished because pretty much crossed off everything on my list 
91,pretty interesting day today um super busy which really loved was doing stuff was productive to degree socialized enough had great dinner with my teacher some new friends which is really exciting it was awesome um also had weird interaction with one guy friend the newer one um and we're at the mqc and he finished his thing at 830 and it was the time was approaching 1015 and was like oh when did you finish your pset and he said 830 and said what are you still doing here and he took that as like why are you here in like negative way and didn't mean that but that how he took it and he kind of well he didn't storm off immediately but he like slowly like packed up and whatever and didn't really say that he was upset about it but could tell um so that was weird and then texted him later about it and he was just like no just really missed you and like knew took it the wrong way but that was just straight in the moment yada yada yada and was like okay i'm just really struggling with the idea of missing people that you don't know and don't know how this kid likes me when he doesn't know me and misses me when we barely had any like normal interactions so that something i'm like really struggling with um also the older the other guy um that like been here for quite some time and has been causing lot of my struggle um today asked if he could take me to play and then some dinner and he wants to take me out and that his dad said to him today um don't let [inaudible] be the one that got away whatever and was just getting over this hump of can't be with you right now i'm not ready you remind me too much of my dad yada yada so that little bit stressful but i'm also feeling great 'cause i'm just like was productive today it was just such balanced day and really loved it um yeah didn't really see lot of my like normal close friends though which just realized now but um yeah also have like lot of work to do but think should go to bed um then also have to gym and i'm overweight which the scale retold me today so that was exciting um but yeah so now need to figure out how to actually eat well 
92,today was an okay day um reconnected with friend that made kind of in the beginning of the year um she is really nice really like her um very much like the friends that had back home and here lot of my friends identify as the same race or identity um as do and she does not so that was nice and just sort of like it didn't matter didn't make difference obviously um but it made me feel like was branching out more so in the way that i'd like to um today also hit my head really hard um feeling concussioned-ish but we'll see what happens made doctor appointment um uh let see didn't really see lot of my other friends today um but just did work going to bed early because don't feel good because of my head which is unfortunate um have lot of papers to work on and feel like i've been like work on it little bit but don't know what that means and so i'm really struggling with actually working on it um also need to go to the gym i'm fat and there lot of fat on my stomach and don't like it i'm not used to that also late on my period since i'm kinda moody but also usually get frustrated really easily might have concussions have i've had four um and one of my friends has expressed interest in me and now wants to approach being in relationship um wanted me to come see him tonight and told him to come see me and at first he was like what and then he was like sure and he said he'd come um texted him three times and he hasn't responded which is abnormal from him um and he has test tomorrow so like i'm not mad but did get frustrated really easily and was just like what in the world is going on need to be held to the same standards that he held to so like when you come at me for not responding or not seeing you for day or something like this is two-way street you know hold some responsibility you have agency in this situation as well so like that don't know then with the other guy haven't spoken to him at all today don't really know what to do that experience had with him recently of him getting kind of frustrated because said why are you here not in that sense as in like and not sure if said this yesterday but was um at the mqc the math question center um got there kind of late around 900-ish and this guy was there um and it was around 1015 and was like hey like when did you finish the [psat] because he was finishing an essay and then he finished that he started playing on rubik cube he was like oh finished at 830 mind you mqc starts at 830 so was like what are you still doing here like you finished long ago and he took that as why are you here and um was like well can leave if you want and was like that not what meant at all um but like he didn't storm off or anything but he like went to the bathroom and obviously there was mood change he very like bubbly sort of light-hearted person and the person that interacted with after that was not that person um so just texted him about it and he was like oh i'm sorry just really miss you knew you didn't mean it that way as soon as walked out but just really miss you i'm not used to not seeing you this often and i'm just like confused as to like how do you miss somebody that you don't know how do you like somebody you don't know um so that been on my mind and feel like should confront that issue 
93,today was pretty great for most of the time um it was super busy jam-packed in the schedule first class well had meeting at 11 o'clock but her meeting before was going over so had to reschedule my first class at 1130 until 230 then from 300 to 400 had office hours 400 to 500 had class 500 to 800 had women center preparation for the event and then the event um 800 to 900 had an event for my path then 900 to 1030 had math question center and then that wasn't enough time for me so well no no actually 900 to 930 went to my um mandatory um study break for my entryway left early 'cause really had to do homework and then from 930 to 1030 was at the math question center until it closed then up until about like 10 15 minutes ago just left the library to finish the math homework um and my econ homework still have to do more econ tomorrow um didn't really see lot of my friends saw one in passing made some new friends saw some pretty good people and yeah saw another friend that was really good to see um little bit of tension with the weird situation or opportunity which is in general was talking about my computer screen background which was van gogh um and he was like you wanna see my background he was being playful and it was like picture of clearly him drawn and it was just funny this was like van gogh and then like picture that like ten-year-old could have drawn or something and he was like my girlfriend drew it or whatever and so some guys were laughing and they're like it probably the worst i've ever seen and don't know how he took it and don't know if he got mad or he just was like focused in his work um but that was sort of like weird situation he said he was fine but don't think he really was um but yeah and currently my friend this guy who i've been like he been pretty important part of my life for some time now for well my harvard time the guy that always influences my day somehow um he has been really weird lately and like hasn't been responding to me hasn't been trying to see me anymore or anything which is weird 'cause i'm not sure what did wrong or what did to change that and i'm just questioning everything now and this is directly after you said that he kinda wants to move forward with me so i'm just utterly confused but feel like i'm knowing great things here i'm feeling better about myself at harvard and i'm really okay with that 
94,uh pretty long day today class class meeting nap first successful nap it was amazing meeting um socializing with friends dinner wanted to do bit of work today definitely didn't get to do that was definitely feeling some symptoms of concussion i'm starting to feel it now should be taking things easy but of course didn't do that 'cause was struggling [essentially] with somebody kind of got [inaudible] but yeah now i'm just gonna go straight to bed this is too much 
96,um today was interesting started off okay got worse and worse as the day went on and i've been getting really frustrated really quickly um and suddenly and i'm not quite sure how to handle it um and feeling like i've had to cry for really long time can't really get there got mad at my friend in like split second today and then it was fine don't even know why got mad at her um then like bumped into them like literally minutes later and was like sorry like i'll see you guys later and she didn't say anything but the my other friend did and then it just reminded me of conversation had with someone that went on date with yesterday and just like how quickly people switch and how much hate that and how find that so scary and wonder if scared her and if things would be the same don't know um but yeah so that happened i'm stressing over writing this paper and just can't cannot get it do uh on the paper don't know what to say don't know how to write these types of papers um on top of that just feel really stressed don't feel good like i'm sick now can't focus um it hurts to look at screens for too long need to sleep my dad is gonna disown me in like couple of days already know it he already starting this whole process and it just coming at really bad time um and i'm struggling with like letting those experiences affect everything else that do um and like other people that interact with because know that my dad is not normal but shouldn't expect other people to be like that as well and just feel bad for treating people differently because maybe felt like saw similar trait or something um yeah just i'm sad i'm so sad i'm just like really sad and can't even cry about it yeah 
97,pretty stressful day today um lot of social tension within friend groups we added someone to our friend group that immediately backfired um in terms of information shared not staying within four walls uh so have some tension with the person that went on date on um hopefully not with this new girl who in our group because really like her like we met at [inaudible] and she just awesome you know um but yeah have been thinking lot about my dad today dealing with rejection overthinking social interactions i'm just really struggling and i'm overthinking everything so i'm just going to not say anything from now on when it comes to me and this guy and i'm just not going to think about anything at all not thing i'm just going to be the same person was which is the person he liked and we'll take it from there um schoolwork got some work done on my paper today um but realize that working on the same thing all day is not it not conducive so will be splitting up my time tomorrow with math and econ and little bit of my paper um yeah but now i'm just trying to get some shut-eye 
98,long day today reconnected with an old friend not old friend friend haven't seen in while he gave me so much insight basically i'm making the wrong decision in pursuing relationship with this guy and need to stop and need to listen to everyone because they're right and just don't wanna believe um myself right now so that happening wasn't as productive as i'd wanted to be today will not be seeing anyone tomorrow except for breakfast and um yeah basically friends aren't really my friends just one person actually um and yeah this person is not right for me and need to make sure that stick by this conclusion other important things um no not really that was basically the bulk of my day the reason got stressed today is because of him sad because of him somewhat happy because of him basically think just want relationship when i'm willing to do it with anybody which is so problematic but also know that not true i'm not willing to do it with anybody because push away people that aren't him and it just so problematic and basically just need to reevaluate my life and understand that like wanna be like pleased and like think just just like more body or i'm horny or something but don't know what to do so yeah 
99,pretty interesting day um had got some like great work done was pretty productive did lot of econ finished my paper which was great um currently yeah finished my paper went to library went to econ office hours and then um brought my friend [redacted] went to cvs visited another friend um that friend one went on date on was thoroughly disgusted by him [inaudible] and he called me coward um so that don't practice the words that say and was wondering when was gonna be done with the space of you know me monitoring myself around him i'll say my thoughts being quiet and whatnot um honestly just felt really disrespected and not because of what he said of what he called me it just that he really value his friendship and and as always cast out my definition of friendship my definition of friendship is all or nothing whatever whatever and it was fine but um my definition is uplifting and he wouldn't just call me coward if he were friend until you're being kind and here how you do it or know you can do this here what you need to do that not what he did and he came at me he doesn't let me finish he makes me feel powerless he makes me feel terrible about myself makes me feel stupid i'm in for some reason i'm still trying to like this man so this saturday would be my last date with him yeah [tertiary] 'cause this is i'm better than this i'm stronger than this and i'm not being my best self and think break is going to reveal lot of things so yeah 
100,um interesting day today was more confrontational that have been in while um but think it turned out well um got most of what wanted to say out got some closure realized some things um about my relationship with this guy um very negative not healthy relationship and i'm okay i'm okay with canceling that relationship maybe not entirely but definitely keeping it as something that remains friends because deserve to be loved and i'm smart and care about people and care about myself to continue with that today after talking to this guy after yesterday night he called me coward and so found all of the things he hates about me um we had conversation and he said something along the lines of perhaps he subconsciously trying to not like me because he holds me to different standards and he holds black women to different standards than he does of white women and he doesn't quite know what it is to be black yet and i'm not sure where hatred ties into that argument or where purposeful disgust of someone is necessary however am okay and am strong black woman and am proud of my blackness not that it uniform but that it unique and appreciate mine as much as appreciate everyone else and um think i've just grown tonight and i'm really glad that have really good friends like my friend um that reconnected with not reconnected but like just who haven't seen in while and um he was just so helpful gave me some mental support gave me advice told me to text him after with the number 501 or for any help or if i'm okay and that just like that something you want not even in relationship it doesn't have to be like that just from friend like uh this person really cares and like knows what to do you know and that just just like really really appreciated that and one of my friends left today um for good for all of winter break it doesn't quite feel real yet but she just gonna be gone for whole month and half that just crazy you know 'cause we've gotten so close to these people and i'm hoping that this break for me is time of rebirth and renewal um but i'm just really wanna do well in my exams so i'm gonna focus on that focus on myself the goodness of what deserve which is nothing less than the best 
101,um pretty good day today was able to finish my paper hand in two papers which means now just have to study for my two exams not feeling super prepared for them but did some good work around them um in terms of social interactions got to hang out with lot of my friends that really like spent minimum time with people that made friends with that don't necessarily enjoy spending time with um and avoided some confrontation today but now i'm feeling okay i'm just going to bed now i'm really tired and think just need to reclaim myself and in doing that need to cut off some relationships so yeah 
102,pretty interesting day today um made some big decision to just stay friends with person that went on one date with i'm feeling relaxed um other than that got some [inaudible] having hard time focusing felt terrible super sick um think have really bad sinus infection or don't know what but we're definitely struggling but yeah just kinda feel like there weight off my chest now i'm not sad probably will be tomorrow but you know other than that try to be productive don't know how to study i'm not feeling super prepared but [inaudible] 
103,okay day today subconsciously coping with losing friend think um got some work done did some studying saw my friend who is pretty awesome told me to believe in myself whatever he just very good friend to have and he struggling bit and wish could advise him as much as he advises me but it is what it is um other than that pretty nonchalant day um dealt with some rooming situations but that all set now so yeah today was really just low-key studying eating studying um didn't really see any of my friends today so it was interesting 
104,um today was pretty laid back just did lots of studying um printed out new practice exam to take today and did terribly on it didn't finish it um but like the multiple choice was just awful and i'm feeling lot of pressure because really need to do well um to get good grade um but just don't know what to do i'm studying i'm reviewing and like maybe i'm just not studying well but also don't know how to study then like it-it just i'm just struggling so tomorrow i'm gonna redo practice exams that did to make sure that remember what did wrong um and yeah and so like feel like know things and in theory could do them but little there little bit of confidence issue and this is for economics um that i'm struggling with but just really need to do well and i'm like praying spending all my time on it and math just really really really really really wanna do well and this has really made me extra determined to do well next semester because this is and don't like this feeling like to do well so yeah i'm just hoping things get better and feel really dumb so over winter break i'm literally going to school i'm going to read and i'm going to write i'm gonna study get ahead of my homework and know say this now but like actually can't do this like just can't so need to get ahead but yeah that really all that been on my mind 
105,pretty good day today um saw the friend that recently said would stay friends with um went pretty well had quick little phone call things are pretty normal and appreciate it lot made me feel good and then have my econ exam tomorrow excited nervous terrified um i'm not confident in anything to ever say that i'm ready for something um but i've definitely put in lot of work so hopefully it pays off but guess we shall see i'm pretty nervous but hope things will end well because need them to um but also worked really really hard and um just really need to do well so that that um yeah i've just really been studying today went to the gym to see my trainer i've been sort of slacking on self-care really need to wash my hair so that gotta happen asap but also have an exam friday so will have time tomorrow to wash my hair probably not will do it anyways well it possible um so yeah hoping yeah just really need to do well tomorrow and that all that really on my mind right now [i'm still] going to bed early wake up early hopefully my roommate is done [inaudible] go to bed um but yeah 
107,um pretty okay day today have math test tomorrow don't really know how feel feel like little um don't know if feel prepared because those tests always kind of take you by landslide but um definitely feel like put in some work more and more worried about econ as the days go on but i'm like not someone who usually worried about grades but people here talk about them lot so it just like has me thinking about them but i'm hoping that things turn out well and that can like really really just really do well next semester um some tension with my dad today definitely some issues with that sector where today he sent message saying that he no longer in the picture so that that and um yeah it not something that unexpected happens lot but it really surprising at this age he still playing these games and i'm 18 years old but other than that nothing really been on my mind other than studying and my friend today said hope you don't come back different from break and that really made me question lot of things as well in terms of like what would change what is staying the same that maybe people like but perhaps don't and what more important in that as well so just been coming across those thoughts recently but honestly i'm just ready to restart next semester 'cause just did so trash this one 
108,um pretty okay day today took my math exam not quite sure how felt about it um i'm worried there worried about my grades but really need to do well want to do well in the class and this has definitely awakened me um and really told me to do better next semester which is what must do and will do without doubt um but yeah other than that now after took my exam finished at 500 just felt pretty relaxed so played some wall ball by myself my other friend here is leaving tomorrow morning saw him for bit my friend who here till like sunday or monday um she writing paper so she very busy so didn't see her but yeah mean it pretty chill day saw some newer friends and yeah now i'm hoping to just read tomorrow having lot of roommate drama lo lot of roommate tension people not being willing to move respect way needs and wants after have sacrificed the whole semester they can't sacrifice one day but you know we're not all adults here guess which is unfortunate but the truth so i'm dealing with that that been i'd say the biggest stress other than my exams on my mind and took my friend out to dinner today um this is the guy that went on date on while ago we decided that wasn't gonna work um had really good time we just have like good comfortable relaxed time when we when it just us but also have like every person telling me that he bad for me so don't know what to do but yeah that about my life 
109,um pretty stressful day today with my roommates um i've had lot of struggle with getting my stuff moved into my single lot of people being very disrespectful very childish and that was something didn't think i'd encounter for long time or really again but was very wrong um and think that'll make me see my roommates in very different light when return um and feel like side of me came out today that never wanna see again it was just rude and not nice and confrontational to an extent that was just aggressive and didn't like that so won't be doing that again but now that the process is over and moved in i'm happy and now i'm home i'm with my cat just wanna relax and read so yeah 
110,um really relaxed day today just walked around with mom lot um saw an old friend which was really great to see we talked about our struggles in college mostly social i'm really scared of my grades and that something that hasn't changed um but i'm like really really nervous and just wanna do really well um but i'm not sure this is the best start but think [inaudible] with [inaudible] please forgive me from my my sins and please help me [inaudible] just kidding just started praying here that how scared was um but yeah i'm like really tired so that probably why just mixed that up as well um but i'm just sort of ready for bed i've been reading some really great books and feel like i've been replenishing my mind with like actual vocabulary and like things to talk about which is good um but yeah other than that it like really chill nothing happens as much um in rhode island but like also just in general compared to when i'm actually at college like there always like multiple things multiple people [seen] and like here that just not happening at all but i'm kind of okay with it for now 
111,um pretty interesting day today spent some time with my dad to pick up my stuff from my dorm um spoke to some friends on the phone uh for really long time on skype um and really happy did in light of reevaluating my friend groups uh think this friend group that just spoke with really stimulates my mind in very different way than my other friends whereas it mostly playful with them and and you know just like cheery laughing being goofy as with these friends can actually have an intellectual discussion and and really really appreciate that and value that and it makes me feel great and it also inspires me to like be the people that we talk about later on like when we see somebody who gonna be really successful like wanna be the person that you think about and like that what we were just talking about and then people on campus and that really strike us as somebody who gonna be something and really wanna be that person um so yeah that just how i'm feeling right now i'm feeling really good about those relationships that i've solidified 
112,um pretty okay day today spent most of my time by myself um woke up pretty early [inaudible] look over the full list [inaudible] i'm just really tired put on some frasier so can go to bed um just went to work out and got my nails done was really by myself and and liked it was relaxed am stressed about my grades don't know if they're gonna be good or bad i'm really nervous about them um but also um am worried about this extracurricular that i'm applying for on top of the many others that have too so that but i'm okay like know wanna do that but yeah 
113,um pretty okay day um sent in an application got asked to interview um was mostly by myself today um when did see my mom we were fine spoke to my dad he upset with me saying that pushed him away while was in college and that basically i've lost him and that things won't be the same which is interesting um and think unfair but not new news from him um so yeah i'm just struggling with that guess was fine until this happened which was very recently like maybe 10-15 minutes ago so yeah um other than that nothing really happened today just sat by myself lot did work that it 
114,um pretty good day today hung out with my friend from high school or really from elementary school which was awesome and definitely spoke about like life decisions i'm making and things and to cut myself some slack but also make change take things easy [inaudible] and she helped me with my social relationship in terms of this guy um yeah she was really helpful and i'm glad spoke to her we just kinda chilled um but yeah i'm hoping to see my other friends even had some conversations with my dad and that didn't go well as usual he saying that should look for support from my friends and not him because things aren't the same anymore so yeah don't even know what to think of that um but that pretty normal for our relationship where he just likes to drop 'cause of things that don't really have control over like my voice probably but you know it is what it is um i'm hurt by it really miss my friends from college and one of them you know speak to them about every day he pretty great but still miss him 'cause don't really like to see him which is interesting and i'm figuring out that really really do like him so we'll see what happens 
115,pretty relaxed day today um spent most of my time with my mom uh went to dinner with her we didn't have lunch but had late breakfast so it fine uh had some discussions about her relationship with my dad christmas and you know whether he gonna be there or not um spoke to my friend today one on facetime and another on the phone as usual spoke to him every day [inaudible] um he mentioned something he saw his ex-girlfriend um and she was basically like she still loves him or whatever and like don't know if he doesn't like her anymore 'cause know he kept saying like he not depressed he over it like the whole like situation but then later on when asked him another question um and we were comparing his relationship his old relationship to our friends he was like she perfect there you know they weren't things to talk about nobody could tell me about her blah blah blah and was just like really heard that and was like hmm are they really done where am in this equation where should be in this equation [inaudible] about that little bit but definitely do like him um but not as friend and yeah we just uh just need to see where things go so this break is just really interesting [inaudible] we'll see 
116,today was okay um woke up worked out and then was with my mom all day and we just went christmas shopping for my dad we drove all the way up to boston then when we called him and made him answer it was sort of like the icing on the cake for him sort of not treating us very nicely um so then we left like as soon as we got there we parked we sat for five minutes and then we left and we went back home then we went shopping for him here and um had another fit over that ended up buying things he got mad at me said he was done with me this is my dad um yeah and he was basically saying i'm distant didn't treat him the same in school blah-blah-blah same thing essentially think he just doesn't like me but at this point don't really like care but know nothing gonna change and so like that was that but um yeah then we went home and ate then spoke to my friend uh who sick in hopes that he feels better we also spoke about um [tanni hificous] and cornel west and that whole debacle and then spoke to my friend on facetime 'cause she going to ghana for the next five weeks so i'll miss her lot and yeah then did some work and i'm going to bed pretty late now but yeah that my day

118,um not terrible day today um spent the morning with my mom opened some gifts it very relaxed day today uh my dad and my cousin came down eventually we went to dinner um and hung out there for bit spent some good time with my cousin things were really awkward and tense with my dad um but spoke to him maybe ten fifteen minutes ago and things seem to be okay now um i've decided to be the bigger person here and just uh recognize well over yesterday and today i'm starting to recognize what mean to other people and that not saying that i'm like this like amazing person or whatever but that like i'm people kid and people have known me from when was young and they're seeing me grow and i'm important to them as they're important to me and so when become distant which is by no means on purpose or when they feel like i'm leaving them they're dealing with the loss that that very serious and very heavy and hadn't really taken that into account and which am now and i'm doing that um after giving someone else the same exact advice which is interesting how your own advice comes back to you buy yeah so that what i've just been dealing with i'm just ready to crack down on school and do really well think this next semester although i've been like thinking lot about boys and things um don't wanna deal with it wanna have friends yeah but i'm not old enough and i'm not ready to be in relationship as much as wanna be um and so need to recognize that and find myself first so that what i'll be doing 
119,pretty good day today um worked out um hang out with my mom all day went to the mall and shopping went to my mom friend house and then came home the day kind of started late so kind of felt [inaudible] that we didn't do much but had good time with her things went well um yeah working on the relationship with my dad um just read something by bell hooks about feminism um it really helping me sort of come up with these conversations on my own and and come up with comebacks and sort of broadening my vocabularies and it giving me the language to discuss these things and these issues of feminist theory um and i'm just really excited to come back to school and like just show people that know what i'm talking about show people that i'm actually smart because think lot of people at school think i'm actually stupid which am only to certain extent um so i'm hoping to be smarter at this upcoming semester and seem smarter as well

144,really great day today got to see all of my friends um which was fantastic um got to get some really good quality time in with my friend um that spoke to over the phone lot almost every day over the break and uh just really connected with we were able to just you know vibe sit there listen to music talk he was talking to me about his ideas for the crimson um which is newspaper and just like we were just chilling which was good um saw some other friends had little bit of not tension but did feel little bit uneasy um at some points just you know and some comments about like them not seeing me over the semester and me being dedicated to my work essentially were just like um overly curious of other friendships that have um and little bit critical so that was that um then had another friend come over and um he basically just said like can come over and bother you for sec and was like sure you know i'm i'm usually always open for emotional support um when people need it just you know to help them out because know what it feels like to not have any outlet for that um so it went well he came over he just sort of talks about this existential crisis he having with being in liminal space yet he he wouldn't explain in between like where the threshold lied guess and the states that he was jumping in between and with him it was sort of tricky because couple of people have told me that he interested in me in as more than friend but don't think he is um so was wondering if he was trying to get something like that off of his chest and just wasn't able to do it um but yeah so was just dealing with that but yeah that about it don't really know what to think of that situation i'm not interested in him like that um but i'm always willing to be friends and to be good friend to anyone who needs it so that what am just going by but yeah 
145,pretty good day today um went to brunch with my friends saw lot of them connected with them saw some great people that hadn't seen in while which was fantastic um it reminded myself of all the relationships i'd like to have and and strengthen um did some homework today which was great it was not due but um i'd like to get ahead um on top of that um just had some good conversations with my friends met with my [path] um and she helped me you know she shed some light on um my workload and and what that gonna look like and if working is good idea um and yeah just like little bit stressed about couple of my relationships with my friends that kind of felt different today but that may just be um me overthinking things as usual um but i'm definitely starting to get little stressed um feeling those chest pains again but watch to make sure that do very well this semester and that i'm happy so will be actively um trying to ensure that these relationships don't have such great impact on my school work or how carry myself and um how just make decisions um so i'm just i'm excited for this semester really really want to do well which is huge um and know how important it is so i'm i'm really ready to dive in i'm gonna hope things turn out well 
146,pretty okay day today had my first classes um like them had conversation with my friend today about like concentration what we wanna be and stuff and left feeling really stressed um knowing that have no idea what wanna do what wanna concentrate in and i'm constantly going towards this thing of trying to fulfill my parent ideal uh me and have job that secures financial independence um but not quite so much fulfillment and really need to change that mindset um but also need to get my life together because there nobody that gonna tell me to do it and there not gonna be moment where i'm like oh guess should do this now like it needs to happen and need to be proactive about it so um that what i'm hoping to do guess but yeah just realized like i'm feeling behind which hate that feeling then spent some time with my usual group of girlfriends um and that was good feel better about the situation in housing and was little bit distracted with them but you know keep it in in short sprints we'll be all right 
147,today was not good day um like nothing bad happened but um as the day went on felt worse and worse about myself um and sort of not knowing what wanna do feeling unprepared um not of caliber um compared to my other classmates and um just in general even if were at regular school um and that makes me sad um it very different from my [inaudible] it sounds terrible but like used to like overachieving or like being that girl um and don't know how to do that here and so that something that has been sort of eating away at me um and so today met with um bureau of study counselor um also met with my advisor and just really realized like don't wanna do computer science whatsoever at all and i'm only doing it because think should be and then realized that i've been doing that my whole life and that i've been untrue to myself and now am feeling the repercussions of that decision um and they're not great and actually feel terrible 'cause i'm behind um don't know what to do with myself i'm not well versed in what i'm interested in because barely know what i'm interested in um and essentially just feel like am child um and i'm immature because always needed structure and didn't quite do things on my own guess you could say when it came to what wanted to do and what felt was my mission or my in-internal compass um and so that was really bothering me and told my dad about it and we walked around and talked about it and had some grub um but yeah so that really how my day went and it just sort of been like weighing down on my shoulders um and it probably will for couple of days probably won't see anyone like that many people for couple of days or just interact as much um do like having single gives me the space to just be here and um wallow really um and hope that that space you know instead of having negative impact on me and allowing me to dwell on my emotions and and self-pity um it'll give me time to reflect and focus and and grow in terms of creating mental space um for discovering who am and what wanna do and unfortunately don't think can rush finding my mission but don't have time and don't want more time yeah i'm just hoping that i'm enough for people for myself for our future um and i'm starting to feel like i'm unlovable as well don't really know where that came from but that definitely happening so yeah 
148,pretty good day today um actually no that lie it was an okay day today um went to um cans today which is mental health services um and had my first meeting um i'm not quite sure how feel about it think um therapy is very interesting because you don't come out of one or two meetings and just have all the solutions to your problems um lot of it is really just getting it out of your system and speaking it into existence so you can actively work against it um so um that was tricky for me just in like spilling lot of information it emotionally exhausting um and it makes you think about these things and usually when have to do that get little down for the rest of the day um and it not intentionally i'm not quite sure why but it definitely does happen and it definitely did today um um but i'm okay and uh one of my friends really picked up on it um when he saw me um and said had to go um was sad was going to huhs and he was like why are you going again um and guess yesterday said have to go to huhs like i'm bored or something um which didn't know said but um yeah so he sort of caught on that i've been going lot and he told me to tell him what wrong and eventually told him that was going to get counseling um and he said why didn't you tell me and said that didn't wanna put that baggage on him 'cause it wasn't fair to him um he didn't really like that argument or understand it but um think one day he will and that okay um right now and then also hung out with another friend today who don't usually hang out with absolutely loved it it was so fun um we got lunch just chilled um wish we could be in more group settings together um which think we will soon and i'm just really happy got to spend some time with her um yeah didn't see my usual group of girlfriends today though but that okay 
149,pretty um okay day still feeling little bit down um spoke to my friend again today um and he just told me that need to not put stress on myself as usual um and um that in doing this i'm [inaudible] me and very inside of myself and it not good um and it not on purpose and it so against what usually do um so it was interesting to hear and something i've been thinking about little bit i'm not mad at him for the comment and don't know if should be but am thinking about it lot and then i'm just hoping could just like really recuperate and get better 'cause it like feel like my brain is sick think it like down and every time i'm in this room in this bed or like someone brings out that they love their classes or they love what they're doing it like bullet and it like really really bothering me because i'm not feeling the same way and all i'm trying to do is feel happy all wanted to do in getting here is be happy and i'm not achieving that and constantly negotiating with what want um and that is not what should be doing but know i'm gonna do it anyways and yeah guess just wish could be as put together um as i'd like to be and know lot of this is like imposter syndrome where people feeling like everybody else is doing well but then and to some extent sure that isn't the case people put up facades obviously safety reasons however part of it is true and know i'm behind in what i'm doing i'm gonna hate myself for that but can't go back in time and can't change the way came up and how deal with emotions unfortunately um so i'm just sort of giving myself couple days to really um just sort of be in myself and really hear everything that i'm telling the little girl in my heart um what was done wrong and what you can change and what you wish you had and it not healthy to do that but think if don't do it then um it'll just keep sitting there and keep growing but really really wanna just like get better and wanna be done with this feeling um so i'm trying to actively you know find what do like um and move forward with that but it is so hard um because just wanna be happy so yeah 
150,um today was pretty good felt okay was happy with my classes and things um felt fine fem felt positive um and another day [where i've got] later and felt little more sad and um was by myself then hung out with guy friend of mine and i'm not sure if there correlation with me feeling sad being after he leaves or just that it happens to be at late hours um but that thing that been happening and now might have to call my other friend who is not upset with me but just um unhappy with um me in terms of staying in touch with him and responding to his phone calls and and text messages um in comparison to the other friend and yeah so that something that have to deal with and have to take accountability for and and it not something that i've done on purpose but um i'm just like don't really know what going on with me i'm just like sad and just lied on my floor for while and didn't sleep didn't cry just like sat there numb hearing my brain so decided to write wrote terrible poem um but nevertheless it poem and i'm not sure if it helping me or not but it kind of felt good it almost distracted me so think i'm gonna try to keep doing that um but yeah [inaudible] do that so well 
151,pretty good um day today not terrible got some work done finished one of my applications went to party danced with couple of people had some interesting interactions um the last interaction with the person that usually am interacting at dances and maybe that was for the better um and was of course sort of like jealous when he danced with other people which isn't good 'cause we're not in relationship we're just friends but it was like don't know but uh now yeah i'm sort of ready to go to bed knowing that have other interests that can pursue um and got into class today that i'm really excited for so i'm gonna do that the class wasn't math and had thought um it gonna be really hard to tell my mom about that because thought she was really for me concentrating on economics and getting job but she seems to not care at all and she didn't understand how concentrating on economics would get me job anyways so it just like really liberating um which is awesome so now i'm taking more classes that like and i'm just really happy about it but yeah 
152,um pretty okay day today went to church this morning it was like sudden impulse it was like 1023 or something and the thing started at 1100 and was like i'm ready i'm ready to be awakened so got up and got dressed as fast as can and ran uh no walked really fast let me not lie walked to the train and saw friend there got to church really liked the church i'm gonna go back i've been sort of questioning religion lot um because my parents were of two different faiths um but really felt happy sitting there and inspired and felt like was learning which was really good um and so that happened then saw my friend um same guy friend that usually see after at brunch um and asked him couple of questions about the party last night which was fine and then um when told him that went to church he wasn't mad he was like playful mad um and was just like why wouldn't you tell me um like would have like gotten up and and gone with you or like this is everything that talk about with you and so when you go you don't tell me um and really felt terrible about that um because it true and like most of the reason that did start was really him because he really embodied religion or christianity felt and wanted to be in that same light um and didn't really think about it because was so impulsive this morning but i'm very bad best friend i'm very bad best friend um just sort of felt really uh yucky about it um and tried to talk to him about it there like what happened at church and stuff and he was like yeah that good but like realize don't know when to tell people things and when to not tell people things um but i'll probably send him message tonight just to say thank you for everything um but yeah and then hung out with him some more went to the bookstore with him to get his books for classes and he said this couple times he said do you ever love someone so much you hate them and like we were like kinda like play fighting the whole time like pushing and and shoving and like saying hate you and was like yeah and we just like had like little moment which is interesting and then we went to his room and did some work then went to meeting for sorority that not sorority anymore um and that was really nice just like talking it was like final round so it was kinda weird 'cause they're kinda testing you but also just having conversation with you which is really weird but um yeah and then went and did homework started it way too late have so much reading uh and won't be able to finish it tonight but i'm gonna try my very best and yeah 'cause need to wake up early as well basically don't know how to say no to my friends still but we're working on it but yeah 
153,um i've just been really busy today just reading getting ahead not even getting ahead catching up on work um probably getting sick from staying up late too often but um yeah everything was fine and then came went to lacrosse which was fun nerve-wracking but good experience um and then uh sort of came home to lot of drama that had been going on in the background about me um and somebody who expressed that they liked me um friend that expressed that he liked me um and had feelings that did not have and that was really frustrating to see um because one was talking about it to my best friends and my best friends didn't say anything to me um and it was because they were like protecting him and like abiding by his wishes which guess shows me how good of friend that they are um but was just sort of like torn you know and um need to figure out how to balance different friend groups better um but also need to learn how to respond to text messages and that problem that have that is continuous um and really need to get on it because it starting to cause issues and don't wanna lose the friends that have and i'm seeing like they already don't have respect for me after this incident so i'm just really stressed now wasn't was just stressed about school and catching up and now i'm like really frustrated not frustrated disappointed 
154,um pretty good day today was able to be pretty productive um had little bit of an incident with my friend um and things are okay didn't see my normal group um but had really interesting class today that i'm really excited for think it'll challenge me um and i'm excited to learn also got into social club today which was very exciting um and that sort of celebration um was exciting and um knew exactly who wanted to tell as soon as it happened which was awesome and yeah it was just like good guess um met counselor today spoke about lot about my issues um yeah don't really know when i'm gonna tell my friends um sort of what going on and if they're willing to help what they could help me with but that gotta happen pretty soon but other than that today was pretty good was pretty distraught after the meeting as usually am but um i'm okay now just really really have to go to bed 
155,pretty great day today would say um got accepted to [redacted] formerly [redacted] um now [redacted] has [redacted] because of sanctions i'm so happy um was really nervous and there was point in the day where really wasn't sure if it was something that wanted um but went to the events and um just realized that like these are normal girls like normal kids and like friends that wanna make and perhaps some experiences that wanna have um they were talking about lot of like things about sex and drinking and they were drinking and it like i've never done that and i've never really had the urge and was able to say no but do think it something that sort of have to do or might i'm not quite sure yet but yeah there is that had paper due at 1200 today it was like three-page response nothing serious but um handed it in at 500 yep and that was rough but yeah did all the reading for it feeling behind schedule so exhausted only got like four hours of sleep last night so we're struggling but yeah i'm just so ready to go to bed 
156,pretty all right day today really tired just wanted to do work um met my friend went over the set with me and that ended up turning into another conversation yet again about our relationship as friends and him having feelings for me and not wanting that to change things and blah blah blah and really i'm just trying to be really productive and find it really difficult to do so here mainly 'cause i'm always surrounded by friends and occasionally it bit frustrating because wanna do really well but at the same know can't quite be successful here in locking myself in my room and that do like when can look back at the day and say yes got work done and i've been productive when i'm not sure i've been able to do that as much as would like to um other than that i've been trying to take shower for the past day and half and haven't and feel disgusting um and yeah i'm just like also craving men right now but i'm also on my period so that that um yeah i'm just like really tired i'm tired i'm going to bed late i'm tired of going to bed feeling like should have done more and i'm just like really over it so yeah 
157,pretty great day today um was really busy didn't get to do lot of work um but did lot of stuff for my sorority thing that not sorority but is sorority um which was good help me make more friends which is important um also um got lot of emails for interviews also got into program at the iop um so i'm really excited about that um feel like i'll be doing things on campus this semester i'm also doing the crimson which i'm so excited for um and i'm just like i'm really happy um and hope that things go well um but yeah i'm just living breathing should have gone to bed like an hour ago but you know doing emails the work never ends but am struggling with making sure i'm doing homework because know [really] need to before fall behind in my classes but yeah 
158,um today started pretty well was busy um running back and forth between conferences and interviews um asked group of my friends to go get berryline tonight which was like ice cream or whatever um and that ended up hurting me lot more than it was helping me thought that it would help me um instead realized that some tension with my friends has sort of culminated into something larger that perhaps they're not recognizing but could definitely feel um and felt like an outsider in group that had called my family um for the past three-plus months um so that was would say intimidating um for sure because had lot of faith um in not only my friends but the process of making friends here um and thought these ones were here to stay and perhaps was wrong perhaps i'm overreacting can't rea quite give an answer at this moment however um do feel like i'm sort of experiencing loss already and think was expecting it to happen um after this person sort of came into our friendship group our friend group and messed things up with expressing interest and then talking to my friends about me those friends not telling me what going on like things like that um and i'm very sad about it and if lose those friends really only have two friends which is so so sad um but i'm glad i'm part of the sorority now maybe this is what need maybe this is learning experience don't quite know um but i'm sad for sure am sad about it 
159,um pretty good day today had two interviews one got there decided didn't wanna do it um and had training from 1000 to 200 which was really fun i'm really excited i'm gonna be student groups liaison for [redacted] former uh mayor of minneapolis i'm just like really excited think this is gonna be great opportunity um and so hope that do really well and succeed and hope that get these other things that i'm applying for as well um but yeah i'm i'm really excited this is gonna be really really busy year or semester but think it will be well worth it um friendships i'm stressed feel like i've lost one of my best friends but that okay well it not okay but like i'm getting through the friend who feel sort of um played large role in the destruction of that friendship and [inaudible] came over and you know said he really didn't wanna do that and that it wasn't his intention or something like he would continue to do um but told him to just do whatever makes him happy um and to just sort of build home here and if that means being friends with my friends that fine because it not binary situation in which only he can be friends with them or can um but it does make things different [inaudible] quick however i'm not mad at him think i'm just mad at the situation and there nothing can do about it miss my friend of course but like it is what it is 
160,pretty good day today i'm super tired just like fell asleep for think it could have been like 10 minutes really don't know um but my body has been so tired yeah i've been fighting it so now i'm just listening and really just going to bed um mostly just got reading done um for today which was nice uh feeling good have to make calendar tomorrow before get to my meeting about my calendar um so that unfortunate but that gonna happen and yeah i'm just like really really tired and need to start getting more sleep and figuring out how to do that hmm [inaudible] that was really it really just did notes on my homework didn't really see lot of friends at all actually not good at that 
161,pretty gloomy day today um not only am getting pimples on my face but um feel like sorta missed out on hanging out with my friends today didn't really see anyone um and didn't get as much work done as wanted to so that was just like double whammy um and guess tomorrow will be doing the same thing except will be getting work done um so i'm just sort of getting used to not seeing my friends as often know saw them way too often last semester so i'm just trying to figure out the happy balance and with being happy and being [inaudible] feeling comfortable um also i'm like trying to go to bed earlier and stuff totally not working having trouble focusing staying on task get sad really wanna use my phone so just take it which is terrible um yeah i'm just wondering [when get] done mess feeling very negative right now hopefully tomorrow will be better but don't really know just felt like don't have fear of missing out just hate missing out and feel like that always happens so don't really know what to do about that other than that like genuinely did not see human beings today other than walking into [redacted] for like 10 minutes tops or seeing people in class that it so yeah it it was struggle today 
162,today has been work work work work work rush rush rush rush rush here there and everywhere had no time to do homework i'm so tired i'm not getting sleep face is breaking out i'm hungry don't even have time to eat and just like it don't know what i'm doing don't know what going on but like need sleep can't afford to have my face be breaking out right now want to do homework and be done at godly hour and go to bed at least wanna go to bed with my homework done and don't even think can do that i'm not frustrated i'm just so tired like wish that just had enough time in the day for these things or that knew what was doing so wouldn't end up like this i'm just like i'm so tired but got initiated today for fleur-de-lis which is for my [redacted] um and there were no sanctions for it so that was really really exciting um it was good moment wanted to feel confident in myself but had this huge pimple on my face so could only feel so much just don't like the way look right now at all like my face is just dying um went to mental health services today for my appointment once again i'm putting lot of pressure on myself need to just relax stop thinking about things i'm pretty sure have an ear infection and it killing me but don't have time to go to the doctor am so nauseous and my ear hurts my ears hurt actually so don't know what to do there either 
163,super busy day today um but felt pretty productive had to do some last-minute preparation and studying for an interview that had but it went well did well in my class today my seminar with the law professor was really happy about um saw some friends um not really loving the interactions i've been having with my friends constantly feel like an outsider um which is super unfortunate um and hate that feeling because know these people were my friends at one point and i'm wondering what sort of going on but also know that they have their own lives as well and i'm not their only friend and perhaps need to do the same thing that they've been doing um so which have um but yeah it just been kind of sad to realize makes me little bit nervous about blocking because i've said i'm gonna block with them already and i'm like pretty keen on it but um if they don't like me by the time that comes it gonna be really awkward and there also um yesterday my friend asked me if like this guy and you know said yes um but like the timing was sorta messed up and she asked if she could like pursue him and didn't really know what to say so she saw me in person today and asked didn't say no but was like like uncomfortable with it and like really wanna pursue him but at the same time know don't know how to do that um so we'll see but yeah so that just like super unfortunate and yeah am like really liking my academic self right now struggling with my social self um if have any friends if will have any friends if i'm just gonna be that girl that always doing something um and if that good or bad thing so don't know i'm little sad i'm actually quite sad but haven't had time to think about it yet so i'm going to bed 'cause don't want to feel emotions ever so yeah 
164,pretty okay day today um woke up meeting went to class had another meeting um then did little bit of work had an interview then did some more work and then hung out with some friends which was really exciting and it felt really good um one 'cause hadn't really hung out with them all week so it was good to see um them and it was just one friend um the friend that was most worried about losing um but things are good which is great and um yeah it was great ending to my day um i'm feeling better now um there lot of uh tension not tension there lot of questioning that needs to happen in terms of who my friends are and who i'm friends with in front of other people um and sort of what friends have considered good friends that have sort of been sabotaging other friendships um the friend that spoke to today that was worried about losing um we went to felipe after whatever and she was like you know rennie said that we call the our group of friends hello and this kid told the girl that just went out to felipe with that he felt that hello was saying goodbye and he said that said that and so didn't say that exactly didn't say hello was saying goodbye um but said you know think they may um leave me soon or like may fall out of that group unfortunately um and he he said that to someone else which was not great um and he didn't even say it to the girl that went to um felipe with he said it to another girl in our group and then that girl told the girl told who the girl went to felipe with then she told me and it just like what are these guys doing like come on it just it was just too much and like he said that like he considered me like his best friend and that like it just the term best friend has sort of been tainted for me in that don't even know what best friend looks like on college campus um which is super worrisome because think i've really defined my my people my happiness my relationships as like friendships and best friends um and that hard to deal with here but it definitely happening um other than that um it was sorta busy today but did feel sorta productive i'm hoping to be really productive tomorrow and go out tomorrow night maybe and then sunday go to church and do work um but i'm happy that today was uh it ended nicely 
165,pretty good day today would say am got into [redacted] which is like really big deal and so was really happy about that um sort of like woke up at like 600 which is equivalent to the middle of the night at this point in my life um and saw the email and was like happy remember laughing and then going back to bed um and then waking up to go again um but yeah so like that was fun was just training all day 1000 to 230 then something at 300 until 500 so [inaudible] really didn't get lot of time to do lot of homework um and also my eye got like really red all of sudden so came back from [redacted] um or urgent care like maybe 20-something minutes ago um oh that was really frustrating had very frustrating experience just because like it was really long wait and was anxious and really wanted to be doing homework but couldn't um [i think] i'm okay and yeah found out that um somebody else is blocking with us and didn't know and the person who blocking with us is the guy that has expressed interest in me um and that like we're not moving forward or anything 'cause like don't find him attractive or like not even that i'm just not attracted to him um so like that that little bit unfortunate quite unfortunate actually um yes that was interesting to to hear about guess by mistake which is awesome um and the other girls in the group they they know about the situation so it was just really interesting how everything playing out but you know keep telling myself i'm not just not gonna be home lot and i'm just gonna be busy which is true am going to make myself busy um but yeah other than that it really busy day same thing tomorrow so we'll see what happens 
166,long day today um still didn't do as much work as had hoped had more training today had presentation in the training that had like 45 minutes to prep for was super nervous um and not even because people were there but because like one of the people that consider very good friend and that what makes me the most nervous don't really like my closest friends to see my academic endeavors because i'm afraid like they won't be enough um and so that was unfortunate and don't think did very well but that okay um got aside my case study for and this training is all for an extracurricular that got into um it like big deal like us haven't gone to the gym in like week and can feel myself getting fat um so need to go but feel like don't have time um but i'm not gonna let last semester happen again so we will be making time for the gym feel so tired for did not get enough sleep but there no time for that um let see other things that happened today super stressful situation with blocking um had thought that we had already set our blocking group uh which is about six of us then um in some group chat this don't know one of my friends um decided or yeah one of them decided that we would be adding this new person in who guy and this guy is guy who expressed interest in me that don't like as as significant other like he an okay person like he good person like him as friend um and didn't know so that was new information that figured out like yesterday or something but then today also realized that that addition to our group wasn't so much of an addition as it was swap and they cut out another friend um and that was hard because as one of the girls in the group that i'm blocking with was texting the other girl saying like no um we sort of set up blocking group was in the same exact room with the other girl and so like it was very very weird and had to like not look at my phone because didn't wanna see any text messages that they could have been sending um it was just so stressful [inaudible] having [inaudible] just decided to have everyone so like both of the people that instead of swapping them we're just keeping both of them and am not happy about it have to say not happy um but feel like don't really have input mean do have input but it not worth my time so yeah now i'm just ready to go to bed do work in the school kid let me just do school really well you know so that what i'm gonna do

170,pretty okay day today um my friends got into some programs for studying abroad which didn't even know about didn't even know it was on the table so that was something that was really sad 'cause think it would've been something that would've loved to do um and unfortunately didn't know about the opportunity um which is really really unfortunate but can't really change that i'm worried about summer opportunities and hope things go really well um i'm just like super nervous about it 'cause really really really really really want to do something incredible you know and it lot of pressure to put on myself especially as freshman but kinda don't care um and have high expectations from myself and and think that worked for me um so yeah i'm just really worried about summer opportunities just wanna do something incredible something important um but yeah it really all that been on my mind just did lot of work on my [p-set] today um thursdays are my busiest days had an interview at 940 classroom 1000 to 1100 another classroom 1200 to 100 don't know 211 class 1100 to 1200 another class 100 to 300 had to be at study group for 415 for what do at the [redacted] um and that one till 545 then had to have meeting for the [redacted] at 700 and then worked on finishing the [p-set] and sort of like had the answers but wanted to do it and understand it uh so that what just spent the past like three hours doing um and so didn't do any other homework which is super disappointing but um yeah hopefully things get better 
171,pretty okay day today again this pattern of not getting as much work done as had hoped um went to class had meeting after that did work i've been struggling with one of my essays um have like three essays to do which is just so exciting and all 480-something pages of the book to read um so i'm really struggling with coursework and just staying on top of things been getting ahead it was okay now i'm not so need to figure that out again um let see and yeah had banquet tonight also went to party and um yeah so just like met lot of people partied with different types of people different people don't usually hang out with so that was exciting the experience different type of uh uh but yeah i'm just living i'm super tired but i'm going to try to read in bed before go to bed and yeah well also shopped today lot 
172,um today spent most of my time by myself was doing homework struggling with paper reading book um yeah again not getting the work that need to get done accomplished um struggling with time struggling with focusing uh which is huge issue need to figure it out but yeah i'm just like tired i'm gonna read before go to bed try to go to church in the morning so yeah 
173,absolutely exhausted um so much work to do paper do at o'clock tomorrow haven't even finished reading for it have to study for econ just like this is just terrible and i'm just so exhausted need to sleep um there just way too much on my plate right now tired like my eyes are burning like it took me like 15 minutes to read like page and half because the words were like getting blurry and stuff so really need to figure out my life and get my life together but i'm ready to go to bed now and it'd be done 
174,um today was busy woke up finished reading wrote response paper that was due at 400 got it done by like 1130 um then went to training that was from oh no maybe got it done at 1200 or something then went to training that was from 100 to 330 went to record music video from 330 to like 500 something then at 800 went to meeting from 600 to 830 then 630 to 830 excuse me and then went to the study session from 745 or 800 to 930 then did my homework where had slide to make for [accg] which is lot of research essentially and then did some no yeah that uh super unfortunate terrible time management and then am behind and have another paper due on wednesday at 1200 but also have an exam on wednesday so we're [welding] lot and i'm so stressed but also need to sleep and i'm supposed to be reading this thing right now but think i'm going to read it so can fall asleep and then wake up ready and go print to do homework that due tomorrow at 10 o'clock um that couldn't do because don't have printer because i'm not paying um even though tomorrow will have to pay despite the fact that am broke um let me think yeah so will be cramming for the next three days um absolutely and it gonna be such an experience hate this schedule right now um but also feels really productive so don't know what to do with my life essentially 
175,super tired once again um lots of work to do have to finish in the morning and wash it up but that what it is [inaudible] first today saw some friends that don't usually hang out with one on one or whatever but like really liked being with them which was awesome so that gonna help me in terms of making new friends um yeah just tired and can like barely keep my eyes open which is why i'm going to bed and was gonna read but it just not the information is not remaining in my head so yeah i'm just ready to sleep um really just like studied and did homework today had two meetings in class and that was it didn't have lunch not having three meals day anymore which is don't know is okay guess but not something love but feel like am gaining weight so it may be good that i'm not eating don't know 
176,um today was was okay it was beautiful outside so felt happy in the morning did work went to see my counselor and then went to class and studied then took my econ exam don't feel good about it at all feel like study for that class and it doesn't do anything so i'm really frustrated um and don't know how to fix anything so i'm really upset about that but am just moving forward not thinking about it being done um yeah so i'm just like you know i've cut econ out for good and i'm going to bed early because like my eyes hurt and haven't been getting enough sleep um and totally have work to do have an entire op-ed to write for the crimson due tomorrow at 700 have started absolutely not so i'll be getting at least six six and half hours of sleep tonight because i've only been getting like five something which is terrible um so could wake up early do work but yeah so have to go because thursdays have absolutely no time to do anything so yeah i'm exhausted and disappointed in myself 
177,really tired ready to go to bed wanted to read two chapters for econ only got through one it was so long it was like 20 or 30 pages um of text but so that was unfortunate and also had to take shower just 'cause really needed to shower super stressful day had lot of work working before deadlines just not like an ideal day and so yeah was tired really frustrated got to call my dad tomorrow 'cause didn't snap at him today but felt kind of not nice and didn't like that so think he [inaudible] um yeah don't know i'm just i'm stressed but i'm not stressed but know should be stressed so guess have lot of work to do and there are no hours in the day that could let me get me ahead so just need to figure out how to do that and think i'm just going to stop seeing people and just be by myself all the time and maybe that'll help me grow and be productive so yeah 
178,have lot to do today i'm going to bed way too late way way way too late but of course [inaudible] um i'm super tired getting sick from being tired like literally sick um my [life] is mess my eyes are getting red feel like i'm getting pink eye um have like stuffed nose um i'm exhausted i've lost my appetite get dizzy um yeah so life is going not-so-great have to do work for 130 tomorrow um at this rate don't think i'll be waking up until 1000 because need to get sleep i'm like so over it but also need to do my nair [nails] um which opens at 1000 so i'm really just struggling like immensely um so yeah life sucks right now um not feeling good about schoolwork but you know that not different from any other time 
179,today was interesting um woke up in the morning had to get my nails done for ball we had tonight um did that did some work went to brunch did little bit more work and then got ready for this ball which was pretty underwhelming and disappointing but um you know it is what it is got some better connections with guy i'm interested in which was good um realized that one of my friends that friend has expressed interest in me but that didn't really feel back for him uh like i'm not interested in him but he like really good person and really like having him as friend um yeah felt like wanted to be really dressy and really like pop out for this event um and didn't feel as dressed up or felt dressed up but didn't feel like was as pretty as those around me and think lot of it roots from searching or only really believing that look pretty because other people tell me or in other words validation from others um which is terrible terrible thing had really good conversation with my friend la this tonight which is pretty helpful not really having me solve my problems but in saying that other people are in the same boat as well where they don't feel like they exactly belong at harvard and things um yeah was gonna go to the afterparty then decided not to just just didn't feel like it so me and two other friends went to jefe and then we went and we watched this like nigerian movie so you know things happened but i'm just exhausted and have to wake up to go to church tomorrow so just ready for bed 
180,really tired going to bed kind of early tonight so can wake up early and do work planning to meet with my professor or tf so we can work on economics together i'm feeling really worried about um summer plans and not knowing any professors here um my friend is basically got an internship with his professor to do some research which is absolutely fantastic and wished that had connected with someone like that you know but it okay i've just got to keep trying keep going i'm nervous but think it'll be okay i'm just so exhausted so i'm going to go to bed because just went to church this morning then did work then went to dinner and then did more work i'm having really hard time focusing which is really bad 
181,so one class took lot longer than i'd hoped um [inaudible] doing work and now i'm sort of worried to walk into my [inaudible] class tomorrow but essay barely changed um however we'll see how things go what was supposed to do don't even know um so have to wake up early tomorrow um yeah so i'm gonna get about five hours of sleep not good but we're working on it and this won't happen again think i'm gonna go to the library from now on to study so i'm excited for that um think i'll be more productive and focused and yeah i'm just really looking forward to go to bed so can wake up and do my work have something due at 500 tomorrow that i've barely started so that for an extracurricular considered quitting the crimson today um because really have no time for it but the people really really like me and really want me to write and totally understand me quitting but their enthusiasm about my writing has sort of pushed me to do lot now so don't have to do it later so i'm excited 
182,pretty good day today was pretty productive got lot of work done ready to do the same thing tomorrow um spoke with some of my friends last night little bit today just about um my endeavours in to in terms of finding relationship or being in relationship think that something that want so i'm don't know if i'm actively looking but am currently aware that that what want um and so spoke to friend of mine who pretty close friends with two guys that would be interested in um so that just an interesting thing that sort of hanging around the back of my mind um buy yeah don't really know um just sort of going through think i'm just gonna see what happens um let see yeah that really it didn't see lot of people today except for one friend um who sort of was having trouble with in the middle of don't know guess the in-between part of last semester and this semester but like really think he really good friend and think forgot that um and don't don't think ever wanna lose him as friend he just very good person so that just not gonna happen so i'm happy i've come to that realization getting annoyed by another friend group that have um with someone who giving me lot of trouble and stress um but somehow felt like owed um and i'm like really over that mentality now so yeah i'm just very aware ready to do well here i'm psycha excited 
183,um today has been okay had lot of work lot of meetings to go to to figure out who my big would be um so yeah that was just that that took up lot of my time today hopefully won't have to waste that much time ever again so have so much work think have to drop an extracurricular um yeah it it gonna happen my skin is super dry um am not getting as much sleep as would like to um i'm not thriving but i'm getting things done um yeah surviving not thriving breathing um but yeah i'd say overall today actually wasn't like terrible day do feel like there little bit of tension with one of my friends but i've decided that i'm just like i'm not gonna care and i'm not gonna do anything about it and like if she wants to be friends if she wants to fix things like she'll come because last time we had like little thing it was like only me that cared so am just gonna let things happen whatever occurs occurs if she doesn't wanna fix it that'll be awkward but it'll pass even though we'll be living together it okay um we'll get through it you know so i'm just gonna wait that out and see what happens 
184,pretty good day today um went to bed late last night woke up had meeting at 930 went really well i'm excited for paper that i'm gonna write think it gonna be really cool it gonna be really great um caught the crimson today um which is one thing that was confident that definitely didn't have time for um and think made the right decision it sad um but think i'm still gonna send in pieces and let see um yeah just basically worked on my econ set so um i'd actually done most of it throughout the week and there was just one more problem that had and it had 25 parts to it um and it was like sort of the longest question there um but it like doing excel and things so it not like it not too terrible um that what spent most of my time doing um so it really wasn't that bad wasn't don't know if i'd consider it cramming but um it was due tomorrow it is due tomorrow um got into two summer programs today um one an internship to peru the other one to mexico um in mexico city so was really excited about that when saw uh the first one actually like shed couple of tears um which was really exciting 'cause was really nervous about it and afraid that wasn't gonna have anything for the summer when shared that information with my parents didn't quite get the response that i'd expected um but in hindsight really should've expected um their reactions as anything abroad really just scares them um but yeah so mean that that we'll see what happens but met someone really cool today um so i'm hoping to email them to maybe um have the opportunity to work with them over the summer perhaps um yeah i'm just i'm i'm excited things are like coming together i'm feeling better about econ was able to do some parts by myself which was good um have lot of emails to do didn't get as much work done today as wanted but feel accomplished with the set so i'm happy 
186,um today was pretty busy and again had meetings and went to two events didn't get lot of homework done or nearly as much as i'd hoped um but again just gonna have another long night and my mom is coming down tomorrow so i'm really excited to see her haven't seen her in while feel like haven't spoken to her in while either so i'm excited for that and just to tell her how things have been going here um had meeting with an extra-curricular group that i'm in um where we do work for like other companies and expressed some frustration with the work that they were giving me in that they're not really giving me clear assignments and then they're also not using the work that give which takes quite some time some three to five hours would say um and so that was really frustrating so emailed um my like higher person about it so we'll see what happens about that but i'm glad that that on the table now um i'm interested in someone here who not someone that i'm like friends with particularly um but like hope things go well he looking for as they say like wife now he not trying to mess around anymore uh i'm not just trying to be side piece so that nice um guess we'll see where things go haven't really like did math with him last semester so like we like can converse but um i'm not like close with him but maybe that'll change so that thing that been on my mind um think that pretty much it yeah feeling like i'm not i'm in like sorority that not sorority anymore and feel like i'm not quite participating in it as much as should be but met someone today um who also like part of it and had never met her um but she is part of it and is not very involved and she like fine and was like okay maybe now is just not the right time 
187,really tired ready to go to bed so i've lot of work to do i'm finished reading for one class today but didn't finish the paper which is due tomorrow at 400 so need to get that done also i'm the only person responding and feel like i'm the only person doing things in my um iop student group so that really annoying soon i'm gonna have to wake up early and bring [redacted] to [redacted] but yeah i'm just super frustrated with that but you know that that um i'm over everything am over one of my friends he was just so annoying today and got really frustrated with him um and like in the back of my mind know i've been like sort of drifting away from him and it not that it was on purpose but i'm happier think when i'm just you know chilling without him and that sounds bad but that not really what mean 'cause like these past couple days have been fine they've been little bit less stress than normal and don't know if that because of him or not and um he had today just really got me really upset and didn't really know what to do one of my um actual guests for the iop who i'm liaising for um brought in guest who mentioned something during her 12-step recovery plan um to addiction um about telling certain people certain things like you know really love you and care about you um but this isn't working for me and there have to be consequences for you hurting me um and that has been coming back to me lot especially in relation to this guy and and like we're friends and that the issue we're just friends and feel the stress with him which is really annoying um but yeah it just like it ridiculous and it keeps coming to my head whether should you know say something like that to him but i'll have to choose if i'm gonna say hey like care about you love you but can't be friends because it hurting me or say there are certain there are you know consequences for hurting me um and that may constitute me like leaving the room or like not talking to him and that feels sort of terrible um because it feels like i'm like punishing him which makes like puts me on pedestal that we all know i'm not on um then also [inaudible] sort of like mother and child like just like it just really weird that not what wanna do but also do need to protect myself and think it important to tell him hey like there are some things just can't deal with with what you do and sometimes i'm really gonna have to walk out or walk away from you um because can't deal with it so prob don't know maybe that'll happen soon 
188,pretty unproductive day today supposed to be light day where had um time didn't feel like got any of the work done that i'd hoped to which was super disappointing yet something that feel like am constantly saying so think will be isolating myself for the next couple of days um until [housing day] so yeah just getting through until spring break but i'm just super tired need to go to bed need to stop wasting time and to do homework by myself um and that it that just it that it 
189,okay day today uh did essentially one piece of work tried to but nothing new i'm really tired i'm ready to go to bed i'm having awful awful cramps so um on top of struggling to focus i'm in lot of pain um don't take medicine but i've been taking medicine and it not helping as much as i'd hope it would um so think that been part of my struggle today of just really staying focused unfortunately housing day is on thursday today is technically wednesday um and am excited have been kind of awkward with um one of my future blockmates um and we were really really close before and think things have fallen apart i'm not sure if there'll ever be they will ever be normal um but you know at this point can't really do anything about it and if she doesn't want to you know be friend i'm not gonna force her to do that um because think everyone deserves to be happy and then not have the weight of trying to please someone and that not fulfilling to you so am i'm just gonna let that go and just see what happens try to be as neutral as possible but um other than that am super ready to go to bed so that what i'm doing now and when wake up in the morning and go to tutoring go to class and then try to get as much work done as possible and before tomorrow night 
190,pretty okay day today um about to go to bed sleeping with my block mates right now um and yeah haven't felt too great about my relationship with one of the girls in my [blocking] group um really really wanna be friends with her like we were but i'm not sure if that feeling is reciprocated but yeah so i'm just gonna go to bed now sleep it off see what happens what'll happen will happen have faith in the process excited for tomorrow it supposed to be good day so i'm just gonna stay positive 
191,pretty okay day today got my housing assignment i'm in [redacted] um think decided that will not block with my won't room with my block mates but we'll be in the same house which is nice um yeah had conversation with friend today who actually in my blocking group that haven't really spoken to for little over week which is lot for us and that lot for harvard think um and she just sort of explained that our group of friends sort of the things that we have been talking about lately which guess has been mostly guys has been um an uncomfortable experience for her where um she sort of feels like she can't relate um and it something that stresses her out and she doesn't feel like we're people that she can talk to about her struggles with that so she been very distant um and obviously as would say one of the people that are closest to her in the group um was the first to notice and had reached out while ago to see if she was okay and she just sort of blew me off um and so you know after spending the night together and then um having another awkward interaction today she sent text message uh asking for us to like meet and figure out why things are still awkward and so that happened and started just to let her talk 'cause didn't really have much to say didn't want to say anything 'cause think was mad and and didn't even know um but she really expressed just not feeling one with the group of friends that we've made she feels like she can't talk to us about her issues which is which was sad to me because always felt like was that person for her um for the past six months at least um so that was hard for me to take because felt like not only had been terrible friend but thought was doing better um and it like it just didn't matter like the history that we had and the times that we have shared um really deep and important things with each other it was like that sort of all blew away um and so you know as she saying this i'm on my period and it hasn't been this bad in really long time so part of it think may be that um but have been like not quite getting panic attacks but like have to leave the situation start sweating and start breathing heavy and like sometimes cry sometimes just walk around like don't know um and like i've been shaking for like two days now which is fantastic um but essentially she said those things and all those thoughts started flooding into my head and said okay um wow and left the room and after left the room sat on the stairs and cried for bit and started sweating then texted friend who also lives in the same building to see if he was there and tried to talk to him he also made me feel worse about myself which was interesting um and for some reason stayed because don't put myself before others and then today um another friend who also in the blocking group told me that um his mom just um found out that she had kidney cancer um first stage very early on um but that was something that he was really dealing with um and so tried to help him with that too so there lot of information coming in um today and don't really know what to do about it 
193,pretty okay day today um sat in car for most of the time just traveling from [redacted] to north carolina we're currently in [redacted] um i'm doing trip for habitat humanity so we're just really in the process of travel right now um had some good conversations with my friend feeling not great about my body right now um feeling overweight but we're getting through it hopefully things will get better i'm excited for this um opportunity and think i'm gonna make some new friends which is good um yeah pr just ready for tomorrow gotta sleep though

202,um today started fine sort of felt my mood drop tell me about the campus don't wanna be here but am but let see started okay um didn't actively avoid um male friend that had been giving me lot of stress um before break but just didn't give him lot of my time or the time that usually give him and then think that they that may have been the last straw for him where he had been asking me lot like what wrong like did do something wrong are you mad at me and kept saying no because like didn't wanna talk about it didn't wanna make big deal out of it um but met with him today and just speak about it and wasn't really able to say lot in person which is something that really struggle with where don't i'm not used to saying how feel um so it really hard for me and the thing is that can do it with other people but with him for some reason just can't and can't tell him that either um but yeah uh so that in person did not end very well um where told him that yeah was having like little breakdown um it was it was like little bit of panic attack um friday before we left thu-thursday um and yeah thursday and asked if he was home to say hi or whatever didn't know when he was leaving and he kept badgering me about what was wrong like why was stressed why had been crying before and now i'm fine and said don't wanna talk about it multiple times and then eventually told him and he like interrupted me while was talking and was like oh so you just came to right your wrongs it was like that wa that really frustrated me lot and and so today had mentioned that as one of the several things that he'd done that really um made me angry and reminded me of home um just like the stress felt there of like even when do what i'm told i'm still wrong and when told him today um after over text message which am not supposed to be doing my therapist said for me to do these things in person and not over text message to bolster my skills um that he knows me he knows my background he knows like what i'm able to do and what i'm not and so don't understand how he doesn't know when he does something wrong and and don't understand why he thinks that it okay in to keep pushing me to share these things and then not even apologize when he does something wrong so that was sad he ended up apologizing over text message um after explained to him lot of what was frustrating me so that was emotionally taxing for bit and made it hard to focus but i'm just gonna go to bed now finished um my reading for my seminar tomorrow have lot of work to do lot lot of things so have to do that as well 
203,um really really tired um it was very productive today though didn't get everything off of my list um but definitely got good chunk um of what needed to get done which which it was good um meeting with my friend tomorrow um because we've been really awkward even before break um and we haven't really been able to get back to our norm and like today just was really bothered by it um and think she saw that was bothered um and asked me about it over text message and then we decided to get breakfast tomorrow morning um to just like talk and like get back to normal so hopefully that goes well um hate going to bed this late but like got stuff done um and think i'm just going to isolate myself um which isn't healthy but it'll let me be productive and at least i'll be good student if i'm not great happy human being um so yeah feel good about that really wanna go to bed 'cause have to wake up at 800 um super unsustainable lifestyle though and need to study for economics but have yet to do that which is terrifying 'cause really need to do well and yeah so those are just like the things that are on my mind right now and yeah that about it but hopefully tomorrow will be better 
204,today was okay i'm just going to bed now which is really bad um got some of my paper done um did an application oh so we're struggling for the next couple of days but it'll be okay i'm going to not see anyone tomorrow and not do anything tomorrow but sleep and do homework and go to one event but have to or go to the classes that have to and then that it and really just not um dealing with it but it'll be okay everything gonna be fine i'm gonna get through it tomorrow just gonna be really really really hard day but i'm gonna sleep sleep sleep and things will be good just have to get through this week and study for econ 
205,um long day again today super tired still not done with two things due tomorrow uh hate this feeling haven't had time to study for econ it just like the same things are happening over and over again just don't know what to do but today my group that am the executive developer for had competition which they won and now they're gonna [inaudible] [yard] fest which is fantastic um but yeah so that was good but now i'm super tired need to sleep 
206,pretty good day today um finished paper uh that was pretty important to me it pretty big really liked it it was [card] but now that it over i'm really glad did it think it big stepping stone um also worked with [redacted] which is group that i'm part of part of um and just sort of like saw more faces got to meet more faces which was great um really like this guy and so i'm trying to figure out you know how to like manoeuvre that situation um woke up this morning and finished my [p-set] that was due at 1200 and then after that went to career fair and after that went to take photos for [redacted] then did work and then went to the gym then then went to surprise birthday party for like tw 15 20 minutes then went to the gym then did work had dinner was supposed to be at then was late to my [big little] reveal and then worked on my essay and finished it about an hour and change before it was done mean due so it been like go go go day but now that that essay is done really feel like want to be able to breathe but know can't because have to study for econ but things just feel better um so i'm ready to be really productive tomorrow um which always say and we all know what happens but tomorrow i'm gonna try hard um but i'm getting sleep tonight need to catch up on the sleep so i'm not setting an alarm [inaudible] yeah that my day 
207,pretty good day today was very productive and studied essentially all day or good portion of the day for economics which felt good still have lot more to do but i'm feeling more and more prepared which is awesome and spoke little to some other uh friends um and for the past like three three and half hours was speaking with two friends that got close with and think still am close with um and it was really nice to talk to them had good time with them which is great yeah we talking about rooming and blogging and i'm not going to room with my blogging group but will be maybe rooming with one of the girls in the blogging group who was added last minute um just because there lot of tension and not within our group but there lot of potential tension and don't need that don't want to come home to that so yeah that that and we spoke lot about how one of our mutual friends sort of made us feel and sort of the issues um that we have with him and what his actions um evoked so that was just really interesting discussion to have but now i'm going to bed um because have to go to church tomorrow so yeah 
208,um today was an interesting day was excited to go to church went to church had great experience um got to brunch saw two friends on the way there had really funny conversation walked in made waffle had really fun conversation um with guy i'm really interested in which was great sat by myself to eat was excited to just dine and dash then um friend came over who i've been really close with um guy friend i've been really close with um and he sort of like put his tray down and was like we need to talk we have problem um and didn't answer any of his calls last night because feel like he been putting lot of emotional strain um in my day-to-day life and and it not that he doing anything wrong um think i'm just inco unconfident and um it it hard on me because he there're certain things that he does that reminds me of my dad and it not like it triggering but it-it something that i've been trained to stay away from and say that in quotes because my mom has always been very forward about saying um about being able to recognize those traits and um to just just have eyes open at all times and since seeing those guess have been distancing myself lately um this conversation we have still don't know how productive it was um we definitely got like not frustrated or yelling at each other or anything like that but like impassioned um about what we were saying and think it was eye-opening for him told him that he didn't think he thought was smart or had any mental capacities um and he was really taken aback by that um and was surprised at his reaction because genuinely think that he does not think i'm smart and didn't say this but in my mind felt like if were if weren't attractive to him he wouldn't talk to me and um that sorta scared me and just other things that have happened within our relationship have made me really tense so in distancing myself guess i've been little bit less stressed but um i've been putting stress on him i'm really important friend to him and he very important friend to me and um think now may be at risk of losing that friendship which is really unfortunate um and hope not and sent text after our discussion just saying like know things are tense but lot of it is just me and my self-esteem and so i'm sorry and hope we can work things out and he never responded and know he was just paying me back because didn't respond to text that he sent um that was apologizing but yeah so i've just been thinking about that bit i'm not sure what to do but um guess that what been on my mind 
209,today um easily one of the worst days i've had um lot of things [inaudible] with blocking group um had mentioned that wasn't sure if wanted to room with him everything went down from there people say he fucked us over he screwed us over um no one was gonna say anything uh because [inaudible] um just like all these things um then had panic attack and then um my friend who in the group who also mentioned that he may not be rooming with him found me took me to his room and has calmed me down bit just sat there shaking for quite some time and texted one of the girls outside of the group chat that i'm closest to um just said really needed her went to room 13 to get help um yeah uh terrible terrible terrible day also got like little bit of closure with other guy friend um i'm thinking this week i'm just going to stay in my room not going anywhere i'm not seeing anyone not eating not like none of that um yeah i'm i'm in really really low spot right now so i'm just gonna probably cry myself to sleep 
210,today was really really interesting day went to be so depressed last night woke up pretty depressed um had one meal today that my dad delivered and um stayed in the library all day didn't talk to anyone and messaged few few people over text um just to really apologize for like the blocking group situation and ask if could block with them um yeah so that was really interesting i'll probably do it again tomorrow but um texted one girl that i'm very close with in the blocking group we haven't been close for little bit because some things were going down guess don't know um and we had really really i'll say it was good heart-to-heart um and she sort of like ignored me or like uh cut me out for some time this semester it really really did hurt me and don't think she knew that until today um and like she knew like it had an impact on me think but not to the extent that it did mean she felt bad um about how she acted throughout the whole thing because she said like she could see that was sad like visibly in our class that we had together and like people asked her about it and people asked why we didn't hang out that much anymore people that didn't see us together very often um and you know when told her like that i'm getting panic attacks and i'm just depressed and [inaudible] and just like lie in corner in my bed um think that was her realization and she felt like in seeing me sad and and not doing anything she was being bad friend and it was not an an accurate reflection of how she defined friends and so she cried we cried about that for while um tried to tell her that it wasn't her fault and that was bad friend too and that couldn't be the person that she needed um in terms of support but it was like very interesting conversation and it was learning experience for me um in terms of like people saying like messed up like yeah and apologize for that and like really meaning it and what that looks like um it was really interesting and she was like really really upset with herself and tried to comfort her but she didn't want that she felt like she wasn't supposed to be the attention right now and that um she was she didn't deserve to be comforted and that was hard to see but it ended well things are fine now and hopefully they'll get better so another member of the blocking group and things are okay so things have improved but i'm still not gonna see anyone tomorrow and i'm just prepping for my exam tomorrow night 
211,really really really late night need to go to bed have o'clock meeting in the morning um just really had lot of work to do and mid-term that was sitting for um all my work is sort of overloading am [inaudible] and didn't sleep which is terrible just like really really don't like it um so that will be fixed this weekend um will be ahead of schedule it just gonna happen um but yeah really ready to go to bed um interesting social interactions today had meeting with the group that i'm part of um there little bit of tension and one of my close friends um messaged me and just said that you know he wished that i'd stood up for him um and that didn't do good job of that and this is someone that recently had conversation with saying that that some of the things that he does makes me feel not so great about myself um and he characterized it as him being bad friend but think it just him being little bit um unaware of how he makes others feel but that work in progress um so it just interesting to hear that um being said to me while someone else yesterday ra made that realization themselves about how they were treating me and so that just really really interesting um and apologized for that and and taking responsibility um but yeah just super weird liking this guy lot lot thinking that he may well i've heard that he may just give up in my until next semester um which is really really unfortunate 'cause really like him but you know it is what it is guess 
212,today um felt pretty isolated would say um didn't realize that was like actively avoiding people until went to um the [institute of politics] today to do quick thing before had separate meeting and changed my route twice to avoid people um and then on top of that when was there was just like hit with sadness where could see it on my face you can see it um and [it was to start a] book wanted to get out didn't want to be around people di just didn't wanna do it um yeah so that was really hard really interesting to see then met with my donor which was really amazing um with the scholarship donor guess really awesome people from rhode island felt at home for little bit felt comfy felt happy [felt ready] um the daughter goes to law school here and she sort of gave me some great words of wisdom to uh just make sure get really good grades here um then got back from classroom-to-table thing with my professor and someone asked about rooming i've decided to room with the blocking group um and then find out that um three of them three of the other girls um are at birthday dinner for one of the upperclassmen um she sophomore guess um that also know um and was not invited but they were all there um they had all sort of been in cahoots um guess and in filling out their blocking form they left one girl out because they wanted quad and then left her out because don't want to room with her boyfriend as well but um yeah that was really interesting to see and was sad so threw my phone somewhere else that was so wouldn't look at the snapchat stories anymore um but it just really interesting to hear people who are worried about divisions in the group go about doing things that only include certain people in the group but yeah that that guess 
213,today was pretty interesting day had conversation with someone for internship this morning decided that i'll be going to [redacted] this summer um which is good little nerve-wracking um tried to get work done had lot of meetings was super unsuccessful in getting any work done um feeling don't know how i'm feeling right now um drank today tried like don't even know what it was maybe shot or something um it was fine it was fine with it with my friends um it was like normal guess went to two different parties um and don't know like was fine with it was like it not necessarily something that would like crave or really do again because want to um but did want to like know what it felt like um but saw lot of my friends that he considered pretty close um and like think he could tell that had drank mean he was like very very just um don't know he was really standoffish he like actively avoided me it was really really interesting um but he also someone that feel like is unhealthy for me um and is not doesn't quite have positive impact on me at all but mostly what happened today um yeah also danced with guy that like so hopefully that goes well um yeah so it was like good and bad talked about my parents today but yeah so think things are little off with my dad so i'm going to try to fix that but yeah that it 
214,today was pretty good day um woke up got reasonable amount of sleep um played myself and said was gonna do homework and went to the gym instead and then did went to breakfastlunch and did little bit more homework and sat with friend um and it was good to just have conversation with him about how things are going how his night was 'cause hadn't seen him and then um from there went to an even with one of the organizations that i'm in um where it was lot of effort just to like talk to people and make small talk 'cause didn't really care for the people that were there um and found some of them just like really annoying as much as wanted to relate to them and when got home um contacted my dad to go to another um religious event and that was sort of stressful um just sitting there knowing that that not gonna be religion that practice and that um still have to interact with those people as if it something i'm really considering um so yeah that was just like lot of effort and think it was very noticeable that was uncomfortable and was pretty like angry about the things that were being said um but yeah then came back home did work and then um friend contacted me to get ice cream and i'm pretty into him so that was cool um was somehow outgoing which never happens so that was new but yeah and then went to see my friend and now i'm here with them and yeah i'm just gonna go to sleep and go to church tomorrow and try to be as productive as possible 
215,today was pretty rough um went to church got phone call from my dad while was there he didn't know that was like going to churches or whatever um that didn't go very well and he eventually decided to try to meet with me later and discuss religion essentially as whole um and we're that was where he told me that he doesn't really he not very good at practicing his own religion and that he doesn't want me to deal with religion at this point in my life um and disgree with that he he just wants me to focus on school and he thinks that religious people are very manipulative um so that was really interesting conversation to have spoke i've spoken to my friend that i'm pretty close to who guy who seem to always talk about unfortunately um and feel sad but don't know what supposed to happen there so i'm just gonna let things happen and yeah really tired had lot of work didn't finish it spent lot of time dealing with emotional things with my dad um yeah so now i'm just really ready to go to bed 
216,wasn't terrible day today went to the gym this morning um went to class i'm little behind the econ then had was on my way back from the gym learned that had like three other meetings today that didn't know about so went to those and didn't have the time thought had to do the work that needed to do either way got some good work done um well now that think about it got got work done there are things that are finished um have to watch movie i'm gonna watch little bit now and then i'm gonna watch the rest in the morning it for class at 10 o'clock tomorrow but yeah wonder what my friend [inaudible] feel like i'm losing who was close to early in the semester and last semester but i'm gonna let things happen it like was looking for signs and really like someone to be telling me that like he not good for me just gotta drop people so that that and yeah so now on my way to bed leaving the library and i'm super tired and i'm just gonna try to really focus on school have presentation on thursday so i'm just compartmentalizing my emotions and it working so well oh my goodness feel relaxed feel like rock love it so yeah

220,um really long day today um didn't get that much sleep last night and started early this morning for 1000 meeting wasn't as productive as i'd hoped to be after classes and meetings and interviews um which is really really unfortunate um so i'm planning to be super productive tomorrow but also am planning on sleeping i'm not setting an alarm um think need to give my body break um know do have lot of work but at the same time can't uh we went to party today and some girls wanted some drinks so they drank and one of my friends um she didn't even drink that much but guess it was just too much for her and she was really sad about some thing you know subconsciously that she'd been trying to push push away and sort of heal from um she got really drunk and was really really sad at the party and saw her sitting by herself went to go get her and she sort of fell on me and she cried and she cried and she said this guy doesn't love her and she couldn't understand why and was sad was so saddened by the pain that she felt and was so angry that someone had made her feel that way and was okay um and didn't really know how much of that to attribute to the amount of drinks that she had um so we were in the bathroom you know said that girl think she just really really sad she didn't have that much to drink at all blah blah blah um and then nice student um was like okay let me just do some things just in case just to check if she okay and she said essentially that she was pretty unresponsive her eyes aren't dilating um so she was like let bring her to sit down so brought her to sat down and was like scared obviously 'cause didn't know what to do i've never been in this situation before um but yeah it was terrifying and she said get all your friends to take her to the er so scurried around the party looking for them and found them and said we have to take her to the er and they didn't know what was going on 'cause they couldn't hear me but just kept pulling them and pulling them until they got there said we have to go to the er um so we brought her to huhs and my big sib from abwha helped me and um this other nice lady that know um who sophomore think and it was helpful but we just sort of sat there and cried cried so much because was so scared for her was so sad for her she was so scared for her future in medical school and her parents how they would react when saw my friend my very best friend here um being so strong for her and just saying like it okay and sort of taking charge of just taking care of her and could feel when she was gonna break and heard her break um in the in the room at huhs um and couldn't go in there but wanted to be in there so badly to say that it was okay it was not her fault um but uh the girl who got drunk was really sad and upset that we brought her but um she really wasn't okay so that just something that i'm thinking about and i'm super stressed about um for the girl who sick but also for my friend that know is gonna take so much of this upon herself 'cause that what she does she just too good of person uh like just don't know like genuinely love her and i'm so scared for what she gonna do what she gonna do to herself with this situation 
222,i'm so so so tired can't even focus can't keep my eyes open can't track with my eyes couldn't write my paper i'm really sad and i'm really hurt by this guy hope things will get better don't know what the right decision is everyone telling me to get away from him but there something that pulling me back haven't slept enough i'd say for the past week and now it really getting me so need to sleep and um yeah just really tired miss my friends feel lonely but you know 
223,pretty long day today um last night just had to go to bed was feeling terrible but now i'm going to bed really really late um yeah not something wanna make habit of but i'm being productive like all day so don't really know what happening but either way it not gonna be habit tomorrow gonna be long day so have to wash my hair after class [inaudible] together and do homework but hopefully things will go well very grateful um for the day i've grown bit i've been really sad know i'm really sad um but like i'm interested in guy that i've been talking to for while after yesterday realized that um the guy that was like trying to pursue here um i'm just not his type so yeah that that i'm just feeling like when things happen they happen if they don't they don't but you know it is what it is at this point i'm just living life and waiting to see where things take me

225,okay day today pretty relaxed um went to the mall to buy clothes for friday which is yardfest um because i'd be going on stage and just wanna look like presentable having serious issue focusing um had to put my phone away from where i'm sitting so could focus which is really really bad and is new thing for me um compared to high school so that that also have to take shower um but yeah mean feel like my mondays and tuesdays are very busy and then the rest of the week can sort of chill but shouldn't chill you know what mean so need to figure that out and just make sure i'm productive and do work um yeah tomorrow another busy day but we will get things done for sure and also need to get sleep because it showing everywhere like my skin my face my health i'm just tired and now that i've gotten like seven hours of sleep for two nights i'm still super tired and you can really really tell in my face 
226,um today started fine um yeah it started okay went to class busy but that fine just starting to become stronger and get over things that have been bothering me and then of course talked to this guy today that been really like who essentially really hurt me and has no idea or so would like see how he is the one that has hurt me and how i'm just reacting um but yeah just hate him hate him so much and he just like my father and don't know what to do don't wanna be don't even know if wanna be friends with him anyway he not good for me he not healthy for me and for some reason still want him to want me and to like me at least and know he doesn't and i'm just waiting for him to say it but he keeps saying he does and know he lying and he you know he recently said he doesn't think he likes me in like that way anymore which hurt so much because was right he liked the idea of me but he didn't like who actually was think showed him too much of myself just why just keep everything everything everything to myself but um yeah essentially he exemplifies everything that thought guys would [inaudible] into my life would just pry you open help you release all of you know your pain your vulnerabilities and then they just leave you out to dry just walk away from you they don't put you back together nothing and hate him for that hate him hate him for that because he too self-centered he too conceited he thinks he too perfect to have ever made mistake or to have ever hurt anyone or been in the wrong makes me angry but he also makes me so sad was so so so so sad today walked to the bridge and just sat there and cried and listened to lauryn hill ex-factor and cried cried cried then these guys came in this car and first kinda saw them stop so was like leaning on the ledge but like got off of it so they wouldn't think was gonna do anything 'cause wasn't going to and then like like heard this line again that lauryn has that she was like um essentially it like thought you would be there for me like you said you'd be there for me cry you said you'd cry for me that you would die for me or whatever and it just really hurt because it was so true he said he would be there he not and he never will be he never could be 'cause he can't see me and it just like what the heck just can't believe fell for it it is annoying but can only go up from here and have to have faith that other people are are better but yeah so cried then they wanted to make sure was okay and was and said thank you and [inaudible] and then god bless them and stuff and they drove off and made sure they drove off and then decided that it'd be good idea to take off my headphones and go home so went home and i'm coming to bed and i'm gonna sleep 
228,i'm really tired got hit in the head with an elbow yesterday and i'm feeling not very well feeling like i'm concussed which i've had like five or six or so know these symptoms so i'm just gonna go to bed really struggling with focusing um had decent conversation with someone um who has called me his best friend um which is good guess we have um don't know if we've healed but we've stopped fighting and yeah i'm just tired and can't focus but also miss my friends it only been like day but know they're having fun and doing great things without me but that okay just wanna go to sleep let see yeah got waffle today which is good went to whole bunch of meetings about vietnam police brutality that happened last night and cried lot also as political action chair bsa felt like wasn't doing enough and also can't quite relate um because this was an international black student and if my job is to elevate the voices of others then i've gotta keep my mouth shut so yeah all of that has been on my mind i'm just so tired and my body hurts my cramps really really hurt just want to be loved really want to be in relationship but nobody wants that don't even know if people like me and that hard but i'm dealing with it as we must all yeah that my week feel like yeah that it 
229,super tired today really need to go to bed um spoke with um the guy that really don't like but have been good friends with for most of this year um kinda felt normal when he spoke about you know me and other guys which think is healthy thing for us we're just like at least separating which is great he has yet to tell me about the girl he talking to but know which is interesting um let see saw some of my friends today and and that was just like don't know what you do with him like we've been telling you this since day one da da da da and was just sitting there like yeah yeah you're right like um sorry not i'm sorry but like hear you like yes you're right then after that friend left my other friend was like you know that was really shitty of him to do that and it not okay for him to rub it in your face um and he can't really um expand on how obvious or how easy that decision was to make because he wasn't the one in the situation and um that is really shitty of him and not really good friend and didn't really think about it that way or noticed it until she said something um and so it really good to have her she really really great friend actually and like i've only known her for like two months now but she she real she really really real and really appreciate that um like her lot so i'm happy that i've made friends and that someone out of my friend group um so personally call her and yeah so things are things are going okay guess and growing and like that 
230,so definitely have concussion hmm definitely felt it till today it very unproductive barely did any work with departments for an an elections one because wanted to be there too as my position as political action chair wanted to be there to figure out who i'm working with um and really just get the inside scoop on who these people are what their shortcomings are how get about that um also realized that this guy that talk about way too much but um that has would say damaged me lot this year has been problematic who still call my friend am really so scared of him am and i'm so scared that wasn't willing to say anything about the meeting about him and i'm i'm glad didn't because the four-roles policy didn't work um at bmf the process is people get their speeches you have time for questions and then you exit the room and people deliberate and they discuss you know experiences you've had with them and then like why do you think they're good candidate or not good candidate blah blah blah and people really said like he homophobic he terrible person to work with um he horrible person for this position and then somebody else said for any position and it like realized that that do that and he was running for inclusivity chair and he somebody who has hard time respecting women and really other marginalized people that aren't like him and um wasn't able to stand up for him and say yeah he means well but also wasn't able to say like that accurate because was afraid that it would be shared and was right it did get shared and i'm glad didn't say anything again that like that really bad that i'm willing to hold my tongue out of fear for someone who my age and has no power over me or shouldn't have power over me so my friend also gave me some really good insight and she said you know if you're gonna let him think you're his best friend and really be his friend in all this then you're gonna have to do better because just leaving after he lost and not saying anything and like not being there and supporting him and saying he has good intention or has you know goodwill um while we were deliberating like you're not being good friend you're not being that best friend and was like don't want to you know what mean and like knew that wouldn't have done it for like the people that actually consider my friend and it made me realize that i'm staying cordial with this person because i'm afraid of them not because want to be their friend so that was really eye-opening 
231,today was really interesting um it was kind of peaceful other than me not getting to class on time actually no did make it on time but it was late for me like to be early to class um ended was really wild night um black men forum elections were yesterday um four walls policy during the deliberation process fell through and people have been saying things [inaudible] has been said um there has been lot of thing there have been lot of things going around about someone who was friends with um considered pretty close guy friend i've been friends with for most of this year um and he was homophobic terrible for the position someone said terrible for any position at all um exclusive essentially not woke lot of bad things um then spoke to him little bit about it the night after the election and the night of the election he was fine and then today get got text [inaudible] from that night saying where are you and then like don't know 30 seconds minutes later he in my room and he goes you know just don't understand and he starts getting upset and he gets kinda loud he like bangs on the door the wall little bit was like moving around my room very um expressive with his hands but in the beginning he was sort of like i'm so angry and he like lifted his fist and they were balled and it it was reaction to something that had said that he didn't really like um asked him to close my door and he slammed it and it was just like it was really bad situation it was very very similar to that um of which my parents used to have um my mom was abused emotionally and physically and i've been seeing lot of signs of my dad in this guy for quite some time um but this was think was the final straw came into my space unannounced he did knock on the door but like at that point you don't say no he was already in technically in my room he just wasn't in my single so that was terrifying um came in unannounced yelling didn't wanna listen to me didn't like any of the answers had to say it was just very very very very uncool um and my friend came over after spoke to couple of other friends over facetime mostly just one friend over facetime and they were essentially like we've been telling you that he not good for you and was like already knew that but it-it hard when that the first person that finds value in you that was the first male that had ever found that knew found value in me and thought was worth something and important so it was hard to let him go but after this event like was so triggered like my roommate knocked on my door and got so scared that started to tear up like i'm afraid i'm scared asked to my roommates to lock my doors um so yeah it it went from pretty relaxed taking it easy because of the concussion to very very stressful but i'm okay now i'm okay 
232,super tired again um need to get to sleep and get rest this morning woke up was okay did my hair little bit of self-care um so unproductive today it not even funny it like really bad so need to make sure get on top of that and do really well with that the silly thing that i'm really worrying about right now but i'm just so tired and need to be getting sleep because of this concussion but it like impossible also the doctor didn't give me note so that fantastic but think he'll hmm don't know i'm just like so tired um saw my friends today sitting with the guy that said wouldn't talk to anymore um he was he was talking to my one friend about he perc about how he perceived as homophobic and how that friend is um he is gay so that was that was good for them to have think but yeah i'm just so tired can't focus 
233,not bad day today um not even remembering what my day was like it super busy day thursday so lots of classes back to back then stuff for the iop but um yeah excited for tomorrow friend is coming excited to see him and yeah just seemed to get lot of work done need to wake up kind of early but i'm also concussing need to be getting sleep so shouldn't be up right now but am but i'm going to bed now and yeah have to do like whole bunch of last-minute things tomorrow and put my calendar up today and realized how much stuff have due and how much haven't done which is crazy um but it will get done and know it will so i'm excited and it will happen 
236,um not terrible day today did not do as much work as would have liked to do um which is super unfortunate 'cause have lot of work to do later on um said good-bye to friend today that had um hooked up with and like attempted to have sex with but didn't work um and that was sad because told him that like wasn't really interested in him in terms of having relationship and felt really bad saying it but like was not able to get aroused um at all by him and so like when we were doing things it kind of hurt and couldn't say anything because felt bad and that not something wanna do either um so like that happened spoke and hung out with an upperclassman um today my big sib which was good we connected um as much as we say you know like we're like the same person she really unhappy um and she really not confident in herself and that not something that wanna continue guess so been hearing that today was like okay need to change what i'm doing because as successful as she is don't wanna be as unhappy as she is so that was really interesting to see was super busy day just going from like meeting to meeting and then to the event and yeah so now i'm home we need to go to bed 'cause have to wake up early have not been getting sleep but yeah hmm definitely won't be able to go to party tomorrow so have to send text to cancel that as well but yeah that about it 
237,i'm super super tired today was really hard for me to get through because was so tired from getting essentially no sleep last night so really wanna catch up on that have two thing two big things due wednesday so need to get those done um yeah just have been thinking about how much like [redacted] someone there um as in significant other and don't know if want relationship or just hookup um but like feel like have needs and don't know what to do with them um i'm nervous about this summer 'cause i'm going to peru but that'll be fine and yeah i'm just so so so tired and getting through today was really hard because of that um like yeah also my friend is really struggling with what happened this weekend her ex visiting her um and it like for people that get close with sometimes feel like can feel their emotions just like can feel when they're stressed you know what mean that how my mom is with her brother and her couple close friends she has that she grew up with and considers family and sisters um and like feel that with her and like knew like since yesterday that she was not having good day um she sent me nice message saying that like she knew was worried but that she okay which would like to believe and don't completely but will give her her space and that hard just wanna be there for her and just like support her in way that she doesn't really let me but need to be okay with the way she operates so um think from this point on won't be asking that much i'll just leave her to tell me and try not to get upset when hear from other people that also something that happening was like i'm not jealous of her other friends just wish could be someone she could confide in comfortably as she does with so many other people but that okay yeah then uh i'm just ready to go to bed 
238,um today was not busy but did get little stressed when saw um someone that haven't been talking to for quite some time and or what feels like long time and it was hard to sit in the same room as him for an hour an hour and half and just act like we didn't know each other or anything or that we hadn't spent the whole semester and half spending lot of time together so that was something that really put damper on my mood for the rest of the day um and did homework with friends to try to get my mind off of that went to go for walk but stopped myself halfway and came back to campus and yeah just have i'm like really stressed about paper but have like other social issues think that are distracting me unfortunately but need to get this draft done by tomorrow so can go to this pre-punch and yeah hoping tomorrow can be super super productive 
239,um long day today really tired was supposed to go to pre-punch event tonight didn't go um just wrote an essay all day handed in the rough draft it it pretty rough know how to redo lot but we'll see where it goes feel really really fat so need to figure out what to do about that it something concerning me for some reason but yeah so gonna figure out lot of things but um yeah just really need to get studying and finish these papers and it gonna be real grind for the next couple of days and wanna make sure that stay on top of that hopefully that goes well that really all i'm thinking about now but today it was good did most of my homework with friends um and that was productive actually but um yeah little bit of challenge have some conversation with friends about getting with guys and sleeping with them and that was interesting because for while though was like yeah guess want that but and realized like think want something lot more intimate and um long-lasting guess so that was cool but yeah 
240,um pretty good day today not as productive as would have liked to be finally finished an econ chapter that was due probably weeks ago but you know it it it it got done somewhat to certain extent um also had formal tonight which stayed for about 50 minutes just to support the group that i'm part of that is performing and that was interesting i'm feeling very very like anti-social which is fantastic except don't do things um about it which is good which is not good and um yeah it was just like really interesting to see like all those people and had absolutely no interest in saying hi to single person um and yeah that like new for me um i'm super tired my body is telling me to sleep and keep pushing but that okay it not okay and yeah that about it it was pretty chill day the weather was nice so sat outside and pretended to do homework and that was good 
241,um today wasn't bad my friend slept over and spent lot of time with her today which was interesting um she'd mentioned to me that she the type of person that has one friend she really close to think i'm becoming that person don't know how feel because really do love being alone um and think i'm most productive there but also don't know how to say no and also don't want her to think that don't want to be her friend um so that something that i've been struggling with internally but haven't said anything about um and then today went to like movie screening with couple of people um and there were only like 10 to 15 people there the movie was awful um but sat there and everybody there was black and felt so left out like didn't know anyone knew some people but not upperclassmen and felt like when did say things they were just like what is she doing like what does she who is she you know and that hard it really hard um yeah and like all my friends are fine and close with them so that was unfortunate but um yeah and then one this was in the quad so on the shuttle back um one of the upperclassmen were with us and she started crying think something was happening with her um and was going back to the [yard] with one of my friends one of the closest friends have here and she sitting across from me and she [tends] text um that says think i'm gonna stay with um the upperclassman-person name um to see if she okay and started to type like okay yeah or like something longer and then all of sudden just deleted it all wrote which we know for each other is not really good sign um and thankfully seconds after sent that we'd arrived at the [yard] and you know said bye to the upperclassman you know tried to show my condolences and left bolted out and then look back and see that uh my friend and the other um girl that i'm close with uh both left and the upperclassman went home by herself um and just started walking really fast because there was so much adrenaline mean there was so much energy in me and was just like can't be here right now need to go for walk and couldn't really figure out what was going on and i'm still not quite sure what was going on but was so angry and it was like uh know need to cry and have needed to cry for long time but they won't come out and don't know what going on but wanted to cry so badly and went to the bridge and just looked at the water and like my eyes would water little bit but not enough it was just really frustrating and they started calling my name and they were like where are you going was like going for walk and just kept walking and then the girl i'm closest with texted me and said what wrong um said everything fine and then she sent text okay so you your emotions and your actions take 180 all of sudden and you're totally different and you walk away sure okay um so she was right was upset but didn't say anything and just don't know why i'm upset and this is something that has happened before where do get really really angry or sad and have no idea why but my body shows it and my heart shows it so need to figure that out asap but yeah that what been on my mind and stressing me along with homework and studying 
242,um pretty good day today actually it was reminiscing day today had meeting for [redacted] didn't do that well in it um but know what need to do to fix it which is pretty good it makes me feel comfortable um it was an amazing day in terms of weather so sat outside and just enjoyed it so much sat with friends don't usually sit with which was really cool um it was just fun like genuinely just like fun day fun experience and yeah and this guy that i'm interested in um came and sat down with me for while and just like we didn't talk really he just like sat he sat like sort of behind me next to me and just sort of like leaned back on him and then did his hair later on and did such bad job and knew was gonna do terrible job and tried to tell him and he was like no that fine um and was really really really embarrassed um and it was also like silent there which really reminds me of how awkward am and how little social skills have so that something that wanna work on but yeah so that really what was my biggest stress today other than like not being as productive as need to be when am doing work do feel like i'm making progress which is really good um really wanna get this [ex post] paper done yeah 'cause only have week left to do it but um yeah huh interesting let me get my calendar now really need to get cracking on my papers but yeah so wanna be more productive and but today was like pretty nice but it ended sort of crappy terrible parties and my closest friend here sort of seem like she was upset with me but think she was upset with something else um and yesterday like sort of left her abruptly off of the shuttle and just was like need to go off for walk and she texts me asking what was wrong and said nothing and she was like oh like you have this 180-degree turn in um just like emotions and like presence really and you're saying nothing wrong and essentially was like yeah i'm fine um and think today when she sort of did that to me it was like little bit of payback and so i'm like i'm not upset but [paid] for it 'cause get it 'cause ask her to share things with me and then don't share things with her um but there also this part um where feel like need to be more comfortable with her not sharing things with me um because i'm not the only person in the world who [inaudible] and think part of it is just that like genuinely care about her too but so just did but like not [good] you know so that something that think i'm gonna work on lot and think that will alleviate lot of the stresses that we have just because we're like so close and we genuinely care about each other so much so like it hard when we don't feel like what we're giving to each other is being reciprocated but um yeah and also the stresses today were just social things but at the end of the day would say it was an overall positive day 
243,today was really nice um relaxed did most of my all of my homework by myself spent most of the day by myself saw my dad hung out with him for bit which was good um but yeah kinda like being by myself so i'm gonna do that more often know it the end of the semester it not really the time to do that but that what feels right so that what i'm gonna do um yeah and things will happen the way they will [inaudible] coming out tomorrow night and the night after don't think i'll be going to both but i'm not quite sure yet um yeah got little stressed by one of my close friends today she kinda was rude to me yesterday but just let it go because know how she deals with emotions when she stressed don't think she meant it negatively but whatever um yeah then today didn't speak to her didn't see her at all um and she said she doesn't think she gonna go to the football anymore and she was my plus one so that that was exciting um didn't respond to that also messaged her friend after they messaged me and uh questioned photo that posted um because the girl that was on the photo i'm not really friends with but she in our blocking group people don't really like her and you know kinda found myself guess defending myself and saying that like no we're not friends just wanted to post the picture and then feel stupid and so told her sort of how really felt about like how our group is so factioned and are so easy to judge other people for hanging out with others but we don't even hang out together as whole we don't use the group chat anymore nobody reaches out to people me and one other person in the group feel super left out and ostracized all the time but was like we've done nothing wrong if anything we've been the most forgiving of the entire group so it like don't know maybe little worried about next semester when we're all actually living together but it is what it is we'll figure it out things will work out have faith it just really annoying 'cause don't wanna have these conversations at all 
244,um not terrible day today um sorry this is so late [inaudible] [inaudible] o'clock in the morning but um yeah today wasn't bad uh did work went to lunch saw some friends had discussion with one friend about the stresses he having over blocking group and how no one is reaching out to him then he stopped reaching out to others and that he sort of drifting away um spoke to one of my block mates also about how sort of felt left out and how like working on individual friendships within our group is important um that when people don't have any ties to strengthen um it really hard to stay happy and part of the group um there was also freshman formal that was tonight uh yeah i'm finding myself trying to impressive this guy that like but just like make sure he sees me that annoying and don't really like seeing myself do that so i'm gonna try to not do that anymore um but yeah i'm so tired so tired 
245,um today was pretty awful um struggled lot with friends block of group people ignoring our existence excuse me people in the group ignoring other people existence distancing themselves from specific people not being forward not reaching out has all materialized into this [sculpture] not [sculpture] excuse me into this don't know this jungle gym obstacles um and it very very frustrating because feel like did nothing wrong but also can't ask um i'm supposed to be having meeting with one of my friends tomorrow and yeah so actually all these relationships are breaking apart and we're supposed to go together next semester it so gonna be so so so rough but yeah that really that all in my mind right now 
246,pretty rough day today um lot of social stresses just with [inaudible] group um lots and lots and lots of tension there not much can do about it essentially i'm am being selfish and just getting bothered by the fact that my friends don't really speak to me when they're having issues um and yeah so that that is me being selfish need to fix that but also wish i'd said more in the conversation about this being two-way street it is tough but don't know at the end of the day they needed to be [inaudible] start talking to them think for thi the rest of the semester and like not because i'm mad at them or anything just because like i'm tired of focusing on that and don't want to so i'm not going to anymore uh yeah so that that and that always gonna be now well we'll take it from there next semester 
247,today wasn't terrible sat outside hung out with friend friend that don't usually hang out with which was cool um you know got over whatever going on with my blocking group which is good um so yeah so that was well things are little rocky with guy was really interested in and really liked um but my friend sort of reassured me that this probably isn't uh i'm not interested it more of this isn't the right time which guess is positive but still disappointing um and then yeah my mom graduating tomorrow should be in bed have to wake up early um so i'm really happy for her and excited for her just wanna be there for her so hopefully that goes well and yeah i'm just living not being as productive as need to be for sure oh no way um and it gonna bite me in the buttock but we're getting there i'm also really really not liking my body right now i'm super out of shape but yeah 
248,today it was really great got to see my mom graduate from graduate school at northeastern and that was awesome hung out with her and my dad and some close family friends which was really exciting um i'm just very very proud of her and this is like new point in our relationship think we're like i'm proud of her as fellow adult and not just as like mom child sort of thing um but like really do admire her and think she pushes me along in this um sort of inspired me to like get back on the grind and like realize that i'm student too and that need to go places and do things so that was really good for me um didn't speak to that many friends today other than people saying congratulations um in response to my snapchat story or instagram story or whatnot but we went to dinner um sat there at the graduation it was only like total of like four or five of us so it was very small group um and yeah felt fine now feel like i'm gonna vomit so going to sleep is gonna be hard but wanted to finish that essay and have to wake up early tomorrow but since the essay is not finished i'll be waking up earlier tomorrow to do it to like ni 1030 meeting so we'll see what happens mean yeah don't know i'm just like disappointed that it not done with but know it'll be okay

258,um today was busy long did my hair which took forever and then went to meeting in boston and um then met friend after and did little walking in boston but um spoke to my mom and she was like thought you would work out every day and um kinda caught me off guard she caught me off guard couple of times with comments like that so working out tomorrow morning gonna go very hard got my hair done and my eyebrows done spoke to friend today about this guy that i'm still thinking about that is not thinking of me and she was just like he going about his life living the summer why aren't you doing the same that kinda hit me hard so i'll be living this summer as myself um and we'll be making sure that it is the best summer and that produce incredible work and do great things and avoid getting in trouble at home and abroad um yeah so we'll see what happens we'll see what happens 
259,today kinda felt long and short woke up at 700 dropped my mom off at work went to the gym showered and got ready went to the salon went to see movie with my friend and then came back home went to the lake went to the [redacted] and then got back home i'm very tired around the middle of the day got really like sick something like cold so i'm just chilling [inaudible] right now um my period think is taking toll on me am becoming more and more antisocial just want to be alone want to be by myself just want to rest uh but feel like that getting harder and harder to do stressed about working out because need to lose weight putting pressure on myself and from my mom but also just paid money to get my hair done so don't wanna ruin that it also the wrap have on right now is so tight that it giving me headache um other things yeah friend told me some interesting information today it was hard to hear but i'm glad she was able to share that with me and felt comfortable doing that um yeah and i'm just like really ready for bed we'll see what happens tomorrow 
260,today was very chill day dropped my mom off at work then went um back home to get ready and basically went on walk for about three or four hours um on the east side which is nice part of rhode island and that was relaxing picked up some things um listened to my mom talk lot about me losing weight working on myself [inaudible] within myself being confident of myself eating right heard lot of uh lectures about eating and decisions and thought processes in regards to those things and that gotten little frustrating but i'm working on dealing with it um yeah am starting to realize that like don't wanna be around any people at all like want to be by myself want to be alone and just wanna sleep as well um so that been very interesting experience 'cause always defined myself as people person but don't want to see or talk to anyone want to be by myself and that it which is don't know what the purpose of that is don't know why that happening um but we'll see yeah 
261,um today was okay was by myself for most of the day which was nice worked out went for walk wasn't very productive i'm worried about the internship that have coming up don't even know what questions to ask but really need to sit down and think and do it um so that may be something that do on the train tomorrow also worried about my internship in peru haven't heard anything from them um which is quite frustrating and am i'm little nervous about it but of course my parents are even more nervous about it um which is unfortunate but i'm hoping to hear from them soon yeah those are really the only two things that i've been thinking about um so we'll see what happens with that yeah my mom has been really really really pushing me eating healthy eating less we're always having food talks always always always always talking about food and how to eat less and how bad it is for you and this and that it like it gets annoying and think she doesn't even want me to take photos of food she doesn't want me to use like words that are food like say like would use chimichanga as like filler when don't know how to finish my sentence or whatever she was like you should stop doing that people are gonna get the wrong idea about you which i'm assuming is that like to eat which is true but um whatever guess that'll change know it that she means it in the best way but it like it it annoying and it not that she shaming me but don't like it and don't really appreciate it and don't think that driving me away from eating um is the same as instilling fear of food and like complete like diet essentially from food and when say diet mean like not talking about food not taking pictures of food not like like none of that like don't think that good thing think it creates this fear it sort of breeds this this hypersensitivity to food and how bad it can be for you when at the end of the day you need it you know what mean but know she means well 
262,pretty okay day um fell asleep for sec which is why this is kind of late um yeah went to austin did stuff for my trip to peru just prepared for that with immunizations and forms um so yeah then just hung out with my dad which was frustrating at times 'cause don't really get or really enjoy his sense of humor and um sometimes things can get really frustrating with him but things went well until the last minute where got frustrated after he left which was weird but was really bothered by it um yeah then was just very horny so masturbated was pretty okay um yeah feeling sickly and cough coming so trying to get rid of that with tea it not really working but yeah hopefully tomorrow we're protective did what wanted to do today for one of my internships so that was good to get out of the way but yeah 
263,um today was pretty relaxed had um had conversation with my mom woke up to messages um as in text messages as well as instagram messages about weight loss losing the freshman 15 um those all came from my mom which was you know not exactly what wanted to wake up to but know she means well after that we went for walk um we got back and went to the gym and uh yeah then we relaxed um ate dinner went to get things and then came back and continued uh unpacking from college um i'm leaving in two weeks so it kind of weird to unpack to know that i'll have to pack again in about week and half um but i'm letting things happen am feeling better about my body and that i'm working out more um and i'm little stressed about how i'm going to keep up throughout the year [inaudible] like if have time to be in relationship as wanted to for so long um but i'm just like putting lot of faith in god and i'm also trying to make sure that stay or become more religious this year um and so figuring out how to do that and you know wanting to do it for myself um as well as for those around me you know just to be well versed in it when need it but also maybe when friends need it and just to you know feel confident in in something you know what mean to say that adamantly believe in something and i've no question about that is something that wanna be able to say so i'm looking forward to that next year i'm really just thinking about next year looking forward to it and i've also been struggling with what want as career as much as wanna have social impact and through policy and things like that also don't wanna be living in box and that means may have to go towards consulting um who really knows but we'll see 
264,today was interesting woke up was kind of on the go was supposed to meet my dad for movie up in boston live in rhode island so it an hour hour and half um traveled to watch movie with him to see deadpool um wake woke up was rushed as usual for things like that um and saw friend from high school at starbucks on the way had really nice conversation with her and caught up um so we're planning to catch up some more am let see then we ended up getting to boston um things were tense between my parents which is something um normal and uh they just got toge progressively got worse um now my dad is little weird with me but think he just upset with the situation and not me so i'm not really gonna take any of it to heart um which is growth for me which is good um let see the movie was fine really was kind of unbothered by the situation between my parents because it just normal that like what i'm used to um it almost bothers me when they do get along because feel like it fake um let see yeah mean sort of had this lingering feeling over my head that like i'm doing lot of things wrong and don't know and that my mom was gonna explode at me pretty soon but don't know what i'm doing wrong so i'm not sure what to stop but just feel it happening soon and that makes me nervous and 'cause in two weeks i'm leaving for peru that gonna be very stressful she probably gonna be mad that didn't do things that don't even know um earlier and she also gonna be sad that i'm leaving it'll be easier for me to leave if she mad at me it'll be easier for her to let go so don't know but yeah that really all that happened today yeah

270,pretty long day today went to bed really late last night woke up early to go to the gym and then hang out with my mom all day that was fun that was nice hit some bumps but did pretty well ate pretty healthily today i'm realizing that there are points in the day where i'm just like tired and done with socializing um and just kind of like clock out and turn off and shut down so that not great but hopefully that gets better i'm so nervous for peru um which is happening in week like don't want to go uh yeah so that really terrifying but hopefully that gets better uh yeah that really all that on my mind just getting ready 
271,and today was kind of hard um and not sleeping well at all so that really difficult for me um also didn't work out today so got really frustrated um which has been happening lot was just like all of sudden be in mood and have no tolerance for people who don't wanna talk to people don't wanna hear people don't even wanna be in the same room as other people um that pretty bad and i'm not sure what causing that think i've really been looking towards alone time and sometimes just really really need it and when can't get it get frustrated but i'm not quite sure what the root of those mood swings are and i'm not on my period either but that has definitely been happening lot while home not sleeping well while home um not being very productive while home it very interesting but have been working lot on my self-image self-confidence and things like that i'm really nervous for this trip in peru that may be why i'm not sleeping um but i'm also looking forward to it so i'll see what happens think just have to be lot more positive about my future and really get my goals in line and then things will happen the way they need to from there i'm just trusting god uh so yeah that really all that been on my mind today just being incredibly frustrated with people and then looking forward to peru
