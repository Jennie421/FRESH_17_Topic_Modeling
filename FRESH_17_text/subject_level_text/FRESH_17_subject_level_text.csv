3KS75,today felt good when first woke up had pretty normal day had few things wanted to get done um getting closer to this evening felt more stressed out and anxious as my roommate decided to have her boyfriend over without really telling me in advance and then found out that he would be staying over the night as well which didn't really have an advance notice on causing me to be stressed out and feel uncomfortable staying in my room so felt like needed to go somewhere else so isolated myself and tried watching movies but that got my roommate to be frustrated at me because wasn't interacting with everyone else so just removed myself from the room and went off to read and reached out to my family back home for help and my mom was little bit helpful but she also just stressed me out more because she wanted me to reach out to people that i'm not really close with in the end did end up reaching out to another friend and hung out with her which really did make me feel lot better but still feel anxious about going back inside since my roommate and weren't really getting along earlier and now she thinks that i'm upset with her and i'm not really sure what happened with her boyfriend but i'm gonna go back in and figure it out and in the future think i'll reach out to [redacted] and start talking to someone so don't feel stressed out and out of place and can feel more comfortable in my own space in my room today felt pretty lonely my roommate went back home and is staying home overnight so spent the majority of my day in my dorm room and spoke with my mom on the phone for bit but it really just stressed me out 'cause she was just complaining about our family back home and went shopping but the store was closed so couldn't get my school supplies which made me more anxious because have lot of stuff need to do for my [redacted] class coming up and can't do it until buy the supplies that need um and then i'm more stressed out because i'm shopping two new classes this week so i'm gonna have to figure out whatever missed from the last week and lot of people in my entryway were hanging out today but didn't go with them and isolated myself which was not the best plan but have hard time interacting with people especially without having friend already there so isolated myself but i'm gonna work on it and made an appointment with huhs to go and talk to someone so hopefully that will help today generally felt little bit better went to new class that was super interesting um went to new club that had good time at spent the majority of my day with my friends and my roommate and we did have little bit of trouble but not too bad and talked um for while with my family back home and it was pretty good overall and friend from back home also called me and it was really nice talking to her for the little bit of time and other than that was little bit stressed about the classes and having some stuff to do tomorrow just because of having to buy textbooks and being unsure of like how much wanted to spend but will be going to work later in the week and training for second job which will definitely help out the financial uneasiness and tomorrow i'll try out one more new class and hopefully my schedule will be set and that will help me to have little bit of stress relief because i'll definitely have set routine going into the week next week today was pretty good day overall had bunch of classes so got pretty busy with homework and stuff but managed to get all the assignments done that needed to get done i'm little bit behind on the reading but that just because i'm starting two new classes and still have to wait for my textbooks to come in so hopefully can get caught up tomorrow have pretty busy schedule but talked it out with some friends and it should go all right and i'm training for another job so hopefully that will help me to be less stressed about my financial situation um we had meeting with my entryway today but it was really crowded and hot so didn't stay for long i'm still glad that went because got to talk to few other people in my [inaudible] and got to hang out with my roommate and good friend from upstairs so overall it was pretty good day and may not get too much sleep tonight because still have quite bit of work to do and catch up on but i'm looking forward to the weekend when can have time to go back over everything and really prepare and hopefully get caught up in the classes that just started today was really good day wish i'd gotten little bit more sleep but after woke up super early got ready for class and had little bit of time to relax and put out some things before had to go to class and class was super interesting and i'm really excited because my book arrived so get to pick it up tomorrow and then i'll get to start reading and catch up on some of the work have been behind on and taking notes [inaudible] interesting have quite few assignments going into next week but my saturday and sunday looks pretty clear just have to pick up some shifts at work which i'll probably have time for tomorrow evening and and saturday evening so that should help and also just got trained for my second job today which was really easy and fun and should start that job either this week or next week which will be nice to get paid little bit more than usual by doing [a supplement] job and math is sort of stressing me out but think i'll get assigned to workshop which will definitely help because then i'll have someone that can help me with homework and things and make it go little easier also had my first day of lab today for my science course and it was really fun and just have to do lot for that but have friend that can work on it with which should make it easier so overall it was pretty good day today started out fairly well didn't really get enough sleep last night but still felt okay this morning just little bit sore classes were really fun and interesting and felt like really understood the work and had good time working with some classmates as well that helped make it little bit easier also went and worked with dorm crew for about two and half hours which was fun just having something to do that really felt productive and had time to relax in my room didn't really eat enough in the morning which didn't realize until later but then did eat and felt little bit better and towards the end of the evening started getting upset 'cause was just thinking about my cousin who passed away last year and my roommate really wanted to hang out with people but didn't want to but we did it anyway and just sort of got upset and she sort of made scene in front of other people so felt more awkward and so spent the rest of the evening alone in my room and they could kind of tell that was upset but didn't really feel like talking about it but tomorrow we're supposed to get some stuff in the mail and we're gonna go shopping so hopefully i'll feel little bit better then today was overall pretty good day got to sleep in little bit later and and then got the futon delivered to my dorm and so my roommate and opened it together and sort of spent the whole day relaxing got few of my text books in but decided to focus on homework tomorrow and try and get caught up on the week tomorrow and just spend time today relaxing with my roommate and friend of mine and my friend got into the band which was really awesome and we all went and had lunch together which was nice got to have ice cream and then my family from back home sent me surprise and so got that which was exciting and we basically spent the whole day relaxing in our dorm and sort of planning for the rest of the week we might go shopping for little bit tomorrow but also have to do all of my school work and then later this evening we hung out with people from our entryway and watched movie and made plans for sort of weekly movie night which will be really nice because it really good time to connect with other people and have sort of relaxed atmosphere so overall the week looking like it will go pretty well today overall went fairly well slept in really late which was nice and relaxing but also had lot of homework to get done and so sort of counterproductive ended up staying way too up way too late working on some of my stuff for class because was really stressed out and had hard time focusing on some of the things needed to get done had quite few assignments and projects due this week and definitely feel like i'm little bit behind but feel like it'll get better when actually go to class also have job training tomorrow so i'll be working shift so it looking like busy day and i'll be starting to set up some appointments to talk to counselor which would help and also need to call huhs to see about going to chiropractor because it hard to work on homework for extended periods of time because my back will get sore really easily so think definitely setting that stuff up for this week will help today was an okay day stayed up little bit too late last night trying to get some homework done 'cause ended up overthinking problem and confusing myself and having to spend longer time trying to figure it out because it was due today so still managed to get up on time and managed to get to class on time but think i'm gonna try and have set time to wake up every morning to keep into more of sleep schedule my other classes went okay and my other high points of the day i'm probably getting my homework back because did well on it um talking to some new people in chemistry class and um working my first shift on my second job it was lot of hard work but sometimes just being able to do something that like manual labor is very helpful it makes you feel productive and it also sort of wears me out so feel little calmer and more relaxed whenever went back to my dorm room also got to stop by brain break and get some hot chocolate and snack which was really lovely and tomorrow only have one class so should have plenty of time to get my homework done for the next day and to work on some assignments that are due by the end of the week today was feeling pretty under the weather but still managed to get up and go to class felt pretty bad 'cause was kind of falling asleep during class so felt bad for my professor but still en managed to take some good notes and still get bit out of the class so it still good that went and then went back home and worked for few hours which was nice and then managed to get lot of homework done and went to dinner with some friends which was good 'cause haven't been making it to [redacted] on time to eat um and after that we went back to the dorm and took nap 'cause was still feeling pretty under the weather but think i'll feel better tomorrow i've gotten quite few assignments done and should finish up another one tonight so i'll have little bit less to do because picked up quite few shifts at work for thursday so my thursday will be pretty busy other than that i'm just little stressed out because both my classes sectioned me for the same time so i'm gonna have to resection but will write them an email and in the end it should work out today was all right stayed up little bit too late with my roommate and friend because they didn't wanna go to bed and really should have gone to sleep because had lot of classes today and lot of homework that due 'cause i'm trying to get stuff done in advance so can work some shifts tomorrow so really stayed up too late and was kind of falling asleep in class went by to try to get help with my homework but couldn't find my tf so [inaudible] instead and hopefully i'll hear back 'cause that'll make me feel little bit better about an assignment that gonna be due on friday i'm little stressed because i'm gonna have an exam next week that don't really feel like i'm ready for but since it most of the weekend should have plenty of time to do practice problems and think we're gonna get practice test as well in class to take home so hopefully i'll have time to prepare for the exam my roommate going through really hard time with her boyfriend which is difficult for me as well because she needs some extra support right now but i'm really too busy to be exactly there all the time um she wanted me to stay up again with her tonight so plan on staying little bit later than wanted to because really need to go to bed 'cause have an early class and was falling asleep in class the other day so think i'll just stay up with her for bit work on some more of my stuff while am and then wake up early to get coffee to try to make it through tomorrow and do have an appointment tomorrow with the counselor and meeting with my adviser in the morning so hopefully it'll all go okay because i'll get some support and maybe some other advice on what need to do today was pretty stressful day woke up sort of late rescheduled meeting with my academic advisor because was too tired to go to it went to class um had few other things had to get done and then had to go to work which was stressful got caught in the rain couldn't finish my shift because it was late and couldn't get into the buildings so ended up getting back late to try and start my homework so i'm still up doing homework and my roommate having really rough time so she left to go to talk to someone and we kind of had little bit of an argument so i'm not really sure what to do and i'm not really sure if i'll get my work done 100 like wanted it to be because have class pretty early and just found out that i'll have another extra class have to go to tomorrow which will be interesting so hopefully can get it all done in time and get it turned in and and over the weekend should be less stressed because won't have work and i'll have time to prepare for next week and maybe get caught up and hopefully things with the roommate will work out better in positive was that went to counselling today so that was nice and really think that it'll start helping after start going regularly today overall was not the best day didn't get any sleep last night had to get up early for classes classes went fine but feel unprepared for my test that next week i'm just actually gonna have some trouble with the homework that was due this evening um went to work had some trouble with that had to work with some delivery guys and they weren't very happy and wanted me to call my boss and stuff so it was pretty stressful but in the end we got everything delivered it just took lot longer than it was supposed to um then went back to my dorm and tried to finish the assignment that had been struggling with and then heard from my mom who told me that my grandmother is in the hospital and it it not really anything her heart rate was just high so she fine but it just made me think of my cousin and the assignment was working on was over someone death which made me think of my cousin more so overall it wasn't the best evening but sort of reached out to friend that haven't spoken to in while and he was there for me and my older sisters were which made it better and i'll get to sleep in tomorrow and meet up with some friends and go out to dinner and picked up an extra shift at work so it shouldn't be too bad and then should have plenty of time to study this weekend and get some homework done today did not go very well woke up pretty late and didn't really get much done because i've been pretty upset about my grandmother being in the hospital and my roommate and my friend didn't understand that and stuff that was mad at them and even after explained they were very sympathetic and just sort of wanted to do their own thing um and tried to go out with them tonight after got off from work because really felt better after working for two hours and like sort of exhausting myself and so we went to sort of party but they just didn't wanna keep doing it and sort of forced me along with what they wanted to do um which is fine but also not what had in mind and sort of like talked over me so can't really talk to other people because they manipulated the situation which sounds bad to say but that what it seems like they were doing so overall i'm like pretty upset and i'm pretty stressed out because have [inaudible] exam this week and i'm really not prepared and really didn't get any of my homework done because i've been upset about the stuff going on at home and the stuff with my roommate so ended up leaving [inaudible] ended up going to movie too because they wanted to see some guys they liked so they [inaudible] with them but didn't wanna do it so ended up leaving and talking to my mom and my sister for while and then deciding to go to urgent health services which don't know what exactly i'm gonna tell them but at least something will help just don't wanna keep getting upset and crying and it hard because feel like can't be in my own room since have roommate but i'll talk to people at health services and see how it goes so hopefully it'll end up getting better today overall went really well woke up pretty late and [inaudible] 'cause had trouble sleeping last night but was able to spend the day relaxing still got to watch movie with friends and we ordered some pizza and had some other snacks needed to run to the store to get few things needed lot of school supplies and then was able to work on my homework for while 'cause had kind of lot but it fairly easy to understand and was able to get help on the stuff that didn't understand and so hopefully i'll get all that done not too late and still have little bit of time to relax um also felt lot better today because heard that my grandmother was able to go home from the hospital so that was good and talked to lot of my family members back home and my older sisters who are also off at school and we talked about all going home for thanksgiving which would be nice um other than that i'm pretty sore from work um because haven't been able to see chiropractor but hopefully will have time this week some time to schedule to be able to go and then i'll definitely feel better after that and think it could be next weekend uh some of my friends and are gonna go shopping for winter clothes because hopefully it will be getting colder soon and other than that the only thing i'm really worried about is the test that have on wednesday but should have enough time to prepare for it between tomorrow and tuesday so we'll see how it goes today was really easy didn't get too much sleep last night but still was awake enough to participate in class and do pretty well um so just went to my classes and got my work done and had time to start on some homework that due later in the week and had little bit of time to study for my test on wednesday and plan to study for while tomorrow in preparation for that same test um had meeting with my professor about math which felt was really helpful to making sure that i'm preparing well for the upcoming assignments and for the algebra gateway retake so that went really well um finally got around to getting some of my reading done [just] for for my other classes and should be getting that back [with] some grades later in the week which should give me better idea about my standing and how well i'm doing in my classes so far have few other assignments that are also gonna be due this week but hopefully after the test on wednesday i'll have plenty of time to work on them um do have two work shifts that i'm not too excited about but i'll get them done and they'll probably take like two hours each so won't be too bad and one will be good amount of money and other than that need to set up meeting with my academic advisor and really need to set up meeting with huhs to see about going to chiropractor so we'll see how the week goes today woke up late so thought about skipping class but in the end got ready and went but it was worth it because needed to take notes of the material to be prepared fully during the week um after class had to sneak off to my room and started doing some homework um and was really was really bit worried about test that have tomorrow because haven't really had time to study for it over the weekend sort of lot of drama [inaudible] so really didn't get much studying done and then yesterday had some other stuff that had to do so couldn't study for it then and then today tried to study for it in all of my free time but got lot of information from the people back home which took bigger portion of my day and had to leave to do few other things for some different classes and there was also some more drama with my roommate and it was her sort of interrupting while i'm trying to study and things like that that make it more difficult for me to focus and actually get it done so feel pretty unprepared for the exam but i'm just gonna go to bed and try and get good night sleep and do the best that can on the exam tomorrow it is the first exam so should be able to do better later in the semester or try and make up for it if don't do so well tomorrow um and maybe next time i'll take more time [inaudible] the office hours or do do the exam prep sessions so we'll just have to see in the end how it goes so the rest of the week is looking pretty busy as well today overall has been all right woke up little bit late so didn't have as much time to get ready for my exam as wanted um the exam overall went okay but do wish had studied little bit more because there was one problem specifically that hadn't had time to look over so i'm pretty sure didn't do it correctly um but guess we'll just see how it goes and it is only the first test so hopefully it will still work out okay um managed to get quite bit of my homework done because have long work shift tomorrow so wanted to make sure finished it [inaudible] so i've spent the majority of my day doing homework and it was pretty nice because now feel lot less stressed about tomorrow um also managed to actually go to the dining hall for lunch and dinner so made sure to eat good meal and i've had time to hang out with my friends as well um probably gonna stay up little bit later to watch show together but it shouldn't be too bad 'cause can sleep in little bit later 'cause don't have class right away in the morning um so i'll see how it goes i'm also going to see my counsellor tomorrow so that should hopefully help me feel better about some things going into this weekend because still have quite few responsibilities so and heard little bit from people back home today but not as much as would have liked to they're still being really supportive and my sister will be flying up here in like 10 days so i'll get to see her and spend some time with her which should help quite bit so today was definitely busy day um woke up on time to get ready and go to class but was little frustrated um just because of how my roommate woke me up um class went just fine and had section and everything that went well got good grade back so was pretty happy about that um was little bit frustrated um just because won't know about some other grades until tomorrow and i'm really worried about them and then was so stressed out that ended up missing doctor appointment that had so had to reschedule it for next week and had really long work shift that ended up working from 630 to 1130 and coming back finishing my homework then just staying up for bit to shower and unwind so i'm going to be pretty late but don't have too many classes tomorrow just have lot of appointments and things that have to get done tomorrow and saturday but i'm planning also for downtime to relax on saturday as well going to game with my friends um and today was good because talked to some new people and went to dinner with new friend so sort of changed my routine which was nice to have some different people to talk to um probably also need to clean bunch this weekend because our room is pretty messy but we'll see how it goes today went fairly well was little bit stressed out about test that didn't do as well as i'd like to on but also got another assignment back from another class that scored much better on than thought would which sort of brightened my day and had meeting with my academic adviser and he really helped me to see that the one bad test grade doesn't really matter that much because can make it up and it wasn't even that bad it was just that felt poorly about it um also had meeting to go check in for [inaudible] and that went really well and then had meeting with [inaudible] so not chiropractor so she gave me some tips and then referred me to physical therapy but won't be able to go until like the 16th so might try and get another appointment with an actual chiropractor for sooner than that um i'm pretty sore don't feel too well because i've had too many work shifts which i'm gonna have to do two work shifts tomorrow morning um and also wanna go to the game with some friends so we'll see how that goes because have to get everything done between 800 and before 1200 since the game at 1200 and so guess if don't finish my work in time i'll just have to go to the game late so i'll be getting up pretty early but tonight i'll be relaxing with friends and we got some food to eat so it should be really nice today was okay woke up and had an early shift with work um wasn't feeling too well 'cause fell on some stairs the other day so my other job they let me just take this week off um sent message to my healthcare provider to see about going to see chiropractor so can hopefully get that taken care of so that it will be easier to walk around and make it to classes all week long have quite few assignments over the weekend but really didn't get any of them done today spent part of the day working and spent part of the day at the game and then spent the rest of the day pretty much cleaning our room and then going to the birthday party of friend which was all right but pretty stressful just 'cause it was very social environment and my roommate and aren't exactly getting along um so she does some stuff that makes me feel really anxious and out of place which made it worse but for bit was separated and got to talk to few other people in my [entryway] which was nice and then left early to come back to my room and have some alone time to sort of destress tomorrow i'm planning on getting up early and just focusing on homework for while but i'm really looking forward to this weekend 'cause my sister will be coming and so hopefully it'll be better today slept in late and spent most of the day by myself my roommate wanted to go do few things but really just felt like being alone um didn't really feel like doing much work so just worked on art for while to help myself relax [finished] some some assignments um and then toward the end of the evening actually did my work and got quite bit of it done was able to concentrate so well because spent most the day alone didn't have any other distractions in the room with me my week is looking pretty busy um tomorrow in particular my [inaudible] full and have an upcoming exam thursday night but feel like i'm pretty well prepared for it uh i'll but i'll have to drop shift at work in order to be able to take it so hopefully my manager gets back to me about that sometime soon because i'll need to know um other than that i'm really looking forward to this weekend because my sister is coming to visit but i'm not looking forward to friday 'cause have major assignment due and i'm still really not sure how to start it so i'll probably get that started tuesday evening and just see how it goes from there have few other assignments due this week but nothing as major as the one that due friday so we are trying to [inaudible] that one my priority and hopefully the other assignments won't take me too long today woke up on time and made it to all of my classes which were pretty much just what expected um kind of [have] lot of assignments due this week but i've been keeping up with it okay today didn't really get much done because have so many classes that it makes me really not feel like doing any work even had to start another class today was the first meeting that lasted an hour and it give me two more hours of work outside of class which means i'll be pretty busy have work friday night and saturday morning and i'm planning on working tomorrow for my other job have test on thursday but feel like i'm pretty ready for it um today was nice 'cause went to lunch with some different people from my entryway that don't normally hang out with um it went fine and then had class and friend from the that class that went to and made plans to go and get lunch together on wednesday so it'll be someone else to hang out with as well and went to counseling today which was really nice i'm going back again on thursday so hopefully that'll help and was really glad 'cause got to talk on the phone with someone from back home for while so we'll see how everything goes this morning woke up on time to even go get breakfast [before] class so it started out better than it usually does um my day was fairly busy almost forgot had an evening class but then remembered and still managed to make it on time was little bit out of it and i've just sort of been depressed so really wasn't able to do my homework and my roommate kind of made that worse and complained about me not spending time with them so instead of doing my homework decided to spend time with my roommate which resulted in me not finishing my homework until 300 in the morning and going to bed late because have an 800 am class so [inaudible] right now and know that i'm gonna have to work really hard tomorrow to make up for it since i've quite few assignments due this week and still have test um thursday evening that i'm not really ready for but think think it should still be all right even if don't study as much as wanted to managed to work some today which was really nice and thursday have an appointment with my counselor which should be good and my sister coming this weekend so hopefully the week will start looking up just need to actually go to bed on time so we'll see today was difficult ended up waking up almost late for my class um but still managed to get there on time and class went alright thought about skipping one 'cause was really tired but went anyway and then later came back and napped and then managed to get to my other class in time and then spent the after the afternoon by myself which was nice but at the same time feel like i've sorta gotten more down and haven't been focused on [inaudible] really fully doing my homework or pay attention in classes which is bad because this week is pretty busy but think [inaudible] helping [inaudible] with my roommate [inaudible] making it worse because when [inaudible] it makes me not wanna do my work and they constantly want to do other things like watch tv when really need to be concentrating it makes it hard for me to focus um i'm going to counseling tomorrow so that should help but i'm just [inaudible] really anxious and depressed so we'll see i'm really hoping that my sister coming this week it'll help and talked to my grandmother on the phone today for bit which was nice but then was super more stressed from home from my mom with some trouble that been going on with my dad and my brother so overall i'm pretty stressed out and i'm thinking about going to bed without finishing my work and was trying to get it done tomorrow before have to go to class so i'm gonna see how it goes and hopefully can go to bed sometime soon 'cause my roommate currently in there watching show so we'll see how long it takes before i'm able to go to sleep today was all right um didn't really get enough sleep again so was kinda falling asleep in class but it turned out okay and was happy because got like good grade on paper um got lot of stuff due uh tomorrow which is why stayed up so late tonight and didn't even finish it all and so i'm just gonna email one of my tfs and the other one is not due until 900 pm tomorrow so hopefully i'll find some time to finish it i'm worried about getting up on time for classes but know that can probably drag myself there on time so it should be okay overall um [inaudible] this evening which didn't go as well as wanted it to but definitely better than the last one um just have to get through tomorrow and then i'll have the weekend so should be able to relax little bit and have doctor appointment about going to see chiropractor so [inaudible] definitely help me with my overall stress and should [hem] me help me start feeling lot better uh physically as well as mentally so we'll see how it goes this morning woke up and didn't feel too well so went back to sleep and ended up sleeping through all of my classes um which was unfortunate but went to the doctor and got note so it should work out just fine where can get grades and things missed excused and also have friends in all of the classes that can give me the notes that missed and things like that um did spend the day doing some homework and then had actual work later in the evening so still felt pretty productive after went to the doctor and got referral to an actual chiropractor so hopefully can go sometime next week because called this evening but they didn't call me back um we'll see and have pre-midterm next week which i'm little bit worried for but there study session that can go to with some friends so should just be able to do that to prepare for it and other than that don't really have any major assignments that are due so should turn out just fine today had shift of work so woke up pretty early um it was kinda difficult because it was raining and there were quite few people out in the yard still um but managed to make it through uh after that basically spent the day cleaning up my room and trying to get some stuff organized and taking shower um and then later my sister came in and we went to concert together which was really nice but i'm still having some issues with my roommate don't know she just been acting weird and i'm really stressed about school stuff so don't wanna deal with [personal] issues but still managed to relax at the concert 'cause had really awesome time it really made me feel great and tomorrow i'm gonna get up early know have lot of work to do so already have plans to work with some entryway mates and to go shopping with another friend so hopefully can get quite few things done and then be ready for the week which is gonna be pretty busy have quiz on monday and test on tuesday so we'll see how everything goes today overall didn't go too well um woke up pretty late and spent the whole day trying to do homework but really couldn't focus and get any of it done and ended up getting some news from home that made me pretty upset so was just trying to avoid being upset um cleaned few things up tried to relax little bit but i'm really behind on my school work so had to email some of my tfs and try to [inaudible] few friends and in the end went to go and talk to my proctor about some stuff that been going on lately and they said that they were gonna forward the information to [inaudible] and that she could contact my teachers and everything and sort of let them know what going on also really need to go to the chiropractor but haven't heard back from them um so i'll be calling again tomorrow to try and set up an appointment for some time this week and hopefully they're resolved and also have two work shifts this week which shouldn't be too bad overall and have quiz tomorrow that i'm pretty worried about i'm not really sure how it gonna go and then have test on tuesday that i'm also really worried about so i'll just have to see how everything turns out but looks this week will be pretty busy am planning on going to get [inaudible] from the bureau of study counsel so hopefully that'll help with some of my class anxiety today overall was pretty good woke up on time made it to all of my classes had [inaudible] so it went lot better than expected it to [firstly] because part of it was group portion and got to collab with other people in the class that have similar ideas to me which was really nice um was little unprepared for my lab but think went through fine and managed to get some help on the [inaudible] which means there one less thing to prepare later in the week have test tomorrow i'm definitely not super prepared for it but only have one class tomorrow so should have plenty of time to study in different [inaudible] also managed to make an appointment with my chiropractor so should go do that thursday which should definitely help me start to feel better thursday is [inaudible] busy and this weekend shouldn't be that busy but not too bad especially since we have long weekend which will be really nice too so week is pretty much looking up today was fine overall woke up late but still managed to make it to class on time um went over few things have quite few things to do by thursday but it shouldn't be too difficult 'cause also finished some assignments early have two workshops this week which should be okay and also have two appointments at the doctor this week which will be nice 'cause really need to go to the chiropractor today was so sore and didn't want to get out of bed but still did went to class and took my exam it went fine not as well as wanted it to but just wanted to get [inaudible] on it to get passing grade better um other than that finished my homework pretty early so got to spend some time relaxing with friends from the study group which was nice we ran into few other people so um overall it was pretty good day and the rest of the week is looking mild-busy not too bad have work thursday friday and saturday i'll probably go shopping on sunday and we have monday off which really monday to relax as well today woke up and felt too sick to make it to class so skipped my first class and it recorded and can just rewatch the lecture later managed to make it to my second class and my third class um and came back and relaxed between both times and put ice on my back uh then went to my last class and when came home did some work and then fell asleep and slept for about three hours and woke up not feeling too great but still managed to get some homework done but ended up staying up way too late 'cause couldn't feel good didn't feel good and really felt like couldn't concentrate on my homework because my head hurt so bad but i'm going to the doctor tomorrow so i'm gonna finish up the assignments that have due tomorrow and then hopefully after see the doctor it'll be better my roommate also having some people coming to stay with us but it only for night and i'll be gone most of the day tomorrow so it should end up being all right other than that i'm really glad it long weekend so that can get some stuff done have quite bit of reading to catch up on so we'll see how it goes today woke up on time went to my classes um felt like they went pretty well was had chiropractic appointment which was okay and definitely felt better after going to it didn't have headache anymore but then was late to my counseling appointment which wasn't good 'cause won't be able to see her for another two weeks and i've definitely been more emotional lately and have lot more going on think i've missed few classes and things like that but am getting tutor so hopefully that will help uh there some drama back home heard from friend who having really tough time but was really glad that she reached out to me because care about her lot so even if have lot going on i'd still wanna be able to be there for her um we have some people staying in our room visiting but it not too bad and they'll be leaving tomorrow and i'll be busy basically all day long so won't [have to deal with them] much had really tough work shift so i'm definitely physically exhausted and emotionally exhausted so i'm really glad it the weekend and i'm really glad we have long weekend holiday so hopefully i'll be able to actually like catch up on some reading and get some shopping and stuff done with friends so today woke up on time for my class um [inaudible] managed to make it all to all of my classes was pretty tired though so after finished took nap and was supposed to make it to work but didn't so i'll just do my hours tomorrow instead um stayed up way too late 'cause we had friend over 'cause have an early work shift tomorrow but think it was still okay um had an okay time with the friend and everything but i'm still having some issues overall and won't be able to go back to counseling for two weeks um so we'll just have to see how it goes but did reach out to some of my family and sort of talked through some of the issues with them which definitely helps little bit and went to get some shopping done that i've been meaning to get done which was really glad about uh have quite bit of homework and reading to do over this weekend but it also long weekend which should help and i'm meeting with tutor tomorrow for the math and should be getting science tutor sometime soon so that should definitely help me catch up and feel more on top of my studies so should be all right today was all right went and worked both jobs um spent quite bit of time doing my homework and also got to relax little bit because no one was home we were gonna have party night but then we didn't so i'm just spending some time in my room working on art which is really relaxing um met with the math tutor and that went really well got my psat done so was happy about that but then later got my pre-mid-term grade back and it wasn't as great as wanted it to be which was sad but can do corrections and make better grade and now i'll be working with the tutor so hopefully i'll do better in the future and tomorrow i'm planning on getting up pretty early and going shopping with friend so that should be pretty nice other than that um talked to some of my family back home because i've been pretty upset about my cousin and few other things and they helped especially since won't be able to go to my counselor for two weeks so talking to people at home really helps um but also got to talk to my friends that haven't spoken to since basically since left home and moved here so that was really fun and we made plans to hang out over christmas break when we're both home um and talked about some of our other friends so hopefully we'll all get together think really can't wait for break to be able to see everyone again back home and take some time with the friends that i'm i'm used to and i'm close with so today was fine um slept way too late last night so woke up kind of late this morning and spent basically the entire day out shopping with friend of mine um spent little bit more money than wanted to it was all basically essential stuff so feel okay about it still um was pretty tired from all of that so came back slept for bit then did laundry which was frustrating because the dryer broke so my clothes didn't get dry so had to hang them all over my room um then spent the rest of the evening with my friend and we watched some scary movies which kind of freaked me out and then my roommate got back home way later and was sort of weird about it but didn't really [inaudible] and then um another friend was nice enough to come over and hang out with us so we ended up staying up too late again and have quite bit of homework need to get done and i'm pretty upset about the grade on my um pre-midterm but my teacher emailed me about meeting and trying to go over the problems so i'll do that and then we're gonna try and arrange to meet with my um tutor because she should be able to help me with some of it as well so hopefully it'll turn out all right today basically just stayed in my room all day working on homework um got to sleep in little bit which was nice and my [inaudible] just checked in to see how was doing talked to some friends from back home and some family members from back home which was pretty nice um other than that am little worried about the week it pretty busy have lot of appointments and just realized double-booked some time next week so have to try and get that sorted i'm only working two shifts for one of my jobs which isn't too bad so i'm [inaudible] don't have to cover anything and other than that i'd really like to have monday off because it like don't know more time to relax and should have focused on homework little more but it won't be too hard to catch up during the week uh i'll just be pretty busy so i'll see how it goes i'm planning on getting up pretty early tomorrow um so can turn in my homework before going to class [hopefully] i'll make it on time to turn in my homework after class so it not too big deal so it should turn out all right today went really well was on time to class was able to talk to one of the guys from my class about my presentation so felt pretty good about that thought it was gonna be really bad but hope not so just have to wait on that one longer went to the chiropractor and the doctor see is really awesome we talked for while and she gave me some tips on how to stay in better shape um and my back and everything feels lot better today um got to talk to my grandmother on the phone for while which was really nice and did stay up little bit too late doing homework but it just because i'm worried about presentation have on thursday i'm meeting with the tutor for the class tomorrow though so it should turn out all right um class today was really interesting and tomorrow have an early class that i'm not too excited about but it shouldn't be too bad also got to work with my math tutor today which helped lot and got set up with my science tutor which i'm excited about because feel like i'll start doing lot better in both of those classes once begin meeting with the tutors so overall it been going pretty well and actually went out to dinner um for the first time in while to [inaudible] normally just stay in my room and eat so that was nice as well today went fairly well was few minutes late to class but it wasn't too bad and understood everything that they talked about during lecture which was really nice um also got back really good grade today which made me happy have presentation tomorrow that i'm little bit worried about but also met with the tf to go over it which made me feel little bit more confident about it and made some plans to study because have three tests next week with some other people who are in similar classes to me um also have plans to hang out with friend on friday which should be nice and we should be having some people over um to our room tomorrow night and friday night and maybe on saturday and sunday so it looks like it will be pretty busy but it will be nice to relax and hang out with people while also still getting work done since midterms are next week um i'm pretty confident about one of my midterms the other two i'm kind of worried about but started going to tutor so that should help um also have counseling on monday which i'm looking forward to and have work shift tomorrow evening that i'm not super excited about but hopefully it won't be too bad and can get it done fairly quickly and still have time to do homework and hang out with some friends so and i'm not i'm pretty busy but i'm still finding time to relax because know otherwise i'll just get way too stressed out and not get anything done today was pretty good woke up on time for class um and got dressed up since had presentation today which also went really well um my tf really liked it hope get good grade um and started preparing for my midterms so feel little more confident in those um 'cause have three next week it will definitely be busy weekend i'm working two shifts so that should be fun but i'm going to get coffee with friend tomorrow which will be really nice so overall everything going pretty well i'm definitely gonna study lot in preparation for my midterms so hopefully they'll end up being just fine but we'll see other than that um have an appointment next week to meet with my advisor which will be really nice which just scheduled and then i'm also gonna make an appointment to get some points back on my math pre-midterms since didn't do super well on it but i'm doing better than expected in science stayed up way too lat-late tonight so debating skipping my 900 am tomorrow but if wake up on time i'll probably be going or just going to it little bit late i'll just have to get ready really quickly so hopefully i'll still make it because really need to stop missing that class i've already missed twice today was all right slept through my morning class 'cause slept too late last night but went to all of my other classes which were really good and started preparing more for my midterms um spent some time shopping with my friends um we had little get-together tonight and got to hang out with one of my friends from my hometown we went out for coffee and then he came over later to hang out and it was really nice because haven't seen him in while and he just really good person to talk to and to be friends with um other than that we really didn't see anyone and probably stayed up way too late again 'cause have shift in the morning and then have [inaudible] [dorm crew] but should be able to get all of it done and then i'm really gonna focus on studying for midterms and my homework then i'm meeting with tutor on sunday and i'm meeting with the my advisor and probably the dean next week and have counseling session on monday that i'm looking forward to so just after after next week hopefully everything will calm down little bit because won't be as busy once finish all my midterms so then this week it will definitely be really stressful but then after that hopefully i'll get little break today was fine spent most of the day hanging out with friends um didn't really spend lot time doing homework and spent lot of time doing work work which still haven't even been paid for which is kind of frustrating 'cause could really use the money especially 'cause my friends wanna go shopping and don't really have the means to right now and still need to get winter coat and boots think i'm gonna have to quit one of my two jobs because it totally been too much lately um we went to party tonight which was fun but also just like still didn't really talk to anyone because it was like smaller get-together so hopefully in the future i'll go to bigger ones um but it was still pretty enjoyable thing and have lot of midterms comings up so uh tomorrow i'm definitely gonna spend my day studying um hopefully don't sleep in too la-late i'm gonna set some alarms so that get up and have meeting with my proctor still meeting with my tutor and uh going to [inaudible] together so hopefully we'll do all of that and can get like caught up with my work and be little prepared because thought was prepared for some of midterms but then when looked up at the study guides realized that there some stuff that i'm really not ready for um feel like i'm falling behind in my classes little bit but like hopefully i'll catch up and just wanna get through these midterms and then it'll hopefully get better for while so hoping my roommate okay and i'm meeting with my counselor monday so can like talk things through with her but really just think need to expand my circle of friends so we'll see how it goes but tomorrow hopefully i'll i'll actually do like lot of work and everything today was fine uh some people to go [inaudible] one of the problems that for class which was really nice kinda struggled with another problem set for different class but in the the end figured it out pretty much uh with help from the friends studied little bit for my midterms should study more but spent more time catching up with friend that hadn't seen in while which was really nice because feel like that helps me to be in better place mentally when hang out with some other friends um so it was really fun we got to bake and haven't been able to cook anything for at least like [half] year so it was pretty relaxing um other than that really slept in too today because was up really late last night so it makes sense and hopefully after get through this week everything will calm down because midterms will be over have [allowed] for around [inaudible] too and then the week is pretty busy overall with appointments and other things um suppose just need to power through it and then hopefully everything will calm down go back to more regular schedule where won't be as stressed today was my busy day um had lot of classes [since i'm in] lab which was fine but it was also [quite bad] because needed time to study and slept too late last night which do lot lately other than that getting ready for my test this week but have little bit of time tomorrow to prepare and even if we go [inaudible] have options to like make it better and find other ways to deal with stuff um so hopefully overall it won't be like too hard or anything um the rest of the week is still pretty busy but i'll just be relieved to be over with all my midterms by thursday and after that think i'll take few days to relax and then go back to studying so can be prepared for future assignments and the final which is like project coming up uh two mondays from now so i'll probably start working on that um during next week and my sister will be coming for parents weekend so definitely wanna finish early today was fine made it to all of my classes um was definitely pretty stressed out because have midterm tomorrow that i'm really not ready for but did well on my other test and i've been doing well [on other] [inaudible] even if do poorly on this midterm should still be fine for the semester overall especially if do better on the last two tests we have and have two more midterms thursday also have work shift because couldn't get it covered and have two meetings thursday so thursday so thursday is definitely looking pretty busy and then friday is little bit calmer so i'll probably do work shift friday and then two work shifts on saturday and then relax this weekend before diving back in and doing more work but it will have come down because i'll be finished with all my tests after this week so hopefully everything will get better and got to talk to my counselor yesterday and made another appointment and i'm going to physical therapy next week so it should probably help me get better and think i'm gonna quit one of my jobs so have more time to focus on school and and allow me to work my other job because just got raise so if do like four hours there week i'll be making pretty good money and it won't stress me out as much as my second job does so hopefully that'll help and my meeting with my academic advisor should definitely help as well because he always very straightforward and gives really good advice so hopefully everything will get better just once i'm passed all this testing today was fine woke up on time and got to study little bit before my midterm um it went better than expected it to but not still too well had to [twist up] clues which went okay i'm just little tired and [not too focused] so um yesterday made it to classes and got quite bit of studying done so hopefully i'm fairly prepared for my midterms tomorrow um tomorrow going to be quite busy day but i've decided to get into the routine of going to bed at certain time and waking up at certain time so i'm going to be trying to go to bed at around 1200 and trying to wake up at around 730 every day and we'll see how that goes so in the morning i'll have some time to prepare and get some breakfast and coffee maybe before finding my way to my first midterm of the day and then have some meetings and then i'll have my second midterm then work so it definitely busy day but it just today and then mean tomorrow that i'm probably gonna have to get through and then the week will be over so hopefully everything ends up just all right today had two midterms the one in the morning went fine the one in the uh evening didn't go so well and got got bit upset but quit my second job so i'll have less stress so can focus on school and be more prepared for the rest of the semester my sister coming next weekend don't know if [i'm looking forward to it] and she probably gonna bring me some winter clothes which will be really nice because thought was gonna have buy some new stuff but now won't have to um other than that also met with my academic advisor today and he made me really excited about some opportunities for study abroad over the summer so i'll start looking into those and i'll probably apply to those over winter break 'cause applications are due in january think i'm gonna end up staying here for thanksgiving break but that okay 'cause can just go to new york for thanksgiving to meet up with my sister and it'll be nice and then i'll be going back home for christmas we're [talking] about booking flight um so hopefully can get around to that sometime soon um i'm gonna try to go to bed early even though my [inaudible] probably [inaudible] but want to get up early in the morning 'cause i'm trying to stick to new schedule that getting up at 730 and going to bed at midnight so hopefully i'll do that and i'll be fine and then this weekend i'll have some time to relax and party and also get caught up on some school work going into the week um shouldn't have too much homework so it should all end up being okay today wasn't feeling too well but still made it to all my classes and did everything important that needed to do and was gonna go to work but since wasn't feeling well decided to sleep for while um feel little better but not much and have two shifts of work tomorrow so i'm going to bed finally but still have to get up early and do the shifts and may end up just sleeping more also need to try and get some homework done but guess wanna see how feel how sick am or not and decide whether or not to get my homework done from that my sister coming next week which is exciting also have to try and um ship package for my other sister because her birthday is coming up next weekend talked to my best friend tonight and haven't heard from him in probably like two months so that was really nice and hope that we can talk again and i'm supposed to call my sister tomorrow morning while i'm at work hopefully my work shift is easy 'cause probably still won't be feeling well and i'm gonna have to get up really early because have to get it done before 1100 so i'll need to get up at like 730 and go to work by 800 but should still be able to finish it so i'll see how it goes today was pretty good but um woke on time because had two work shifts did both of those um spent quite bit of the day relaxing i've got all the homework done and spent time with cleaning and reorganizing my room which really made me feel better so it was nice um spent the evening out partying with friends it was pretty fun but have to wake up early tomorrow to [help me] with tutor that'll be good 'cause it'll help me get all my homework done and to make sure it right um hopefully i'll spend the rest of the day prepping for my other classes that don't have tutor for uh uh and we'll see how it goes i'm glad that don't have any work tomorrow 'cause i'm really tired did something to hurt my foot so it kinda hurts to walk on and i'm not really sure why but don't know mean it not too bad so um feel okay and i'm just waiting to get my paycheck because haven't been paid yet and i'm running little bit low on cash so hopefully my manager pays me sometime soon today was fine work up little late so was few minutes late to my meeting this morning but it wasn't bad um had quite bit of my homework done pretty early on but then kinda lost motivation throughout the day and was really being little lazy but still finished everything by reasonable time and i'm having some problems with my bank so was having to deal with that and try and plan for the week 'cause my sister is gonna be coming so have to get assignments and work done earlier so that have time to hang out with her and everything um actually made it to annenberg today for lunch and dinner um which was nice and also went to brain break and got little snack and ran into friend which was cool but sometimes just wish that spent little less time with my roommate and my one constant friend because [inaudible] kinda frustrating um struggled little bit on the math homework and in the end figured it out but my roommate didn't and she [inaudible] [bad mood] and her and my friend are both sick and so really hope that my roommate sick because don't really have time for that since have to stay on top of everything and when my sister comes she supposed to be bringing me some winter coats and things like that which will be really nice 'cause then don't have to buy them all and hopefully get paid some time soon for my other job because i've worked there for two months now and still haven't been paid and that actually the job quit so have one last shift on thursday night which is poor timing 'cause that when my sister will be here but she said she'll do it with me so we'll see how that works out but hopefully they pay me soon because really need to put the money in the bank especially since i'm having some issues with the storage [inaudible] in my car and [inaudible] so today was long day have bunch of classes uh was almost late to my first 'cause didn't know there was construction in the yard managed to turn my set on time and to class on time um second class went by just fine was just little bit sleepy then got to grab some lunch before going to third class which was nice and then had lot of time to relax and get some work done and talk to my family before went to my next class and it was pretty stressful because [inaudible] is lab so it takes really long time um my group kept having things happen made us take even longer and then our tf even messed up the end of our experiment so we might not even be able to use the results and was pretty exhausted after that so got dinner and took nap but my alarm didn't go off so ended up sleeping for like five hours which means that have to stay up later preparing for my classes tomorrow tomorrow is gonna be pretty busy day so i'm gonna try and get up early do some homework maybe get breakfast and go to class and i've gotta run by the mail center get few things off work shift at my job and then um have an appointment before my evening class so it will be pretty busy and then i've got pretty long math assignment but can get some help on it with my roommate and my other friend so it should be okay today was okay really didn't sleep well last night 'cause was not feeling well and was just too [keyed] up to sleep but still went to class on time and everything and it was really interesting um went to work for bit that went really poorly just had lot of complications so i'm going to work again tomorrow for another hour to fill my two hours for this week uh hurt my foot so it really hard to walk right now but hopefully it will get better before thursday because have the um my last shift for the hsa and my sister coming in talked to my counselor today it was just really nice it little frustrating because won't be able to see her for until november um it would be really really good to see her sooner than that 'cause i've definitely been pretty stressed out so [oh well] ts it definitely busy week with lost of homework but we'll just see how it goes in the end hopefully my sister coming here will help to calm me down little bit wasn't feeling too well today woke up late and got ready quickly went to class my foot was still hurting quite bit and had headache but still went to all my classes and had little lunch and went to work and then um had an appointment with physical therapy which went okay but think if i've set up three more appointments but think cutting back at everything will definitely help quite bit um and now have this some exercising to do at home and was really relieved because got winter coat fund and my sister also bringing some winter coats so then should be able to save some money by not having to buy as much um other than that talked to my family about maybe changing my plane ticket so can drive back with my siblings instead but i'm not really sure um and my sister coming tomorrow tomorrow pretty busy day 'cause have quite bit of homework and uh wanna spend time with her and also have to work shift but it should be all right 'cause [can get] help on the homework and plan to do some of it during the day at least and got midterm back tonight that didn't do so great on but sort of expected that and it just i'm just gonna have to work hard to make up for it in the future and hopefully i'll get midterm back tomorrow that will be much better grade so we'll see today went well made it to my classes on time had pretty busy day doing homework [inaudible] class and my sister came unprepared so again [inaudible] um that i'll be getting back my last midterm grade next week and then have another exam next week [inaudible] so i'll be doing quite few events um think i'm going to like five different things on saturday and sunday i've already got two things scheduled and on friday have few things scheduled um and it also going to be more tough weekend 'cause my foot been hurting so [went to] huhs and they said that probably sprained it so they gave me some crutches which am definitely having some trouble walking on but hopefully i'll get used to them pretty soon um feel like i'm gonna have to get up little earlier tomorrow in order to make it to class on time getting ready and walking on crutches but with my sister being here it'll be super helpful um so hopefully it won't be too bad and mean should get used to it pretty quickly and am little worried about getting all my work done this weekend because know my sister being here will also be distraction but [inaudible] sunday to be able to finish up on [inaudible] if don't finish earlier than that 'cause have like guess four or five assignments to do over the weekend today was fine made it to all my classes although it was little bit difficult 'cause uh injured my ankle and had to get around on crutches it definitely harder was almost late to few classes but my teachers [everyone] was very understanding have quite bit of work to do [inaudible] next weeks [inaudible] pretty busy to with major assignment due on monday i'm getting [inaudible] wednesday and have an exam on tuesday uh so have lab report due monday on top of my normal homework and test corrections but i'm meeting with my tutors this weekend which will definitely help out with all the homework aspect and i'm just hoping that my it gets better quickly since it so hard to get around i'm um i'm probably not gonna go to [inaudible] tomorrow night 'cause i've already got quite few things planned since my sister in town [inaudible] [game] and an capella show and the orchestra so don't think i'm gonna make to dance as well because it'll hurt my ankle too much but today was really nice because got to relax after my classes and stay off it for while and then went shopping with my sister and we went out to eat so tried few new places and had some really delicious food which was really lovely [inaudible] been eating well since [inaudible] i'm really glad that she is here and that she'll be here until sunday morning so i'll probably get all my homework done on sunday but it'll be worth it to take break and to spend time with her while she here today was all right went to quite few events like the football game the fellowship was really awesome the orchestra was pretty good too little bit longer than wanted then went to party with my friends but they didn't wanna stay as late as did which kinda sucked but don't know maybe next weekend we can stay out little bit later 'cause was having pretty good time um other than that know have lot of homework to do tomorrow so might go to bed and i'm probably gonna get up around 1000 1030 'cause have an appointment at 1100 with my tutor to go over some [inaudible] stuff know i've definitely stayed on my ankle little bit too much this evening but hopefully it'll get better pretty quickly and i'm gonna ice it when go to bed which should help little bit at least um other than that think i'm gonna try and make some more friends 'cause really want people than can like trust to go out with and have quite few assignments due on monday so i'll be doing quite bit of homework tomorrow but past that need to plan for thanksgiving 'cause i'll be going to stay with my sister and her boyfriend instead of going home 'cause it too expensive to go home but just kinda regret it because wish could just be here having good time with good friends that trust so really need to find some people that actually trust but don't know how that'll happen 'cause i'm too anxious but hopefully my counselor will help me with it so we'll see how it goes today wasn't feeling too well so spent most of the day relaxing woke up pretty early showered met with my tutor to go over some stuff which was nice but then after that kind of just laid around for while and ended up taking nap because i'm not feeling well um my foot is really hurting so tomorrow think i'm gonna try [inaudible] so that it'll be little bit easier to get around [inaudible] won't be as difficult [inaudible] to so hopefully it'll just be fine like that hopefully my [foot] will get better pretty soon because i'm mean i'm taking medicine which helps and if it doesn't get better then [inaudible] um other than that do have quite bit of homework to do tomorrow um as had lot tonight that didn't really finish [inaudible] since spent most of the day laying around but [inaudible] 'cause have an assignment due by 900 pm i'm thinking about skipping one of my classes to work on it but think i'll probably still go to class and then just try and get it done 'cause should still have about five hours [and it only like] two pages so it shouldn't be too difficult to finish um other than that i'm kinda busy this week but it shouldn't be too bad hopefully [inaudible] [will be] easier before it gets harder today it went all right woke up on time with everything but wasn't feeling well 'cause my foot is still pretty sore and think i'm fighting with my roommate right now 'cause she been gone all day and hasn't come back um other than that uh today haven't [inaudible] 'cause it been long day so did them all and other than that had an assignment that was due at 900 pm but still managed to finish it just on time it just little under the word limit but it was flexible so it should be all right have an exam later this week that don't really feel ready for but i'm meeting with my tf tomorrow so that should help um other than that just hope get feeling better um maybe i'll go to the show [inaudible] in performance it friday but don't have anyone to go with so let me see i'll see what happens today was fine um only had two classes which was nice um [inaudible] was kinda falling asleep in the first class 'cause stayed up little too late last night probably stayed up too late tonight as well but have time for little nap tomorrow um do have [inaudible] 'cause have 900 am and it might be kinda busy after that hope if get my homework done early that should go to bed early which would definitely help um and other than that i'm getting mid-term back tomorrow and think did really well on it so i'm sort of excited for that and ch it was little bit difficult 'cause had talk with my [inaudible] 'cause i've been having some problems her and my other friend are [inaudible] probably all of it will just blow over went to haunted house which was fun but it was pretty scary and tried to make thanksgiving plans and christmas plans with my family which are slowly being worked out but just so stressful [as is] and don't know where i'll go to [inaudible] this week probably on friday or saturday since my foot is still really hurting from spraining my ankle but don't think can get any more time off 'cause already missed shift few weeks ago so see i'll probably just [inaudible] and taking some advil so my [foot doesn't hurt] too badly today was fine got back midterm that did really well on so was super happy about that and have kind of lot of homework but managed to get it done and got started on few other things do have test tomorrow that i'm little bit worried about but should have time to study before it um 'cause only have two other classes to go to um and in my other classes i'm gonna try and get up early in the morning so can finish some extra readings for those but it my favorite class so it won't be too bad today was pretty tired so did end up sleeping through one of my other classes but hopefully can make up the work for it tomorrow night and my ankle is still hurting pretty bad so i'll probably try and do my shift with my work on either friday the day after my last class or saturday um friday night i'm also going to friend concert which is gonna be really fun and had dinner with her this evening so i'm super excited about being able to go i'm gonna see her again on friday 'cause dinner tonight was really nice um and talked while with my family back home and tried to make some concrete plans for thanksgiving so hopefully get paid for my other job soon so can buy train ticket to go see my sister today had my favorite class which was really nice um and also made an appointment with huhs tomorrow to go get my foot looked at since it still been hurting other than that um had test this evening and think it went fine probably could have done better if looked over some more stuff but don't think that it [inaudible] test so hopefully still did okay though um got my homework done pretty quickly and stayed up watching some tv when really should have been working on some other stuff other than that found out that might actually be going home for thanksgiving which i'm pretty excited about um but still have to work out few of the details with my family and i'm also super happy 'cause i'm going to the [inaudible] with friend tomorrow so that'll be lots of fun today woke up late and ended up sleeping through my first class but it shouldn't be too bad because can definitely make it up pretty easily since the lecture is recorded online um went to all of my classes did quite bit of my reading and started some of my homework for this weekend so i'd say my day was really productive and also [inaudible] [to address] something in my special shoe where sprained my foot don't know how much i'm really going to wear it though because it not super comfortable and have work tomorrow so i'm definitely not going to wear it during work but i'll probably only do about two hours since my foot hurting so i'll just have to fulfill the requirement and then i'll probably spend the rest of the day trying to do homework and then have plans to go to an acapella show tomorrow evening and some of the people in my [inaudible] are going to be in it tonight or tomorrow is the performance but girl from my [dorm crew] was in it and it was super good and it was [inaudible] because went with my friend from back home and haven't seen him in few weeks so that was definitely fun and we made sort of made plans to go to the december one together as well so i'll be looking forward to that and i'm excited because think i'm going to get to go home for thanksgiving now and didn't think was going to so hopefully everything will work out and i'll figure out all my thanksgiving plans soon and i'm going to try and go winter clothes shopping sometime soon as well maybe this weekend today woke up late and my foot was really hurting so ended up not going to work and texted my manager but she didn't answer which was little bit frustrating um really wasn't feeling good so kind of just relaxed at home did leave to go to [redacted] and to go pick up some bagged food from the dining hall um which was nice because their bagged lunches are really great and even ordered one for tomorrow morning so hopefully can [just] pick it up on time um i'm also hosting someone but it interesting 'cause she stays out late and doesn't respond which means that have to stay up later than want to as well but she leaving tomorrow so it shouldn't be too bad um tomorrow i'm gonna start tutoring which will definitely help with some of my homework um then the week gonna be super busy but i'm super excited 'cause i'll be getting to go home for thanksgiving now which will be really nice was hoping to get in today but woke up and wasn't feeling too well my throat really sore so think might be getting sick now and i'm gonna try and go to bed early 'cause finished all my homework pretty early which will be nice 'cause i'm i'm probably gonna have trouble waking up tomorrow so just haven't been feeling well um tomorrow also my really busy day so it kind of sucks that i'm gonna be sick when have the most classes and the most stuff to do also have meeting tomorrow at the [bsc] and i'm still waiting to get back some news of the test which hopefully went well um think it went okay think it could've gone better but still think i'm okay um some of the homework had little bit of trouble with but still finished all of it so i'm still feeling pretty proud of myself for finishing um and other than that i'm looking forward to my on tuesday there are some classes and i'm happy because started doing packed lunches with [hohs] and with um [heds] so i've been able to actually eat food quite bit more like got the hummus and beef and it wasn't as good as back home but it was still pretty good and um ordered lunch for tomorrow as well so can make sure that continue eating when don't have time to actually sit down and have lunch in the dining hall so i'll probably continue to use them because it really great service and hopefully my foot gets better and my throat will get better soon because i'm really tired of being sick today was my busy day um finished with [inaudible] sort of on time read it pretty quickly and was almost late to turn it in because [inaudible] but still managed to make it which was good um perhaps it fine went to bed early last night 'cause wasn't feeling well but was definitely feeling better today i'm still not 100 i'm definitely better than was yesterday um [inaudible] so life is getting better and my manager replied so went to see [inaudible] work which was nice um was little stressed out because found out that have two tests next week and thought only had one and [inaudible] just gonna to try [inaudible] also have lot of papers coming up that we should be getting an assignment for either tomorrow or thursday um i'm supposed to have meeting today but they canceled in the last minute so had to reschedule that for wednesday and have two more meetings tomorrow um one with physical therapy which will be interesting because it will be my first time working with them and the other with my counselor which were really nice since i've begun to see her [inaudible] um hopefully we can be productive 'cause normally we run out of time to talk about things um other than that talked to my mom today which was really nice 'cause she looking forward to coming home for thanksgiving um so just my grandmother [inaudible] [out] and surprised her but [inaudible] tell her checking the news definitely made her happier and [inaudible] can [inaudible] something to look forward to 'cause really need break from the atmosphere and the people here but uh i'm trying to [inaudible] tomorrow when we get breakfast but don't have time but depending on how feel in morning might just decide need the extra sleep so we'll see today didn't wake up as early as wanted but still woke up in plenty of time to get to class and class was super interesting so was really glad um after that had little bit of time to do my reading and eat pretty good lunch um because still have food from the packed lunches i've been getting ordered two for tomorrow but won't be able to pick them up until one o'clock because of my busy schedule which is little annoying but it fine um whatever um other than that had meeting with my therapist which was really awesome really enjoy talking to her and she always understands me um and had meeting with pt for the first time which was definitely bit of struggle but think it'll be really nice to start building up more strength and feel more comfortable and confident with myself um especially because it going to help my back and think overall i'm going to be lot happier and it'll make it lot easier to function in everyday life um what else have two tests next week which am not too thrilled because don't feel like i'm ready for either of them got test back today um but didn't do too great on it so we'll just see how it goes mean should have time to study over the weekend and can meet with my two groups of friends to help so that will be nice today was fine and i'm definitely getting sick so ended up sleeping through my first period class um but it-it definitely not gonna be like too hard to make up because they have the lectures online and everything um so it okay that um stay and still went to all my other classes was at meeting with the [redacted] state council which was pretty nice and they had some good tips on how to prepare because have two exams next week that am totally gonna need lot of time to study for um stayed up little too late trying to work on [inaudible] assignment that i'm not exactly fond of but definitely have time to finish it tomorrow um just have to focus and get it done and tomorrow only have uh two no three classes um so it won't be too bad to go to all of them even though i'm not feeling well probably just won't be able to talk as much which won't be too bad but do have some questions for my tf so hopefully can still talk enough to ask him questions i've just been drinking lot of tea and doing lot of cough drops to try to make it better but think also need to get some medicine so might try and run by the store tomorrow if have time to get some honey and some medicine and maybe some more cough drops and maybe some soup um 'cause being sick definitely it not but luckily have off work this week because sprained my ankle um so hopefully i'll be better before have to go back to work next week and before have all of my exams next week and i'm gonna try and sleep it off little more this weekend today was not the best i've gotten really sick and basically lost my voice uh had trouble in classes and i'm just not feeling well so was having trouble doing [inaudible] 'cause really just wanted to lay around and not do anything but [inaudible] tomorrow um so hopefully can get that taken care of and and sleep i'm gonna sleep in tomorrow and not go to my first classes 'cause keep waking up from coughing and i've had like three nose bleeds now so don't don't wanna like go to class and then get nose bleed in the middle of class um so i'm probably have to go to [inaudible] to make up but feel like that the better option it not [inaudible] trying to go to class while feel horrible um so i'll probably email my professor tomorrow evening there one class that have to go [inaudible] section but it only an hour um really don't have to talk that much so that should be okay uh other than that talked to my tutor today about getting one of my assignments rescheduled um and he said he'll try work on it which will be nice 'cause was pretty worried about it and then i'm just really glad that it getting closer to me being able to go home for little bit which i'm really looking forward to feel like definitely i'm gonna need the break and the separation from people here um but to get to that point do have to get through two more exams next week and lots and lots of homework this weekend but hopefully it'll be okay and i've got long paper that [inaudible] working on so it definitely getting getting busy this morning wasn't feeling well so so ended up sleeping in and missing all three of my classes and then went to [inaudible] and they said that have bronchitis so i'm taking me some prescription medicine which will hopefully help but now have even more work to make up this weekend which sucks because also wanted to like have fun do some stuff but guess i'll really have to focus on my homework i'm definitely looking forward to thanksgiving break so think just need to power through next week and get all my shit done so over thanksgiving break can relax for bit and take some time off 'cause will still probably be sick for while and hopefully my teachers will be understanding 'cause was up coughing most of the night which was why slept in and missed my classes i'm probably gonna try and schedule meetings with my tutors uh gonna try and actually get up on time tomorrow 'cause i'm probably gonna be tired but i've got to [inaudible] so definitely got to drag myself out of bed feel like i'll definitely feel better since spent today resting mostly so hopefully tomorrow won't be too bad maybe i'll start to get my voice back which will be really nice was still sick today so woke up early from nosebleed kept feeling pretty bad on and off all day long um um called [redacted] again but they really didn't tell me anything different so i'm just gonna have to [wait] till it gets better if it doesn't go can um find bit of work to do tomorrow since haven't done anything since haven't been feeling well um 'cause have all of sudden [inaudible] things like that but hopefully i'll be able to figure it out and get it done even though am basically pretty sick um [inaudible] run to the stores but other than that didn't really [inaudible] my bed for that matter 'cause resting and get over it [the best] so suppose my [inaudible] is resting today was my pretty busy day um 'cause have lot of homework that needed to get done and lot of stuff to prepare for during the week but it was definitely really difficult since hadn't been feeling well and i'm still not up to 100 um [inaudible] back to being able to talk [inaudible] normal voice compared to earlier in the week but i'm still having pretty bad cough and stuffiness and it definitely [inaudible] my homework tackled as i'm having lot of trouble being able to focus and think things through and don't think [inaudible] because feel too [inaudible] to like [inaudible] and probably should have been definitely had difficulty completing and understanding my work um i'm definitely behind but hopefully as get to feeling better can get [back] caught up 'cause have two tests [inaudible] this week so i'm definitely really busy this week [inaudible] myself to get through and [inaudible] go home and take break during thanksgiving so just gotta get through this week today was great i'm still feeling pretty terrible did get back [inaudible] slightly better but have two tests coming up [inaudible] quite bit of homework and two more major assignments due next week so i'm stressed out and i'm still sick and today it kinda got worse and still went to all my classes anyway but right after that came home slept for long time which definitely put me behind my work so ended up staying up later to make up for it and know tomorrow gonna be really busy because my first exam of the week is gonna be on wednesday and have few practice [exams] need to take on top of the homework for other classes things like that um but hopefully tomorrow i'll be back on time because this morning woke up late and was supposed like [to do] my homework but have later class tomorrow morning so guess can still sleep in little bit and be on time and ordered food so that will actually eat tomorrow um [would like] to go so that can go back to my room and try to focus and work on quite few things 'cause need to do homework during the day and then at night can study for my exam that on wednesday so just need to stick to that plan but have it gonna be hard 'cause also have an appointment with physical therapy tomorrow and haven't been able to do my exercises since i've been sick but um it should still be okay today was all right um was almost late to class but managed to make it on time um throat still [hurting] don't have time to go to huhs like i'm starting to lose my voice again which sucks um did have to go [go through] some therapy today which was tiring but pretty good [inaudible] which is nice 'cause [inaudible] and my [back] isn't doing as bad [inaudible] some exercises today um have test tomorrow and then test on thursday and bunch of assignments due [inaudible] overall [inaudible] gonna have to shop for my sister birthday 'cause i'm home for thanksgiving have to give her present and have to go to the grocery store as well so we'll see if can get everything done on time hopefully will be able to today was all right um had to wake up early because had test um but think it went slightly better than thought it was gonna go feel pretty confident that at least passed so that good um was annoyed because [i've had] emailed extra work for class tomorrow like tonight that i'm not ready to do um which definitely sucks because sort of had busy night with lots of work and i'm just extra stressed um so i'm gonna try and get that done tomorrow between classes have test tomorrow night but think i'm gonna have to focus on other things which isn't necessarily the best idea however did prepare so that if did poorly again can do retest 'cause did extra work to ensure that so even if do poorly on the test tomorrow i'll have an opportunity to make it up which can definitely be nice think i'm getting slightly better [from being sick] but can't really tell um at least have [inaudible] back but kinda sucks 'cause was feeling good today so napped through one of my classes that will be easy to make up for but still should've probably gone to lecture um but it okay i'm really happy 'cause have few days before [inaudible] [break] [inaudible] get to go home and see my family and take break so that'll be really nice just have to get quite few things done before can leave like shopping and packing and some assignments so we'll see how it goes today went pretty well was busy but was also super grateful and had test this evening think it went better than thought that it would um talked to few of my family members today which was super nice because i'll be going home in five days and i'm really excited um made plans with friend to hang out tomorrow which should be lot of fun and then i'll still be getting errands done which is nice because have so many things to do before next week because have to prepare to go home and see everyone and take presents for some birthdays that have passed so i'll shop tomorrow have work tomorrow have class tomorrow and then have some major assignments due next monday but on saturday i'm going to the game so um probably won't do anything with that saturday but it okay because started some of my homework in advance tonight and and will probably start packing and some other stuff tomorrow night just to be extra prepared and ready to leave so i'm super excited for thanksgiving break it definitely time today was fine um woke up on time went to all my classes on time did really well in all three of them um and then went to work for two hours and had nice night with friend before came home and relaxed bit and did some homework because i'm going to the game tomorrow which will be basically all day long but then on sunday can work on some of my other homework 'cause i've got major assignments due monday and tuesday and just realized have test monday night um so quite bit of work done but after that i'll be able to relax and go home for while which will be super nice can't believe how close it is to the semester being over kind of insane but it should be all right still um hopefully mean and think i'm gonna pass all of my classes maybe not with as high grades as originally hoped but mean it period of adjustment so can always do better next semester and it only one semester of not so good grades so it doesn't matter too much and now i'll be better prepared for the future today started out well and ended up horribly um went to the game with good friend that don't get to spend lot of time with but my roommate was also there and some drama happened where we ended up getting separated and strayed with my other friend and we couldn't find my roommate so we headed back together and spent basically the whole day together and the evening and we did invite my roommate but she didn't wanna come so just hung out with my other friend and she super nice so we get along really well so we had really great time you know [inaudible] we watched [a few] movies and listened to music and she played guitar and then when came home ended up getting into an argument with my roommate over the cleanliness of the room and so the stuff that happened today has definitely really stressed me out especially because did come home with the intention of doing homework because i've got two major assignments due monday and tuesday and also have to prepare to leave for thanksgiving break on tuesday right after class so i'm not gonna have lot of time to work on those assignments otherwise um but just ended up spending most of the time arguing with my roommate so all got done was one of my science psets and still have my two major assignments due at least my little psets are done so we will try and still might get up kinda early tomorrow and finish up my two major assignments or 'cause one of them is due monday so can finish it tomorrow and get started on the second and then use some of monday to also work on the second but also need to pack and run few errands tomorrow so it'll definitely be busy day tried going to the proctors about the whole thing with my roommate but think i'm just gonna let it rest until after thanksgiving break and then see how it goes um especially since i'm going to see my therapist on monday as well so that'll probably help because she always has good suggestions on things to do um so i'll talk to her about it bit and i'm thinking about asking her if can start taking anti-anxiety medication 'cause feel like that might help me um with lot of things overall so we'll see how that goes and i'm also am am gonna have to set up meeting with my academic advisor which might try and schedule for monday but i'm not sure if need to work on monday so don't know yet if it'll work out the thing is i'll just figure everything out as it comes up just really ready to be home and take break and see my family today was all right slept in um [inaudible] nice 'cause got some rest went shopping so got some more birthday gifts for family members back home and finished my assignment um that was due tomorrow night so can focus on my paper tomorrow 'cause only have three classes and meeting but the rest of the time i'll work on my paper 'cause finished the majority of my packing so i'll be ready to leave on tuesday but i'm kinda taking lot of stuff home so think that i'll probably just end up taking an uber to the airport other than that i'm [still fighting with my] roommate ['cause] she only came home for little bit today and haven't seen her since um but honestly don't have time to deal with it so i'm just gonna let her rest till after the spring break and [see how it goes] but can talk to my counselor about it tomorrow which will be nice other than that i'm just trying to focus on my school work today was good woke up on time although did have little bit of troubs trouble sleeping last night then made it to all my classes turned in my homework on time and felt like really understood what was going on um which was nice then had an appointment and did little bit of shopping guess the only trouble really had today was not being able to focus on this essay just 'cause it over lot and also had to pack and prepare to go home tomorrow but but stayed up little bit later to continue working on the essay and try to go to bed by 100 and then still have my whole um flight and time in the airport tomorrow to work on the essay as well which will be good like three or four hours and even if don't finish it can still work on it at home since it due at midnight and it is only eight pages double spaced um so should be able to finish it all um might just not be able to cover everything that initially wanted to cover but still think that it'll be fine that i'll make good grade on it so i'm not super worried about it i'm just really excited to be going home and see my family today was good day only had one class that had to go to before being able to leave and head back home which was super nice but did have to focus on my essay because didn't finish it before left but it was okay because took some time at the airport and on the plane to write it so it wasn't too bad did start to write little bit after got home but got it in on time and i'm feeling pretty confident about how it turned out um so that really good other than that i'm just really happy to be home with the fam again um went to see everyone had to go and see surprise my family members and stop by and even see my grandmother so i'm really excited and definitely have at least few days to not do or worry about anything and just get back into the routine of being at home um so i'm now really looking forward to relaxing today was my first full day of being at home and honestly it just so nice feels like such relief not to be at school dealing with drama and actually being able to take break for once um really enjoyed it and kinda felt like spent the day doing nothing but it was nice to just relax and not do anything and even in doing that still went to work with my family and helped out at the restaurant so didn't feel particularly productive but still managed to be little bit productive um and just made me look forward to christmas even more and having longer break and [they're] really helping me um with my [inaudible] school because i've been struggling little bit especially [inaudible] don't want to go back which is [inaudible] because of my roommate but can definitely talk to shawn and rachel was little bit disappointed with my friends here but [inaudible] my school friends were really great people so guess shouldn't let it bother me that much that i'm not really hearing from them because have all my family and i'll see even more family tomorrow and it'll kinda be hard because already know what type of questions they're gonna ask me about school and relationships but at the same time i'll be really grateful to see them because they're all super supportive and you can really just tell how much everyone cares about each other so looking forward to thanksgiving today was thanksgiving and it was all right got to see my family but some family members are not exactly pleasant to be around [at least] grandma bread still okay mean had all of the good food and got to spend time together um just feel sort of distanced from the rest of my family especially 'cause i'm not feeling well which my family members think probably have strep which is great because have lot of stuff need to do and i'm stressing about money 'cause need to get good winter coat and boots but really don't have the money for it and especially with the holidays coming up have so many family members that i'm gonna have to buy them all presents and it still makes me angry to think about how much spend on textbooks that i'm not even using now but um guess there not much can do about it so i'll just have to try and pick up few more hours when go back to school so hopefully won't be feeling sick for too much longer tomorrow think i'm gonna stay home and rest up for bit which mean anyway will suck but anyway will also be good because can hopefully get some stuff done that need to get done and even if can't get winter boots should be able to go for the winter coat so mean hopefully everything will work out in the end today spent the day doing basically absolutely nothing at home which was kind of nice to be honest um kept thinking about school work thought about doing some of it but never got around to it guess just didn't have the energy um but am feeling lot better than was so hopefully i'm finally over whatever was sick with this time 'cause i'm really tired of being sick and hopefully will stay feeling better my throat will be stop being sore by sunday when it time for me to head back to school um my family has been good but also little bit frustrating but that to be expected and tomorrow think i'm actually gonna have to get up and go into work um but i'm okay with that because should also be able to spend the day getting some stuff done mean today at least did order my winter coat so that should be arriving and hopefully it'll fit and it was pretty expensive um i'm definitely gonna need to work some extra hours at my job whenever get back to campus but that shouldn't be too bad 'cause classes are just about wrapping up so hopefully everything will be fine today was good just went to work and spent the day with my family because tomorrow am headed back to school um [inaudible] packing and doing the laundry getting ready for the day which means i'll probably be pretty tired tomorrow but should be able to sleep on the flight and still have time to work on my homework so it should turn out to be just fine and i'm looking forward to going back to school but we do only have little bit of time left which will be nice 'cause i'm ready for long break in comparison to the short thanksgiving break which was nice but long break will definitely be more fun am little bit stressed about finals 'cause have to try and take one early so that can catch my plane back home but i'm gonna try and talk to my tf about it this week hopefully it'll be okay i'm little worried because have tests monday and tuesday that i'm not necessarily ready for but hopefully it'll still go fine went back to campus today so [inaudible] and my dad traveling really didn't get much sleep last night 'cause my little sister was here [inaudible] so stayed up with her but didn't sleep [inaudible] then after we cleaned for little bit which was nice i'm [inaudible] okay but [inaudible] was not super productive um and when got back did get few things done [inaudible] 'cause wanted to seeing as have really busy day tomorrow and an early class and [inaudible] last night but hopefully will still be fine in getting everything done 'cause have test tomorrow and test the next day that i'm not necessarily prepared for but should have little bit of time throughout the day to study um between classes and made sure to order foods that will actually eat and then just be able to go [inaudible] come back to my room to get some work done without worrying that i'm still definitely eating instead of not eating which will be good and i'm grateful for the packed lunch guess [inaudible] my life so today was all right woke up little bit late and was pretty exhausted all day long but still made it to class basically on time realized that this is actually our last week of classes which was definitely surprised about because thought that we still had two weeks um have like [grade that was] not quite as good as was hoping but honestly better than expected it to be had really busy day tomorrow today and have pretty busy day tomorrow too kinda sucked 'cause like didn't really have the motivation to do my reading and know that should've but really have to have it done till thursday which isn't much of an excuse but should be able to do some of it tomorrow so that wednesday have another test tomorrow night um that don't feel prepared for can study for it tomorrow but just feel like i'm not gonna be ready i'd rather write um 'cause haven't really had lot of time to go over the material it still basically new um just go ahead [inaudible] one of my other friends that don't hear from anymore so that was cool [inaudible] really just can't wait to get this over with and go home for break for month off [inaudible] that will just be really nice and really need that time to recover man prepare for another semester which hopefully next semester i'll be doing better so today went really well got to class on time and it was really fun did okay on my test this evening got quite bit of homework done because worked on all the stuff that due tomorrow and some stuff that was due friday so that i'll have less to do on tomorrow and scheduled an appointment with the resident dean to make sure that i'll be able to take my final early um other than that i'm just really glad that this is the last week of classes and i'm gonna start making plan on how to study during reading week um to try and make solid day-to-day of what plan on doing to prepare for all of my finals and then it won't be too long i'll be back home again so i'm really happy and looking forward to it other than that actually had to go to [inaudible] today and to eat which was really nice because normally don't get to do that but that was little sad because missed the classroom to [inaudible] with my basically my favorite professor but i'm thinking might go to his office hours just to tell him how much enjoy being in his class because it was probably my favorite course this semester i'm also really looking forward to thursday 'cause that'll be my last day with having that specific course and i'm waiting on quite few grades one grade the especially for that class um 'cause it major assignment that we turned in right before thanksgiving break so hopefully it'll be getting back to us pretty soon 'cause other than our final and our mentoring that still great weekend class and then for my with my other classes only have one more creative writing assignment to do which should be pretty good and especially because i've got um three out of the five back already and i'm making high in the class so so hopefully i'll get the fourth back this week and then i'll be able to tell with what need to do on the fifth to keep my grade an hopefully um so that was going really well and i'm pretty sure have really good feeling about my other classes because could definitely pass everything maybe not with but all these passed which earlier in the semester wasn't so sure about today didn't exactly go well woke up late and missed my first class my second class was still pretty good though do have lot of work that need to get done before reading period starts which will be little bit rough um later in the day [i'm still] [inaudible] class that was also really nice 'cause it the last time had to meet for that class um but then had an important meeting about some financial stuff and some grade stuff that really stressed me out and ended up missing my section 'cause forgot what hour it normally occurs in just guess since was so stressed around about the other stuff that was going on at that time but [i didn't] think about which means i'm really behind in that class which isn't good because our finals are coming up and we're not gonna meet again so i'll have to try make up the work with someone that know um [inaudible] little better 'cause got some good news later in the day um but [inaudible] still in weird mood and had lot of trouble concentrating on homework that needs to get done for tomorrow so feel like was super productive yesterday and not pretty productive at all today um especially as just like have not been feeling well so it been hard guess but hopefully will get over that 'cause still have to work shift this week so have quite few more classes and doctor appointment before this week is over so hopefully everything will get better and surely i'll be able to wake up on time tomorrow to prepare little bit before class before have to go and prepare little bit for section before have to get to that today was fine woke up later than wanted to but still got to class on time it was my last lecture for my favorite class um and really enjoyed it then went to [section] was little bit disappointed because didn't really talk and wanted to but did talk to one of my classmates after we got out which was pretty nice and got back grade that i'm super proud of and started thinking about how to better prepare for the final um also got quite bit of money and scheduled some time for work um and prepared for my appointment tomorrow so have my last four classes three classes guess of the semester tomorrow and doctor appointment [inaudible] [relaxing] and even made plans this we for this weekend with friend of mine which should be fun so looking forward to that and hopefully i'll just wake up on time tomorrow [inaudible] to bed little later than wanted since spent some of the day doing some unplanned things like [going to dinner] with friends and going shopping and running to the bank um so taking me little bit longer to finish my homework than thought but but it should still be all right and i'm glad because got done [inaudible] really so that can just turn it in tomorrow and not think about it and just have few more assignments and makeup stuff to do and then can start focusing on finance and hopefully working few extra hours at my job today was the last day of classes so was pretty excited about that and then finished everything it was okay was late to my physical therapy appointment but it still went really well and really need to start doing the exercises but for the rest of the day just kinda felt [really] depressed and pretty much just laid around [inaudible] switch my work shift to tomorrow 'cause didn't have the motivation to get it done and i'm really worried that i'm gonna keep feeling like this 'cause really need to get motivated so that can do my finals and complete the year in positive manner but just don't really see that happening mean have few things set up for next week and i'm meeting with my therapist so hopefully that'll help and don't know how to tell her that think might be depressed and honestly just look at it as an inconvenience because don't have the time to spend on something like this but it is making me lay around and and do my work for hours which really interferes with my life as whole because could have accomplished lot today or even gone out with friends but just didn't do it and made myself feel like more isolated than usually am [inaudible] plans with friend on sunday so hopefully that'll help but i've just been really unsatisfied with everything lately which sucks because was having really good day yesterday and today is definitely low today just basically slept in relaxed for while and went to work did spend little bit of time working on through my pt exercises which was nice and did leave to go get some food so treated myself but think the food turned into not so good idea because ended up pretty sick so don't know if it just because of the fever or just because haven't been feeling well in general lately but that definitely was not fun and was gonna go hang out with friend but he lives pretty far away so decided not to 'cause the [t] wouldn't be running so i'd have to get lift back to campus which is expensive so decided not to do that also found out that might have some homework to do on monday that definitely did not know about um so i'm little bit worried about that but don't think it'll be too difficult to do just have to figure out how it gets turned in so we'll see hopefully it won't be too hard other than that might start either one of my review guides or um my final [pre] for an exam tomorrow and hopefully my tf will email me back today slept in but slept little too late 'cause missed meeting with friend uh which was really upset about 'cause haven't seen him in bit and don't know if we're gonna get chance to hang out because we'll both be having fun also leaving for christmas break hopefully i'll get to see him sometime um other than that cleaned up the room bit and stuff but still didn't feel super productive 'cause didn't do any of my homework but don't really have anything to do until tuesday and wednesday so guess it won't be that bad but really need to get out of this little rut i'm in and start getting back to business because need to be prepared for finals um so hopefully i'll get over it sometime soon not really positive though um do have meeting tomorrow so i'll have to be see tomorrow when get up 'cause i've been staying up late and just sleeping in and then have meetings tuesday and wednesday so we'll see how everything goes today went pretty well woke up early and had an appointment [inaudible] and got some other stuff done and went shopping to get some healthy food in in preparation for final exams because there are few things that like to do to study certain way that works for me so bought all the stuff to prepare for that and then came back spent some time relaxing decorated my room little bit cleaned stuff up little bit to help me feel more relaxed and in control was planning on going to bed early but stayed up late because was hanging out with friend it was super nice so i'm still glad that did it and can sleep in little bit tomorrow as long as focus on my work after that because have an event want to go to an assignment due and another appointment and then have some appointments on wednesday that i'll spend tomorrow preparing for and other than that pretty much have an easy week um have to get started on my writing assignment it'll be due later but have plenty of time to work on it and i've already started thinking about it so i'm not super worried today was fine went to bed pretty late but still woke up on basically the time wanted to wake up got some work done and got it turned in and then even went to fair to go get some opportunities for next summer started planning for the future which is really nice 'cause ran into some people that knew um got to see them had appointment with my therapist that was really awesome it actually the last time went to see her before leave um and ran into friend today 'cause went out to dinner but also haven't seen him while so that was super cool and spent the rest of the afternoon getting little bit of work done and chilling um it been pretty relaxing have few things to do tomorrow that forgot about um which should still go okay um and then planned to start on some of my [inaudible] and major project that due monday so hopefully i'll be prepared for the finals 'cause i'm feeling okay about them right now today went by pretty quickly slept in little later than meant to but it was just good to take rest um had actually [inaudible] today so need to get [inaudible] and have to have enough for breakfast and lunch tomorrow saved in the fridge um also had meeting with my tf which was nice to prepare for one of my final exams that are coming up and i've started review sheet for one of my other classes so that should help to feel little bit more prepared i'm going to meet up with professor tomorrow even went to study break tonight with my entryway which don't normally do and it was fewer people than usual but i'm still pretty glad that went 'cause got to see my paf which was nice and got little bit [inaudible] [to apply] for [inaudible] i'll probably [inaudible] in my next semester and think it'll probably [inaudible] apply to few other things as well so i'll definitely [inaudible] so i'm getting out little bit more um tomorrow might also try and go to work um 'cause need to do my hours for this week [inaudible] weekend i'll probably try and go shopping for christmas stuff but have to [inaudible] [for food] today woke up and went to meet with the professor at about noon and we had short discussion which was truly lovely [inaudible] excited [inaudible] talked to him before uh so got back an assignment today that made really good grade on so was really pleased about that and went and did my work um so that been [inaudible] the week so can go do more hours if want but don't have to tomorrow i'll probably wanna try and get some christmas shopping done with my mom hmm and feel like some shopping [inaudible] true to myself and it will be nice 'cause [inaudible] come into little bit of unexpected money and also need to go and return the textbook and saturday will be devoted to starting nicely and maybe even to party with friend um [inaudible] another friend who [inaudible] sort of asking me about it i'm not sure it'll happen i'll be pretty pissed if he does though um [inaudible] i'm gonna try to sleep in little late tomorrow since stayed up late tonight though i'm going to try to set up an alarm so still have time to go shopping do everything wanted to do before it gets dark outside and before the stores close so hopefully will wake up with plenty of time today woke up not feeling too well and pretty cold so showered and spent little time to calm down and eat um and spent the majority of the day shopping for christmas which was really helpful because got basically everything needed to get done and there are few things that need to go and do tomorrow um also got to see friend this evening which was nice 'cause we watched one of my well my favorite film and then tomorrow night might be going out with another friend just have to hear back from them and then made plans with friend for tuesday night so think it'll be nice to do some social things however i'm also little bit worried about my finals um definitely need to start an assignment tomorrow and then need to start studying [inaudible] focus next week [inaudible] and make sure that i'm prepared for all of my finals because really wanna do well so i'll just end up seeing how it goes guess but [inaudible] think i'll make study guides for every single individual class um probably early next week have few more meetings with teachers as well which will help and then the night before each test can go over the study guide for quick review so hopefully that should help to prepare me well for the exams and i'm pretty confident about two of my courses the third i'm like fairly confident about and it really the fourth one that i'm super worried about but do have all the materials to study for it so it should end up being okay at least mean as long as pass and i've passed all the other exams so i'm not sure if don't pass the final if i'll still fail the class or not woke up pretty late this morning um it was snowing for the first time which was really exciting so went outside [inaudible] and got to talk to lot of my family members went to see the snow and got lot of pictures for back home [inaudible] know where i'm from um finished up the rest of my christmas shopping um and even got stuff for people that didn't expect to find anything for so it was pretty exciting and had to get back to the [inaudible] so obviously [inaudible] prepared 'cause i'll be leaving guess week from monday i'm really looking forward to it [inaudible] that [inaudible] finals [from] this assignment that have due for class and it [inaudible] about some pretty tough stuff so keep trying to start it but haven't been able to yet 'cause really have to think about what i'm gonna write about 'cause it has lot to do with um death and things um but i'm gonna have to finish it tomorrow 'cause it due monday night and then have finals friday saturday and monday um i'm little bit worried about my friday final lot worried about my saturday final and not really stressed about my monday final um but [inaudible] looking to [inaudible] skills and that should hopefully [inaudible] make me feel better not worse about my finals um and few others [inaudible] this week so uh still have little bit of time to relax and even though as do begin to study and prepare for finals kinda regret not starting earlier but at the same time feel like [inaudible] i've just been too stressed out if started earlier kinda get work better when it gets down to crunch time so hopefully everything will be okay i'm not gonna focus on getting an i'm just gonna focus on passing the classes so that should relieve some of the stress today woke up pretty late 'cause had pretty rough night sleeping last night um and really don't feel too well so pretty much stayed um in my room all day long and didn't eat food that was super healthy or anything which probably wasn't good but did leave for little bit of time to go to holiday party i'm excited that got to talk to few people that don't normally see and it was pretty nice [inaudible] made some soup really wish [inaudible] started all of my assignments but no motivation to do it um tomorrow think [inaudible] try and get up on time and get few things done so hopefully [inaudible] the assignment is due tomorrow at 900 so mean have fairly good idea what i'm gonna do but it still gonna be little bit difficult and might call my family for some help but i'm not positive yet so [inaudible] because even if don't do quite as well it should be all right since i've done really well on the other assignments for this class this semester and then need to start studying for my other finals that begin on friday today woke up [moments] again later than wanted to that probably 'cause stayed up really late last night which is why i'm going to bed earlier tonight and my roommate and are gonna set plan for tomorrow morning which will be really good um also even though woke up late still got few things done started some studying and finished my assignment that was due tonight little bit early was at meeting to sort of talk about how felt like my classes were going and how feel that things were going which was nice and then went to did some more shopping that didn't think about until the other day so that all set and i'm little bit stressed 'cause ordered package i'm not sure that it'll arrive before have to go home um but if it doesn't it not necessarily the end of the world i'll just be little bit annoyed um but am really looking forward to going home because it just gonna be week now and then i'll have the entire month off to relax and start making summer plans [inaudible] and tomorrow i'm definitely gonna be studying quite bit for my finals that are coming up i'm only really worried about one of them but will start studying for all of them um and also have [inaudible] little [inaudible] [date] tomorrow night so we'll see how that goes and still need to make an appointment with this physical therapy and with um my teacher to go over few more things before my final on friday so hopefully i'll get some stuff planned and everything set up tomorrow and also definitely really need to focus on studying so that can feel confident about [inaudible] exams today was pretty good um woke up pretty late 'cause i've been tired and i'm feeling super well today but still managed to get some studying done probably should have been little more focused than was but do still have tomorrow and thursday and half of friday to prepare for my first exam so it shouldn't be that bad um and then when wasn't studying ended up going out on date and it actually went super well and was really glad to have relaxing evening and probably spent little too much time out seeing as really needed to be studying but feel like it was kind of worth it because had really good time um and came back and kinda need to study but have little bit too much energy so hung out with friends for little bit and now i'm planning on studying and going to bed and hopefully i'll wake up little earlier tomorrow because do have some 900 am exams coming up so need to fix my sleep schedule for those um and also my food schedule need to actually start eating well which did tonight 'cause went out for my date um anyway have been eating lot of fruits and like yogurt and protein for breakfast so feel like that going pretty well um and just need to like keep it up now and probably order lunch from the dining hall tomorrow um which should be nice because their lunch is normally pretty good and can be like pretty healthy for you as well depending on what you get and i've still been eating lot of humus now might go work out tomorrow and also need to try and schedule an appointment with pt because tried to do that today but only got to on hold and they never answered the phone which was definitely little frustrating 'cause need to meet with my uh physical therapist before leave for break so that needs to happen sooner rather than later since have all my finals friday saturday and monday and then probably won't have time to see her then um and mean basically now what have planned is studying i'm really glad that got my shopping done earlier so don't have to worry about that and can really just focus on preparing for my finals and getting into the right mindset to do that today slept in way too late and didn't get much work done just really didn't have the motivation and it weird 'cause feel worried about my finals but at the same time don't [inaudible] but that that not really good because know that definitely need to study for them so hopefully get my motivation back tomorrow and my roommate and are gonna actually try and wake up early tomorrow 'cause we've been saying that but we haven't actually done it and did order food so that will make sure to eat healthy food rather than like junk food that i've sort of been eating and just have to work tomorrow so that should help me get some of my motivation back um and then need to make an appointment with pd which is gonna be little bit difficult 'cause forgot to call them today and have barely any time before i'll have to leave on monday um but hopefully all my finals go well and then over break have few things need to get done but i've also already started making plans to hang out with friends and stuff so will spend some time relaxing some time doing schoolwork and then working for my family um i'm [already less] stressed because have started packing so that will be helpful 'cause then once get really busy with finals won't have to worry about it as much and [i was able to do the] shopping need to do hmm really need to work more but can do that next semester probably 'cause plan on being way more on top of things next semester think kinda got into little funk this semester but hopefully i'll get it worked out over break come back more motivated for the [inaudible] today was all right woke up on time and [made little] breakfast which was really nice and got food for my lunch hmm had shift at work which was tiring but wasn't too bad um other than that talked to lot of friends back home which made me little bit more excited about break um and made plans with another friend to go to the movies before leave to go back home which should be really nice um but overall still got very little motivation to prepare for my finals which is really bad because my first one is tomorrow and then have another one on saturday and then on monday um i'm not too worried about my final tomorrow feel like it'll go okay and that i'll pass the class i'm really worried about my [friday] final so i'm gonna try and wake up early tomorrow so that have plenty of time to prepare for it and to do little bit preparation for my final tomorrow evening but um still like i'll be ultimately unprepared just hope still pass the class which the grading scale is different so feel like have pretty fair chance of passing [inaudible] with great grade but feel like that'll be okay because did really well in two of my classes not so well in the other two which is definitely new for me but [it was] little more challenging [inaudible] definitely had stressful semester so i'll be happy if just pass also forgot to call pt again today so gotta try and do that tomorrow 'cause don't know if i'll have time to set an appointment before leave to go back home now today didn't go super well woke up on time and spent the morning studying but my roommate came back pretty early and sort of distracted me and interrupted my study other stuff um she doesn't really understand that need to focus which is frustrating and we both had an exam in the evening feel like it went okay and then she kinda did more stuff that was really frustrating while was trying to focus 'cause have an exam tomorrow morning so didn't get nearly as much studying done as wanted to and i'm really not feeling super confident about the exam tomorrow but i'm just gonna have to do my best and hopefully i'll pass i'm gonna go to bed because don't wanna get no sleep but i'm gonna try and wake up fairly early to look over stuff before have to go to the exam just 'cause i'm not feeling very confident about it at all it is gonna be long [inaudible] which will hopefully help me make enough points on it to pass which as long as do that should be fine in the class which is little bit reassuring um i'm just ready for it to be over with so i'll take this exam tomorrow and then just have one on monday and then get to go home i'm happy because this weekend i'm hanging out with friend that don't normally get to see um so that really nice and might confide in him little bit with the the struggles i've been going through this semester so hopefully that will be okay and hopefully i'll just pass 'cause that all wanna have happen really today woke up really early and had final to take so started little bit before it and then um went and took it and it honestly didn't go super well um don't know feel like was just not feeling too well and didn't do as well as could've but mean it too late to fix it and really just hope that still finished enough stuff to pass which mean don't know surely did so hopefully it'll be okay and other than that um all my friends have left except for one that i'm seeing tomorrow and then i've got one more final before head back home so mostly packed i'm little worried because feel like i'm packing um not enough stuff 'cause all my presents take up lot of room um but should be okay in the end and definitely have time on monday to pack before have to get to the airport so it should all work out today went all right woke up later than wanted to because wasn't feeling super well um but still managed to um get some of my work done did have time [inaudible] to set up meetings and had talked to some people on the phone so didn't get quite as much studying done as want to do then had friend plans with friend for the evening but it was still really nice and i'm little worried about my final tomorrow but also know that i've been working pretty hard in this class all semester so should still do well on the final um as long just look over general information little bit more know the passage identification is gonna be little more difficult than the rest of its overall three canticles but hopefully they'll choose pretty easy passages considering it over the entire work um so feel like some of them will at least be recognizable might not get all the points but still have pretty good feeling probably mean i've 20 to do so should do at least 15 um and my essay writing has always been pretty strong so i'm not fully expecting to get an but definitely feel really confident about passing and i'm ready to go home i'm mostly packed there are few more things that i'm just mainly throwing into my suitcase and i'm thinking about ordering lunch so that can eat before have to leave 'cause can run and get it after my final hopefully but i'm also gonna have to try and get pt tomorrow so have to call them as soon as get out of my final um and see if they have anything which they probably won't so mean maybe won't end up having to do that but kind of really need to go to the chiropractor when get home and need to make sure get everything packed that i'm gonna need 'cause don't wanna forget anything here but should have plenty of time mean hopefully the final won't take th-three hours i'm just glad that the semester is over today went really well woke up on time had my last final which actually did really well on um get grades back in few days so i'm pretty confident about two classes the other two i'm not so much but hopefully still passed um and then uh after finished my final had time to grab lunch which was really good and cleaned up my dorm room before moving to go to the airport to head home for the holidays um it was kind of frustrating 'cause the airport ride took longer than expected cost lot more than wanted it to but managed to my get to my flight on time and then my flight actually turned out to be delayed so spent majority of the day on an airplane and got home super late um lot later than expected but mean i'm just really glad to be here and to have an entire month at home which do need to get some stuff done but also can just spend time relaxing and getting to see family and i'm pretty excited for christmas need to start um wrapping my gifts but i'm pretty pumped about it today got to sleep in really late which was super nice um and spent the day at home with my little sister and spent lot of time cleaning um and worked on some course evals so have one less actual work thing to do over break which is super nice now only have to focus on applying for seminars and um applying for summer programs that might wanna be part of and yeah overall it was just super [pretty] relaxing day um and made plans with friend to hang out which was really cool um because wasn't sure if he would want to over break but he does so hopefully i'll get to do that sometime soon and i'll get to see my extended family and my cousins too and plan to spend whole day with them um and so yeah [honestly] i'm just really glad to be home tomorrow i'm planning on going into work um but it should be really nice and also have few shopping things that wanna get done and people that want to see so i'm just so glad that it winter break and i'm still little anxious about getting my grades back but honestly i'm just trying to relax today was fine woke up little bit later than wanted to but it was still pretty early considering um then went to work first thing and stayed there for while which was mean nice um so it was just like my old routine getting back into it um then worked out with my brother which was little bit difficult because don't normally work out back at college but wanted to do it so was really glad and he was really helpful um which mean expected him to be so that was super nice and had really good time and i'm planning on making it daily habit so hopefully it'll be something that i'll continue doing once go back to college um i'm not super excited about tomorrow 'cause have to go and see some of my old friends who aren't all the nicest people in the world um so that should be interesting hope it'll be okay don't think anyone gonna do anything in particular it'll probably just be little bit annoying to be around them but shouldn't have to stay too long and there is one friend that am excited to see 'cause we're really close so at least i'll get to spend some time with him and then have plans with that same friend the next day as well um and need to make plans with some other friends and then have plans with my cousins the day before christmas and the day after christmas so i'm getting pretty busy but it really nice i'm little worried because get grades back tomorrow but it'll be nice to get it over with and stop worrying about that during break today went well slept in again later than wanted to but it wasn't too bad still got up and went to work and had good morning shift with some people that haven't seen in while so that was nice and then this evening saw some friends from back home which wasn't mean it was just about what expected it wasn't too horrible it also wasn't great but am just glad to see one of them that i'm actually really good friends with and super happy to see and tomorrow we'll hang out one-on-one which will be really nice and was also really relieved because well didn't get back all of my grades but did get back two grades that was the most worried about today and it looks like i've passed all of my classes i'm super glad about that and tomorrow i'll wake up kind of early have some chores to do and then i'm gonna shower and then i'll go to work again and hang out with some friends and tonight otherwise plan to spend time watching film with some family members which is really nice because it film that i've wanted to watch for really long time so it been nice break so far today was okay went into work again but got to spend some time in the morning relaxing before had to um and then spent the day at the restaurant mainly but it was really nice to be working um got to spend some time with with friend that didn't think i'd get to see today so that was pretty cool and hang out with her way better than expected to which was nice and then spent the evening with another friend and don't think i'll get to see him again before he leaves and we didn't get to spend as much time together as we wanted to but i'm still glad that got to see him overall um and should have plenty of time to see other friends from home and hopefully when my friend [back] from school that [i went to] my hometown as well so made plans with them but these next few days i'll probably just stay with my family um that should be nice 'cause we've got quite bit of stuff to prepare and to get ready for christmas but then after christmas we should have little bit more time to relax and just all be together today has been long day um woke up pretty late this morning and was really not feeling well um and continued to not feel good throughout the whole day basically went to work and [do have] few things that hope to clean up when get home need to clean lot i'm having really bad allergies think from being around all that animal stuff so spend more time dusting and sweeping and spent um my evening with my last my oldest sister who finally got home and it was great to see her and her boyfriend and then um we all ate little bit and have stayed up to wrap presents so that tomorrow evening we're not all as stressed about christmas um so stayed up pretty late doing that and just really started feeling horrible so i'm heading to bed and hopefully that will help so that won't feel as bad tomorrow but it kinda frustrating because my sheets are being washed now so now to put them on my bed before can actually go to bed and then they put all this stuff on the bed i'm supposed to be sleeping in so have to move it all off it little frustrating but it shouldn't take too long to do i'm just really not feeling well and we're supposed to go see lot of people tomorrow so really hope that start to feel better after wake up tomorrow morning i'm not even gonna set an alarm so that can probably sleep in little bit today was okay wasn't feeling super well so slept in quite bit um and then woke up and took shower and brushed my teeth to feel better and then ended up going back to sleep for while then spent the majority of the day relaxing with my family watched some shows played some games with them and also got an email about this [cancer] program applied to be part of next semester which was really happy about because it looks like i'll get to participate in the one that wanted to do um other than that was happy because was talking to friend from school and we're just trying little bit probably gonna make plans to hang out over break and talked to few of my other friends that haven't heard from in while and heard from another friend at school that they got the christmas present from me that they really liked it so was pretty happy about that because was little worried because um don't do christmas presents with my friends so i'm super happy that she enjoyed what got her um and i'm on the lookout for package from her not quite sure when i'll get it though but pretty excited for christmas ended up staying up little bit too late just we had lot going on um which will make setting everything up slightly harder but did lot of it last night so that should definitely help out so hopefully won't have to stay up too late tonight because know that my little sisters will wanna get up early in the morning to see if santa come and everything today was fun woke up pretty early um 'cause it was christmas um and spent the holiday with family my parents were happy about the gifts got them which made me happy and my aunt [inaudible] were also happy about the gifts got for them so was really pleased because like getting gifts for people even though they said not to get them gifts figured that the stuff got they wouldn't like [and buy me] so in the end it looks like they did so i've been really happy [even] because got quite de few things asked for as well um especially book that i've been wanting to read um so that super cool because i'm getting to read that and tomorrow have pretty long day planned just waking up early to get home to play game with my cousins and my siblings which should last the majority of the day and then can see if earlier in the week might try to make plans with some friends or [whoever] we've gotten some of the allocations that are gonna be due coming up in january and need something [inaudible] so have few things to work on but also still have plenty of time to relax today was fine um we were supposed to meet woke up late um but we still went and met them anyway it was just later then intended and we spent the entire day playing dungeons and dragons campaign um which it was our first time ever playing except four of my cousins who had played before and it was pretty fun and it took literally the entire day um there was little bit of conflict just because some people didn't get along super well and other people were just causing controversy and not really focusing on the game so it took even longer um i'm sure we would all play again in the future and it will be fine but i'm also not super pumped about it because there too like overall there were too many people and it was too chaotic for me and there this [inaudible] really start feeling left out and when there that many people involved um so kinda had hard time and had [inaudible] but destressed by doing my laundry doing some art and watching my favorite films um and was little pissed off about my laundry because nail polish got on some of my clothes and haven't been able to get it out but can keep on trying so hopefully i'll figure out some solution so that don't have to get rid of those clothes and then tomorrow i'm supposed to get up very early to go to the dentist which i'm not thrilled about but it should be okay today was fine had to go to the dentist which went about just as well as expected it to which was not so great 'cause just have really bad teeth um i'm trying though to take care of them brush [inaudible] lot and [inaudible] flossing though [inaudible] it has to do with having small mouth according to my dentist um so i'm gonna have to go back tomorrow and get some more work done and prescribing me special toothpaste stuff like that which is not gonna be fun 'cause it basically gonna take up my entire day and the parts that i'm not actually at the dentist am gonna feel pretty miserable because it'll be rather sore probably swollen mouth and then i'm gonna have to make plans with friend who actually saw tonight but what her plans for sometime later in the week [inaudible] is one of them on friday but honestly don't wanna hang out with any of them but guess might as well just do it and get it over with and hopefully can find some time to myself [inaudible] because [inaudible] big family so it hard to get any alone time ever especially since my sister birthday coming up and trying to see all my cousins before they leave town again today had to wake up to go to dentist and woke up feeling pretty exhausted um but still needed to go to dentist was little bit late but not anything too bad hmm did some work done but it was actually lot less than they first said um so wasn't there for too long but my mouth did swell up whole bunch 'cause just have really sensitive mouth and it super small um so have to go back tomorrow just to get the last few things done hopefully it won't be too bad because after that have to meet with my friends so i'm [preparing to go] to bed and the dentist [inaudible] want to meet with my friends really trying to just [inaudible] of the way [but it] is little bit annoying because [inaudible] my end-of-term group begins today and there still one class that has not put my grade in yet but it is class am pretty confident about so i'm not too worried about it it just would be nice to know my finalized grade so hopefully that will get posted sometime soon today was okay had to go to the dentist and was there for the majority of my day and my mouth really hurt afterwards um 'cause they did some work but then they messed up so they had to redo some of it so was there for longer than expected basically it was just mess and had took lot of medicine to try and make my mouth feel better but basically didn't feel good for the rest of the day and still don't feel well so i'm trying to go to bed little bit earlier um did also meet up with my friends which went just about as expected to which wasn't great because generally they just try and talk [in one of each other] and pretty much sat there in silence um so hopefully won't have to see them again before go back i'll just hang out with some of my other friends like my friend from school who actually like and hopefully that will go better and then went back to work and hoped to close down um um still really didn't feel well and got home pretty late had dinner pretty late and tomorrow is my little sister birthday so i'm having to prepare for that which is generally just lot of stress um 'cause she was not going to [redacted] we have to drop all her presents and do all that and also have to be ready to go to work in the morning again so i'm hoping that i'll wake up and my mouth won't hurt as much anymore today did not go super well the morning started off fine and i've [inaudible] and was happy to be at work doing something that i'm used to and something that is fun um so it it started out just perfectly fine and was pretty happy and was on top of it didn't really eat much though which was probably part of the reason wasn't started not feeling well later in the day and on top of that my mouth was still sore it didn't feel any better since yesterday and that [inaudible] worse so felt really disconnected from all of my family members [inaudible] that so it was nice to [inaudible] with people but was really interested in getting some sleep which is really difficult for me and really makes me feel bad um so ended my day pretty upset which is why [inaudible] just got home planning to go straight to bed instead of staying up um and maybe just taking some time with myself tomorrow because am still pretty upset about it but also don't really feel like discussing it but just whenever try to they don't understand so it not really worth it to keep bringing it up just to be misunderstood and feel like no one cares even don't know more so i'll just try to [inaudible] myself do art or some writing to relax today was fine slept in pretty late woke up not feeling super well because had migraine but also not too bad hmm just took some medicine and it went away and then spent the rest of the day with family which was okay um it turned out better than expected it would be after uh yesterday and the day before um other than that had pretty nice [new year's] party um did talk to quite few of my friends um which was fun and i'm gonna make plans to hang out with some of them pretty soon which should be nice and i'm happy 'cause still have basically month till go back to school um so should have plenty of time to relax and fill out of some of my um study abroad applications and things like that to prepare for next semester um somewhere around spring break so everything going pretty well today slept in really late and then spent part of the day going into town with my sisters and getting some shopping done um which was fun because didn't spend too much and even got some cute stuff and also got to treat my sisters to little snack on the way back home and then and spent the rest of the evening pretty much relaxing [inaudible] my sis my sister and her boyfriend are heading back home tomorrow um it was really nice for me to get my mood back and [my sleep] which i've been trying to work on [inaudible] vacation and my art that wanted to do um so it was all pretty nice on the downside there lot of tension between my mom and dad right now which makes everything really rough uh tomorrow have to get up very early to [do my studying] and [inaudible] but i'm trying to [inaudible] super great [inaudible] makes me [inaudible] and gives me headache so that not gonna be very much fun and hopefully i'll be able to get up on time since didn't really go to bed as early as should have today was fine and did begin pretty early um but today it was because had to go to the dentist again they did lot of work and [inaudible] mouth they even scratched my face at one point but um in the end it wasn't too too bad it was okay and on the plus side hopefully won't have to go back for bit although they did tell me that have to get my wisdom teeth out which is also not gonna be very much fun and also have to make doctor appointment because have to do everything that can um while i'm home since don't have dental and stuff back at campus although do have medical but still i'm gonna try and get as much done as possible um it gonna be fun um kind of on the plus side my sister and her boyfriend left today so get my room back i'm also sad that my sister leaving but also the combination of her and her boyfriend is pretty obnoxious and have been wishing that next christmas she would just come back by herself but really doubt that it gonna happen uh because it looks like they're gonna give me read and all so we'll just have to see um but mean can put up with him because he makes her happy other than that i'm little getting slightly worried just because it so close to school starting back up and hadn't realized um that have so few days left here at home um and still have quite few things to do but it shouldn't be too bad mean have time to get them done really just have to finish my study abroad applications my freshman summer applications need to respond to few other things and um then the rest of it is really just self improvement that want to [inaudible] going to the gym more which my brother is helping me with and eating healthier which i'm trying to do on my own and practicing violin working on my art things like that um so will have plenty of time in this last few days at home to work on some of that stuff today was fine woke up little bit too late but um so was supposed to go to work this morning but it still wasn't bad um but did get to work and stayed there for basically the whole day spent some of the evening hanging out with friend that haven't seen since got home and spent the rest of the evening at home with my family um watching film which is why probably stayed up later than should have 'cause have to get up and go back to work tomorrow morning um but mean i'm sure that i'll get up [inaudible] and it will be fine my other thing is um my tooth has been hurting so had to go to the dentist the other day and also have to [go to] chiropractor 'cause i'm very sore but [hopefully] get to do that as well tomorrow um my sister is leaving on saturday so i'm probably pretty busy until then but do have sundays and mondays off so that'll help little bit today was fine basically once again all did was wake up and go to work um which however i'm pleased [inaudible] which is little bit stressful but could [inaudible] and everything okay but wasn't feeling super well 'cause still have to go to the chiropractor and it been like months now um so hopefully might go tomorrow mean hopefully at least if not tomorrow it will be sometime this week because desperately need to go i'm starting to get headaches and double vision since haven't been so long um so know that once am able to go and do that i'll start feeling lot better and um other than that have few errands need to run that haven't been able to do since i've been at work every day basically um and don't know when i'll get those done if wake up on time tomorrow can go in even earlier for work and maybe get some shopping done so i'm gonna try and do that but i've been really tired i'm staying up too late um my my [little] sister wanted to spend time um but hopefully i'll be able to take it up in the morning on time and go in today it was all right spent the day at work um and woke up this morning really not feeling well so drank lot of tea and took some medicine to try and make myself feel better um but one of our workers um ended up not being able to come in so we had to call on her [inaudible] and the [police] isn't exactly hopeful so that was pretty stressful because we had to do more work to make up for it and the other people that were on the shift weren't exactly weren't oriented either and so [redacted] he really [toughed] the shift because we did get quite busy um but we were able to handle it was little bit annoyed then went to the chiropractor today so i'll probably be sore um tomorrow but after that should feel lot better 'cause i'm always bit sore right after an adjustment before the soreness goes away um and hopefully drinking this herbal tea stuff that my cousin recommended will stop my sore throat um 'cause really don't want to have to go to the doctor while i'm here and tomorrow my older my other older sister is going back to school um so will be the only one left now since get to stay so late which is nice but also means i'll have more stuff to do on top of the schoolwork that already need to be doing and haven't really started but now [inaudible] sundays and mondays should be freed up little bit more so that can hopefully get stuff done then today was fine it was basically the same as every other day um got up and went to work which did wake up little bit earlier today um again work was super duper busy so that was what spent my whole day doing um but it was good mean we handled it was also excited because we got to make some really good cheese um that love and that also super fun to make and got to do it so was excited about that um had quite few customers and after work got to um see my grandmother which was also really nice since haven't seen her in while um only the only real downside of the day was that my other older sister left um because she had to go back to school already and i'm kinda sad 'cause we didn't get to spend too much time with her um since her break was lot shorter than mine but um i'm so glad that did get to see her and hopefully i'll get to see her again in april if not in april then most likely at least get to see her for little bit over the summertime so we'll just see what happens today had lazy day at home um so got to sleep in really late and spent most of the day just relaxing with my family which is really lovely we're doing harry potter marathon um so we can [inaudible] that that was fun and um should've worked on some things but didn't really get anything done and was planning on working on stuff tomorrow but it turns out i'll actually have to be in town all day with my mom might try and take my laptop though so can still do few things in the car 'cause we'll be going out of town to do some shopping for the restaurant um but hopefully that should be fun mean i'm not really sure but should be okay i'm just kind of upset 'cause that means have to get up pretty early and hadn't planned on it especially since i'm going to bed so late since didn't find find out until just minute ago but it should still be fine so we'll just see how it goes today woke up early which was on time because had plans with my mom this morning um but we didn't end up getting to them until way later than expected so spent the majority of the day with my grandmother and one of my cousins um but it turned out to be lot better than expected um really 'cause don't get to talk to my cousin recently she much younger than am and whenever we get together she doesn't talk to me 'cause i'm bit older and she hangs out with the kids um so it was really interesting today 'cause went to speak to her lot and my uncle stopped by her dad so went to see him as well and he my godfather so it was really nice and he wanted to make plans to meet up before go back to school um 'cause he has some stuff he wants to discuss with me and book that he got me for christmas was waiting uh for it to come into the bookstore so i'm gonna make plans with him soon hopefully um other than that spent the rest of the day with my mom we had to go to town to get some shopping done um which turned out fine we were kind of quite while but it wasn't too bad traffic was just little bit heavy um but was pretty happy because made plans with well somewhat planned with someone for when get back to school and made plans with friend for tomorrow morning to get breakfast um who also from out of state um so it would be nice to hang out with him again 'cause haven't seen him in like few weeks um and then after that i'll just spend the day at work and i'm planning on taking my sketchbook and some other stuff and book to read um so that hopefully the time will speed up when don't have any customers can keep busy and actually feel productive instead of just sitting down like have been doing for the last few days today was okay um woke up later than wanted to and was pretty exhausted had plans with friend to go to breakfast so definitely had to get up um but they ended up canceling the last minute but it was already too late 'cause had already gone into town um so in struggling to get with them just went into work to try and come home early um and then got lot of stuff done there still felt like wasn't really getting enough stuff uh prepared to go back to school feel like i'm not ready to start again large part of it is going back and seeing some of my friends 'cause they're not exactly the best um but there are few people i'm excited to see and i'm trying to give myself more scet set plan and schedule next semester so that make sure to do things like work out and um work for my job little bit more than had last semester um and go to the dining hall more and things like that and stay on top of my homework um so hopefully it'll be okay i'm glad that still have uh quite bit of break left because definitely need the time off um to try and get my head on straight and i'm planning on talking to my counselor again once start going back to school today was all right um woke up too late to go in early with my mom because wasn't feeling well and then there was lot to be done [inaudible] um so did all of that worked all day and got into fight with my with my sister um over financial stuff and other things and almost ended up changing my ticket back to early but knew my mom and my other little sister would be really upset if did that so didn't um [inaudible] just stayed at the restaurant all day long and worked and didn't even have time to work on stuff for school but um should be able to stay home at least friday or saturday mainly and then also have sunday and monday to work on it um because tomorrow i'm gonna get up in time to go into town with my mom and then have plans with friend later on that haven't seen since got home so hopefully that will be fun today woke up on time um it took me longer than wanted it to to get ready um but was still on time so that was good went to town early so got to get some shopping done that really wanted to do which was really nice um and then at work the morning shift turned out pretty busy but it was okay 'cause we basically had enough help and then got to leave work early to go hang out with um some high school friends one of them hadn't seen and was leaving [redacted] tomorrow um and had an okay time with them it wasn't quite everything wanted it to be but it was still pretty good was glad got to see them before they left before left and i'm really considering um making plans with one of my other friends that had seen once since got back home um to try and see her again before have to go back to school but i'm trying to decide because sometimes hanging out with her can be more frustrating than it is fun um but i'm also don't have too much time left so have to make plans with people pretty soon before head back to school today woke up little bit later but still got to work as usual um and work was super busy um it got busier than expected so had to get some extra help um and that was basically had been there all day and the rush we got was at the nighttime so was basically on my feet for good three hours without being able to take break so i'm definitely sore i'm having some back issues but not anything too super bad so hopefully by tomorrow i'll feel little bit better because we have catering job that have to prepare for um also [inaudible] just one of the other employees [inaudible] early now [inaudible] calling to [let me know] am such hard worker um which made me feel good and [so] definitely talk to them more [inaudible] usual and it kind of nice to talk to some regular customers um my uncle stopped by [just tried] to see him for bit um so overall it was productive day even got some of the schoolwork done had been meaning to work on should book another [inaudible] tomorrow and have i'm staying home for the [friday] and sunday so it should be nice work was super busy again today um so ended up being super tired 'cause we stayed later than we had been um and we just had more customers and more rushes than normal um which wouldn't have been bad except for the fact that really needed to get some of my writing done for some applications so i'll have to try and work on that tomorrow and the next day [inaudible] since didn't have time to do it at work um and didn't really get to take break so i'm currently sore and not feeling well and was super sleepy basically day long um and when got home should've just gone to bed but my little sister wanted to stay up so ended up staying up way too late watching show um which really just made me feel worse so i'm gonna sleep in tomorrow and hopefully that will make me feel better today was having lazy day at home intended to get some of my stuff done but didn't the only thing did accomplish was laundry um which did still make me feel pretty good other than that didn't do anything all day long really um [inaudible] 'cause tomorrow i'm gonna have to go to dallas i'm just gonna [inaudible] i'll try and to write my um some more applications 'cause the-they're due in just about two days believe um so really really have to get them done really just have not been in the right mindset to do any work was supposed to go [inaudible] today which hoped woulda helped but they cancelled on me last minute um which kinda just made me feel worse um hopefully tomorrow will be better and guess even if do end up going to dallas on the way can still work on my some of my applications um and hopefully get some [inaudible] um there are lot want to apply to but definitely need to cut it down anyway and only apply to couple and then have few other school things need to do 'cause go back in week which i'm excited about and stressed about today was basically just another lazy day at home um slept in 'cause didn't feel too great so took some medicine for migraine and [inaudible] rest of my day is just [inaudible] relaxing um accepted my place in the kangaroo dance thing um which should be lot of fun for when go back to school but it'll also be really big time commitment and also looked into doing sorority type thing as well and some of the classes i'm gonna be taking but couldn't really find the motivation to write my freshman summer applications which are due tomorrow by noon um have worked on few though so should just submit those which won't be as many as wanted to submit but even if don't get into one can just take another class shouldn't be an issue um and tomorrow we will probably have work unless the weather is too bad so guess we'll see 'cause if we don't have work then will definitely have more time to do some of my seminars in the morning as long as actually wake up which is debatable as to whether or not will just stayed at home all day today um instead of going into work because slept in late because my [inaudible] kept me up for good portion of the evening um and then kept waking up in the middle of the night because i'm not feeling too well so did just end up staying home and it was pretty nice to have day off but my [sooners] were due at 1200 and woke up because didn't do them because forgot that the time zone over there is an hour ahead of here um so should've turned them in an hour before had planned to um which was completely my fault so had some of them written and ready but it should be fine can just take normal class or if there are spots left for some [sooners] you can email professors sometimes to get in so might be able to try that as well and my [inaudible] advisor emailed me today so i'll have to try and get back to him tomorrow and also need to start um financial aid stuff and um summer and spring break programs [start] tomorrow um which hopefully i'll be able to do even though i'll be going into work in the morning and also hope that can get little bit of shopping done but don't know that my mom necessarily wants me to so i'll just have to see because i'll ha am going back to school in just few days feel like am ready for it but not really ready for it today slept in little bit later than intended so went in-into town later as well which was due to me just not feeling super well um and then spent the day at work which weren't super busy so when wasn't working did few things for school and also played some games um and then after work had to go to the dentist which was fine um it was actually quick this time and this is the last time i'll have to go before i'm back campus in just few days um my roommate was [inaudible] along today which is cool because it kind of made me more excited to go back um and was super happy because got an email from the departments about how well did in class um basically asking if was further interested in studying that subject so i'm super pumped about that because it is something i'm interested in so i'll probably meet with them when get back to campus as well today woke up on time which was pretty early this morning went and got to do some shopping um got to choose my own [inaudible] which was really cool because got to get lot of stuff that wanted and needed um to go back um to school this semester i'm also pretty excited 'cause think finally decided um which study abroad programs i'm going to apply to and know there so much stuff need to get done and have some solid plans for going back um just can't believe that only have few days left in my hometown [inaudible] sort of [inaudible] wanna come back here for spring break but also worry that if come back here too much that i'm just gonna wanna stay so think i'm gonna try and [inaudible] spring break [inaudible] somewhere else and then kinda just come back here for summer and i'll have whole another month or so off depending on whether or not can [inaudible] study abroad programs i'm definitely gonna miss my family lot and i'm hoping that the stress of this semester doesn't get as bad as it did the last semester because should be little bit more prepared and [inaudible] this whole idea of how to handle it but things [inaudible] frustrating like they did the last semester um so hopefully [they] will get better today was another normal day um went to work but before that went to um to have facial done as birthday present um which was really nice it was super relaxing um and was glad that started monday out on positive note like that um after that did come in to work and we were fairly busy but the employees mostly handled it so was able to get some schoolwork done which was awesome because have quite few things that have due dates that are coming up um and tomorrow i'm hoping to get more time to finish them because know that when get back to campus it'll be really busy but i'm not sure if it'll happen because have to do lot of shopping tomorrow um also in preparation of going back to school so i'm going to have to see mean we do have quite few employees coming in so might be able to do that other than that um my family all came by to see me before um [heading] out of state and [inaudible] me like happy birthday wishes so got some gifts and got to see everyone which was pretty nice little bit stressful 'cause they came at time when we were busy at work um but it turned out all right and some of the books got were really awesome and i'm super excited about being able to read them and i'm pretty ready for school to start again now 'cause feel like i've mostly got my classes and my schedule figured out for when get back to campus so it should be okay today was my last day at home um tomorrow i'm heading back to school it was definitely pretty stressful day lot of stuff happened um that wasn't exactly great and [inaudible] to be back at school i'm definitely stressed because didn't really get the chance to prepare and to do everything wanted to do um before heading back so i'm gonna have lot more work tomorrow and definitely lot more luggage than expected which is little bit frustrating um but i'm probably just gonna have to get some friends to help get it back to the dorm which hopefully it will be available and it gonna definitely take while to unpack stayed up later than intended to packing in the first place um but don't know as far as classes and everything feel like it should be all right didn't really get the summer wanted but that okay today got back to school spent basically the entire day traveling which was not fun was really stressed almost missed my flight um luckily they still let me on which was super nice um and other than that had to say goodbye to my family which was really difficult um i'm definitely going to miss them all uh i'm not going to get to see them for while hopefully i'll get to see them in march for spring break and my sister in april if we're [ever at] her school we'll just have to see um quite few things are starting this week have my first class tomorrow at 830 in the morning which is definitely gonna be little difficult 'cause really stayed up too late tonight packing and getting getting some other stuff done um and there are stuff programs that need to apply to so i'm [definitely] gonna have to work on that tomorrow 'cause the deadline coming up since should've finished that at home didn't have time to was gonna work on some stuff on the plane but then some thoughts have happened wasn't able to um basically it was really stressful day and just really hope that my classes go well i'm meeting my academic adviser later in the week so hopefully he can help me out um with everything and hope that can also get [inaudible] into more set routine going to bed on time getting up on time doing my homework quickly starting yoga and seeing some friends and joining [clubs] that i'm interested in because feel like doing those things and being more social will make me have much better semester overall today had my first real day of classes so had to get up little bit early but that really wasn't too bad um managed to do it and made it to class on time and that class should go about how expected it to um which is not gonna be super well unless put in quite bit of work which i'm definitely gonna try to do i'm gonna try and time-manage my semester found really great spot to study um that think i'm gonna start taking advantage of because think it will definitely help me focus and will help me to get out of the room more um also signed up for sorority-type event um that had to pretty much force myself to do 'cause it will make me socialize lot more but i'm really looking forward to it and i'm still debating doing the other sororities as well um because do wanna get lot more involved um i'm pretty excited because i'm shopping two classes although think i'm pretty set on which one i'm planning on taking although will figure it out with my academic advisor on wednesday um and also on wednesday have pta meeting which will be nice although i'm probably not prepared but am planning on starting to work it out and get set schedule down which should help with that and also have my first um dance practice which is super exciting 'cause believe that will give me nice community of people to work with um since we'll all be dancing together and being in show together so hopefully everything gonna look up today got to couple of other classes went shopping and it looks like it'll be um fun but also lot of hard work and had to get quite few textbooks for it uh so had to enter lottery for it so hopefully will in fact get in um because i've already gotten the books and i'm really looking forward to taking it so if don't i'm gonna have to try and find different class to be in um and am going to meet with an academic advisor tomorrow so that should help little bit um basically my schedule is super busy because have some applications due in two days tomorrow i've got four different appointments and an event to go to all evening so i'll definitely have to try and finish my homework for thursday sooner um and then need to do my homework for friday because on thursday will be super busy once again and thursday is when my applications are due um so i'm gonna have to get all of that done [over] short time period um where don't have lot of time to myself so may have to try and find an alternative study space to work on essays and things but i'm looking forward to doing these events because feel like it'll make me more social and i'll just have to plan my time accordingly so it'll be okay today was really fun got to um not have any classes so instead just had bunch of meetings with um professors um to talk about my future in both classics in neuroscience which was interesting um because i'm still not really sure what wanna do but think that it at least helped little bit um and then also [inaudible] and we discussed um plans for the summer which didn't really have um the applications done for and they're due tomorrow so that not exactly great but i'm planning on getting up early tomorrow morning and just focusing and really working on them because have events um tomorrow evening and then i'll be fairly busy on friday as well um have homework that need to get completed for friday so i'm gonna have to try and do all of that thursday morning um but hopefully it won't be too bad and then [inaudible] going into this weekend it looks like i'll be pretty busy with um some extracurricular activities tonight had my first dance group appointment um and it was lot of fun but also still [inaudible] is pretty big time commitment which is gonna make my classes little bit more difficult but think if just focus on finding good support systems both with friends and with professors then the next semester will turn out okay um was disappointed because didn't get into my classes really wanted to get into but you know it might be okay because i'm taking another really fun class with good friend um so hopefully that will be awesome today was pretty busy um had friend in class and it was fun um especially 'cause have the class with my friends so we all got to be there together um ran into someone haven't seen in while that i've [inaudible] but didn't actually talk to him so maybe i'll try and get that next time because didn't get my confidence up little bit today um because managed to make myself go to an event um and plan on continuing to do that have another event tomorrow night and feel like it definitely helping me become little bit more social and outgoing it'll help me make some new friends and it just helping my overall happiness overall to be doing things instead of staying in the room the whole time especially 'cause i'm still able to stay on top of my schoolwork while doing it finished some applications tonight and i've got two more that will get start go through other opportunities that i'm looking forward to so it should be really good i'm gonna meet with my counselor next week and think that she will definitely be proud of me for the work that i've been doing um so hopefully this semester is already going better than last semester would just have to take that class [inaudible] 'cause am gonna struggle in two of them today was fine only had one class and met someone really nice in it so was pretty happy about that because used to work with him which was fine um other than that had to go to work today but it was okay plus got to talk to my sister on the phone for like two hours and hadn't talked to her for like weeks um so that was really nice as well and then [inaudible] spent some time [relaxing] in my room i'm super happy 'cause got um new computer in the mail that had been looking forward to and i'm still trying to set it up so hopefully i'll have little more luck tomorrow or something but it seems super nice so it should be fine i'm probably gonna call them and see how to set up [inaudible] with some actual professionals um and then this evening we had some friends over for little pizza party which was lot of fun 'cause they're both super nice and had another sorority event to go to but that was also all right because had really good time um at it and ran into someone that knew um which was super cool because didn't realize that she was also doing the sorority stuff um so hopefully that will help have another big sorority event tomorrow that will basically last the majority of my morning so i'm gonna take some homework to work on so hopefully can still get stuff done while also figuring out if want to join those sororities and the weekend think it'll be super busy and have quite bit of work to do as well so yeah i'm just trying to balance everything out today was fun um recently had social event on morning [inaudible] so got up pretty early to get ready for that um and still had time to breakfast and everything get prepared and went met lot of really cool people that was really glad got the chance to talk to and got to so see some other people that um know from other events which was awesome 'cause didn't know that they were also involved um so that took the majority of my morning um also got very last-minute email for one of my classes about some of our work requirements for monday which was definitely stressful 'cause already have busy weekend and have to add some extra work on top of that um so had to go running around looking for book at the very last minute um and luckily they had one left in stock so managed to get that for my class hmm and then other than that um spent the day trying to set up my new computer and get it fully working which am super pumped about so hopefully it'll be more operational tomorrow and i'm gonna get up bit early again because have gotta get bunch of homework done and then have my social event in the evening to go to um that will take uh quite bit of time but should still have time to do little bit more homework after this so gotta get ready for the week today was not exactly great um had fun going to the event that had today but i'm already struggling with my schoolwork and it barely the first week of classes um so went ahead and signed up for tutor and have meeting with my therapist on tuesday so think i'm just gonna have to be really straightforward don't know if i'm depressed or just have really bad anxiety about my work but it not going well and feel like i'm falling behind in my last semester my grades weren't great and mean to me i'm just at the point of considering taking year off which definitely don't want to do but feel like might have to do because don't really know what other options have um and even thinking about it just is upsetting me 'cause feel like i'm behind everyone else here um [inaudible] lot of people feel like that but i'm feeling for me it true in the stem department know in humanities i'm generally okay but think my prior stem education was lacking um but think talking to my therapist will help and she'll probably provide me with other resources so it hard for me to really talk to people because i'm embarrassed about what don't know but feel like just have to bite the bullet if want the semester to go any better than last semester and do 'cause wanna be less stressed yeah and on top of everything so need to get to point where can do that and function today was okay um woke up on time and managed to get little bit of my homework done that didn't [done] last night then had all my classes um but had to go to one for the first time that was actually super interesting and i'm really glad i'm taking it i'm little frustrated 'cause think it will change for another one of my classes that make my schedule little bit more messed up than it was previously um we should be [inaudible] to get worked out and then had pretty busy evening as well um and finished my essay that was due by midnight and did um go to two different meetings and had to miss rehearsal to go to the second meeting um it wasn't the best but [inaudible] anything that can't make up uh so it should be okay and i'm really excited because have my [inaudible] sorority stuff and now just have to wait for bit which will be wednesday morning really hope we can get one 'cause i'm super pumped about it and i've met so many nice people um but i'm just really looking forward to doing it uh tomorrow is gonna be definitely busy should have done little bit more reading but [inaudible] already few times so hopefully [inaudible] enough um and on top of that i'm meeting with my counselor tomorrow and already have quite few things that wanna talk to her about uh so hopefully that meeting will be productive today was pretty good um had uh quite few classes but they were pretty interesting was little sleepy 'cause ended up not being able to fall asleep for while last night even after tried to go to bed um it okay 'cause still managed to stay awake during my classes and then after classes were over went to have [inaudible] with my counselor um which was really nice um because haven't seen her since i've been back so talking to her was great and then um really was able to focus and got my homework done and felt okay about it not great but have applied for tutor and plan to go to office hours once they start up um so that should definitely help and um since finished my homework pretty early also got to finish an application that wanted to do and still had time to watch show um so it was nice way to end the evening do have to get up super early tomorrow but it for an exciting reason 'cause it bid day um it the reason go to bed so i'll [inaudible] go join one which am super pumped about can't wait to see lot of people know so it exciting today was exciting because i've had to get up early um to go out and find out which sorority was gonna be part of um so joined and got the [approved] list with um all the other girls that joined in the [inaudible] which is super cool especially because already knew few of the other members and [inaudible] some of the other girls who got into to the same sorority um so that was exciting because i'll have friend in that and i'm really looking forward to doing all the events that are fun and hopefully really good way for me to get more involved um [totally fun way] to have some other friends um going down [inaudible] with one of my other extra good friends from [inaudible] but i'm gonna try and get it worked out so hopefully it will be okay um only had one class today which was nice because had to get up super early um so was really tired so had originally planned [to work] but being extremely tired paired with not feeling well resulted in me taking nap instead so i'll just go and do the work on saturday which won't be nearly as fun but i've got to do it because i'm trying to be captain um and i'm little bit stressed because have test keep forgetting about tomorrow night that i'm not prepared for and stayed up way too late just had um something extracurricular tonight that took up all the time and i'm [inaudible] homework and had stress with my blocking group stuff that resulted in me also being distracted from my homework to try and deal with that for while so hopefully tomorrow will be better even though it pretty busy day today went really well um had my one of my classes for the second time today um think it was nice because we had we have group assignment for the weekend and um i'm fairly excited about [inaudible] [about] to work with so also sort of made another friend in the class um this other guy that was in one of my classes last semester um it just really cool to have have person know um other than that only had one other class it was super fun and had to meet professor which was little late too um because [messed up] my [inaudible] [falling out] um so ended up meeting with her pretty late but it was okay 'cause ran into another girl that knew um and then when was done still had time to study for my exam tonight which went ok probably could have studied for little bit more but don't think did too badly um and then even got to get dinner with friend um before the exam someone i'm blocking with so it was really good to hang out with him other than that tomorrow shouldn't be too busy but do have lab which is quite long and i'm debating whether or not to try and um take some time to go to work tomorrow because do have little gap of time in the middle of the day but could also use it to do some homework um because might be going out tomorrow night i'm not really sure yet um and on saturday have plans with another guy but also have to do my group project saturday and go to work on saturday so we'll see how it all works out today was pretty good only had two classes but one of them was lab so it took quite bit of time um and made plans to hang out with someone tomorrow which was nice but at the same time also have to do group project which i'm not as excited about um but i'll get it all done also have to go to work tomorrow but it should be ok because have it all planned out so that can do everything wanna do so guess i'll get up on time in the morning probably gonna have to get coffee or something 'cause i'm going to bed so late but it was worth it 'cause tonight went out to party and had really good time with the the girls from [redacted] think made really good friend or two um and i'm really looking forward to future events with all of them hanging out partying doing stuff so i'm just really grateful that get to be part of such wonderful community and mean wasn't sure that i'd get in and did so i'm really excited about it today was pretty good had to wake up pretty early to group project and that was just on time for that um which was nice and i'm glad about the group that i'm working with because everyone sweet and everyone on top of it so we can get work done um it also more than expected so was gonna have [inaudible] and then went to my job for few hours which was nice 'cause [inaudible] extra so [inaudible] extra next week um and then other than that had date this evening which was all right [inaudible] think have feelings for him like that and he obviously has feelings for me um so i'm not exactly sure how i'm gonna handle it but as for the evening hanging out with few more of my friends [inaudible] which made me feel lot better about it um [inaudible] if [inaudible] getting home [inaudible] you know um and join my friends but should be able to get some time tomorrow and try and get up um fairly early um 'cause [inaudible] five and like three assignments to monday and two assignments to tuesday or three assignments to tuesday so have quite bit to do uh but it shouldn't be too bad as long as get up and actually focus and get it done um so hopefully will stick to that today was all right um was little bit um frustrated about this guy i've been talking to but hopefully i'll be able to handle it 'cause um over the next few days 'cause don't really wanna spend too much time worrying about it um i've got lot of homework to do today and got [errands] to be done and still need to catch up on some readings um may have some time today or tomorrow but also have to be home to do group project tomorrow because my group couldn't meet up today um but was also glad because got to spend some time with friends we actually went out to dinner which was nice um it really was kind of worth it and this week is looking like it'll be pretty busy i've got quiz tomorrow not tomorrow tuesday and class i'm gonna have to get ready for so hopefully i'll get everything done in timely fashion so have time to study and go to bed at reasonable hour instead of super late like have been doing i'm going to dance practice tomorrow night which i'm not necessarily looking forward to maybe because i'm pretty tired and sore and haven't had time to practice i'm pretty sure it'll still be okay [inaudible] because we only have four more practices until our show but i'll just have to try and find some free time to work on the dances on my own today was all right i'm not feeling too well and i'm full of worry and getting sick so i'm getting sore throat which isn't gonna be good because have my dance performance coming up and quite few events um to my other extracurriculars and i'm also super busy with schoolwork have possibly two courses tomorrow and lot of reading that i'm behind on um but we-wednesday at least is my slow day so hopefully can just go to class and work and take some time to relax since i'm not feeling super well but will also have to go to work um i'm really hoping that don't have strep or the flu 'cause that what it feeling like but hopefully um will just take some emergency and start feeling better and trying to sleep lot we'll see today went pretty well um was pretty prepared for class in section which had been worried about but it turned out all right it was really nice to see my crew members in class and just [inaudible] having [inaudible] always makes it easier um [inaudible] do an assignment that i'm super excited about that i'm gonna have to finish tomorrow 'cause was planning on starting today but never did which is definitely not gonna be fun 'cause it an assignment that [inaudible] come easily to me hopefully it won't take too long 'cause only have one class tomorrow but really need to go to work and need to practice for dance and go to actual dance practice um and then on tuesday have few things to do on friday have some things to do have quite few things leading into this weekend i'm prepared for having uh stress because [inaudible] dance performance it also coming up and definitely haven't practiced enough so really need to be on [inaudible] and have three practices left um and [inaudible] all right had to [clear] the [inaudible] super prepared for but think [this] will turn out okayish um and [inaudible] my sections today actually am waiting for [inaudible] so [inaudible] my therapist is going to be pleased and [inaudible] generally don't speak um and got lot of time to talk to my mom and it felt like [inaudible] things sometimes which was really nice and relaxing and also managed to do my laundry and clean up little bit which always makes me feel better today was all right woke up earlier than needed to and was exhausted since went to bed so late so got to go back to sleep which was really nice and class went fairly well did get grade back that wasn't too great but should be able to make it up no problem which will be really nice um other than that was really busy went to work um which was good [so that's] out of the way so don't have to worry about it on saturday and have dance practice tonight which took up quite bit of time which was difficult 'cause had an assignment up that i'd been working on that i'm [inaudible] due tomorrow morning so i'm having to stay up late again to work on that but hopefully all my assignments i'll be doing friday won't be too difficult so can actually get them done and go to bed early 'cause am exhausted and might be going out with friends uh friday night and saturday which will be really nice but i'm still debating whether or not should stay and do some homework rather than that um but could [inaudible] trying to do homework saturday morning and then have [inaudible] sunday so might stay [inaudible] but will see do have shopping to get few things so we'll see today went fairly well and was exhausted 'cause stayed up way too late last night um 'cause was busy and on top of that just wasn't feeling well in general which sucks um but class was really nice at least and got lunch and dinner with the same friend and made some plans for this weekend and for next week so i'll be pretty busy but am also looking forward to it i'm debating going out with friends tomorrow night might just stay in since haven't been feeling well and need to do quite bit of homework so guess we'll just have to see whatever happens um and other than that um everything been going okay i'm just considering going to the doctor and i'm little stressed because of some stuff going on with my family back home but there not too much can do about it other than offer support and talk to them um so hopefully they'll all work it out um so today was okay had sort of rough night last night um so today wasn't feeling super great and sort of spent the day not doing anything um which really wasn't good because i've i'm planning on going out with friend tomorrow to get some errands done and also have quite bit of homework um and just have one class that watching lot of films and really reading heavy um but if really focused more should be able to get everything done no problem um 'cause it not too difficult just time-consuming um and um it should be okay if just get up early and get little bit done before leave with my friend to go shopping and then whenever come back then can finish the rest and i'm meeting with someone to go over uh one of my psats so that'll definitely help as well um 'cause that'll ensure that it gets done on time and everything um so that'll be nice today was all right um got all my work done although i'm just little bit behind on things because didn't really do anything yesterday and should have especially 'cause tomorrow have an extremely busy day so don't know if i'll have any time um to really do homework which is bad 'cause have pretty big assignment due tuesday and lot of reading have to do for another class on on tuesday um so overall i've been pretty busy plus i'm not feeling super well um which isn't good because have so many things to get done and do hope that start feeling better before thursday because have um big party to just to go to with all my friends to one of my friend birthdays um so really want to be in good place to have good time so would have to try and get all of my other stuff done ahead of time hopefully can do it but on wednesday [inaudible] only have one class and work that [inaudible] doing some work until friday or saturday so that have little extra time it disappointing because needed to go shopping today so [inaudible] plans um so probably won't go shopping [inaudible] this party and if do it'll have to be briefly [inaudible] [21] store in the area which [sucks] and not too much [inaudible] on it because have quite few [inaudible] so hopefully i'll still be able to find something and hopefully everything will turn out all right in the end especially with the party today has not been going well stayed up way too late last night because of my roommate um and had really busy day today so didn't get done lot of the things that wanted to get done um which resulted in me staying [up lot] later because also had extracurriculars had to go to um and even when came back my roommate was distracting me and [inaudible] so was basically unable to finish my homework so i'm still awake trying to finish an assignment that due at 1000 am tomorrow do have busy day tomorrow as well um basically i'll be busy until after o'clock so hopefully some time after that can just finish my last bit of homework as did most of it in advance for wednesday and go to bed really early 'cause i'm already feeling sick and i've gotten no sleep for the past three nights uh which isn't good today didn't go too well just really felt sick and tired so ended up sleeping again past two of my classes did go to the afternoon one still feel bad for missing the other two um other than that did have meeting with my therapist and that went really nicely um it was really helpful and we scheduled another one in the future which will be nice um and then had dinner with my um working group tonight which was fun it goes like really long most of the time uh then got back and managed to get all of my work done and [inaudible] to bed early to make up for all the sleep that i've been missing these past few days uh so hopefully tomorrow can either get up early if feel up to it or just on time [inaudible] [constructive] 'cause need to go to work and get few things done and then have dance practice in the evening on thursday if not um plan [inaudible] as well so need to try and finish all my homework for friday early so plan to get everything done tomorrow between like 500 and 800 when have time because have to go to work or i'll just work an hour and then pick up an hour on saturday to make it up so we'll see but hopefully it will be good today was all right i'm still feeling really sick so had to skip dance practice but hopefully i'll be able to make that up have practicing only [inaudible] going to practice on saturday um because my performance is next weekend so have to really kinda be on top of it do kinda regret missing it but feel like if had gone would most likely thrown up so it better overall that didn't go um and hopefully i'll be feeling lot better at the night of the performance also really need to try and [inaudible] in preparation for my [inaudible] um but keep forgetting to make an appointment am not sure when would have the free time to do that so [inaudible] can do little bit more i'm excited for tomorrow uh 'cause i'm going to um some friend party and celebrate my friend birthday so it should be lot of fun got to do lot of shopping today [inaudible] dress but [inaudible] stuff [inaudible] so it pretty flattering and something style don't know really well [inaudible] feeling little bit more confident about it and um i've already got some of my homework done for friday so i'll just have to finish it little bit [inaudible] tomorrow and i'll be all set and not have to stress the only thing is that do have to get up early on friday for class and will have to [inaudible] party more so than usual but that will be really awesome and i'm also really happy today 'cause got box in the mail from my mom on tuesday and got to talk to her on the phone for little bit which was really nice 'cause know she been having hard time and i've kind of been having hard time which was [inaudible] to speak with her it was super refreshing and um then friend even came over to my room later which was also really nice um it someone that i'm gonna be blocking with so like hanging out spending time with him tonight was pretty nice went to party with some of my really close friends and had pretty good time although was kind of sad because someone invited didn't end up showing up and really wish that they had but on the plus side um one of the guys in my [art] class um talked to me and i'm pretty sure he super into me which is really nice to know um because haven't had someone that had crush on me in while and so it exciting and hopefully i'll get to have lunch with him or something like that some time 'cause [inaudible] before but i'm busy so hopefully he'll ask me again 'cause otherwise i'll have to [ring] him and don't really want to hmm but other than that i'm little stressed because have some homework due tomorrow that haven't quite finished don't really know if i'm gonna finish it but it shouldn't be too bad 'cause it only one assignment and i've gotten all of the other work for that class done so it should be okay and hopefully i'll get up when need to get up at o'clock which is what i'm setting my alarm for um so that should be all right at least but we'll just have to see how it goes in the morning 'cause hopefully i'll get all my lab work done and um go to math which even if just go to turn in my homework it should be okay because pretty much know what we're doing in math but we'll see today was all right um got really sick so didn't go to any of my classes um so just spent the day doing homework and he relaxing in my dorm and then the night time spent with friends partying um and wasn't planning on drinking but did end up drinking so now feel more sick than did but hopefully tomorrow it will be okay 'cause need to go to work and also have dance practice and quite bit of homework that need to get done um so hopefully can do it all by the deadline 'cause have something due at noon and on at 500 on sunday and then everything else is due on tuesday um so i'm really glad that we have monday off even though have some extra dance practices to get to but hopefully tomorrow i'll have all the [inaudible] time to rehearse on my own perform on practice we'll just have to see how the day uh works out especially 'cause i've gotta go to work and don't really want to 'cause i'm not really feeling well but hopefully it will be okay 'cause only have to work for like two hours and can get back to whatever else today was all right still haven't been feeling well [i took] my medicine but it didn't really help um had to go to work um uh which really made me just feel lot worse than had before and other than that had um dance practice which was okay um i'm just yeah looking forward to the show but i'm also nervous about it because need to practice and i'm also super busy um which makes it more difficult um and just my homework is really getting the best of me because haven't been feeling well which makes it hard to focus have so many assignments coming up but hopefully we can get on top of them tomorrow tried to stay up tonight to do them but it just seems like really can't focus or get anything done [inaudible] so think i'll i'll just go to bed and i'll [inaudible] try [inaudible] reasonable time um but i'm not sure that i'll even be able to focus then and may not get all of my assignments turned in which sucks [inaudible] today wasn't super great um didn't get to bed until late last night um so woke up late and didn't completely finish all my homework but did get it done it all done um but felt really sick worse than have been feeling so ended up taking quite long nap um and didn't feel much better when woke up which definitely sucked but um i'll just yeah how it happens sometimes i've got super busy day tomorrow as well have quite bit of homework that i'm gonna have to catch up on so hopefully won't be feeling as bad and if do still not feel super great i'll probably try and um go to [hohs] some time but don't know fully that i'll have time to tomorrow 'cause i've i've gotta get up and do homework in the morning then i've got meetings dance practice and other extracurricular event so it definitely gonna be super busy and dance practice in particular is gonna be hard um since i've been feeling sick but have got to go [over it] so i've got because we have our shows coming up this weekend and can't not be there for those so hopefully will get better if not don't know what i'm gonna do today went perfectly well got up on time got some work done that had to do and met with my professor [inaudible] which went better than thought it was going to um and then had little bit more free time to do some homework that didn't initially think that would be uh able to do and so got that done but [inaudible] costume so [inaudible] that and then [inaudible] the downside is that am not doing super [inaudible] dance need to practice little more and our [inaudible] is on thursday so that little stressful and since i've been sick it definitely made it lot more difficult um to practice and to be on top of it in rehearsal also we were having an extra rehearsal um so that actually definitely helped 'cause there were only few things that need to work out to be prepared and other than that just need to send my homework so that can um not be stressed out when have to dance today was all right was pretty tired but made it to class on time got all my assignments in um and had fairly good day got some stuff in the mail which was super awesome 'cause had been expecting it um didn't have time however to finish my homework before had to go to dance practice but that should still be all right because um have more free time tomorrow 'cause only have one class so even though i'm getting to bed late hopefully my day will be little bit more relaxed and can get to bed early 'cause don't actually have anything to do on thursday for once which is blessing um and am super excited because had dance practice tonight dress rehearsal and it went really well so had been super nervous the night before but am slightly less nervous because actually semi-know what i'm doing which is really awesome feeling um to have just because i've been working for this for so long and now it finally actually happening our show is in two days and i'm [inaudible] because we're also having an extra practice tomorrow which will help me to go over dance one especially which am still struggling with little bit so hopefully i'll get it all down and then just have to prepare for busy week next week today went pretty well only had one class um so made it on time and had fairly good time 'cause got to work with someone that like um so that was fun and then after that had to meet up with someone from my sorority uh uh which was pretty good [inaudible] to meet her you know and she friends with someone else know which was super [valuable] to find help um and then [inaudible] had to [inaudible] and oh got job offer which was also awesome but it all makes it really hard for me to decide what want to do with my [family and everybody else waiting] back home but feel i'm not sure if should stay um and work but am worried feel like i've [inaudible] things to [inaudible] but feel like it also worth it to stay here and do this for the summer but i've got little bit of time to decide um 'cause have other things to worry about 'cause i've got dance performances starting tomorrow [inaudible] saturday and have paper due next tuesday midterm monday and another midterm tuesday that am definitely less than prepared for um which is unfortunate but all can do now is um study really really hard on sunday um to try and be ready for it and hope for the best um and other than that it going okay i'm not doing terribly well in my classes but i'm also not doing terribly so hopefully it'll get better after spring break when have little bit of time to relax this time i'm gonna try and go back home [inaudible] today went really well um my classes were fine not great but fine and um got chance to practice my dance during the day which was fun um and then we had our first performance this evening which was really cool um was little bit nervous so did mess up tad bit but nothing major so was super happy about that and looking forward to doing all of the other performances so i've got one tomorrow and two on saturday the only downside is that have lot of stuff due next week um but hopefully can take some time to catch up on all of it tomorrow um 'cause dance doesn't get [inaudible] um so then can come home and and do some work and on saturday same thing which might take some work up there with me working on my essay or studying for my midterms um 'cause i've got two midterms next week as well um and other than that um also have to do an application that due by sunday that i'm really excited about 'cause am hoping get the job so we'll see how that goes today went pretty well my first class was nice worked with someone that really enjoy working with felt like like pretty much understood the material but do have test on tuesday that i'm definitely not ready for as well as test on monday and an essay i'm not [inaudible] ready for and my [inaudible] um starts uh it ships this weekend tried show tonight that went really well um but was upset because after it um it lost one of the pieces of my costume so had to let my choreographer know um luckily she was really nice about it anyway i'm gonna try and get it worked out tomorrow 'cause i've got two shows um 'cause don't don't have to get up super early but just little early um might try to be earlier so can go grab yogurt and coffee um just from the shop in my dorm um instead of getting breakfast before go and i'm considering taking some of the work to do 'cause have to watch an entire move um to write response to by sunday so definitely stressed just need to get through all this stuff and then i'll have nice break at spring break so just gotta push through hopefully i'll be able to focus on my study for my test and everything do pretty well today was good uh my last day of [redacted] um which was fun um both performances went really well and got to see quite few of my friends which was really awesome um and managed to get some work that need to get done finished but tomorrow i'm gonna have to um do quite bit as well just 'cause i've got two tests and an essay that i'm little behind on because i've spent so much time on the [redacted] stuff um but it should still go all right at least and uh we'll just we'll have to see um um i'm not really sure but have been really stressed and busy um so i'm glad that spring break coming up 'cause i've already booked my flight home so that'll just be some time to recuperate and come back to um really be on top of it for the next semester but don't know and i'm still debating my summer plans 'cause have few options and i'm not sure which one will be best um 'cause wanna see my family but also need to do stuff for my future um career so i'm probably gonna end up staying on campus all summer but we'll see today didn't go pretty well at all um was feeling pretty depressed and my back was hurting 'cause of all of the dance that i've been doing so basically um slept in late and then spent the whole day in my bed working on stuff um it pretty difficult 'cause didn't get to meet with my tutor so was having really tough time with some of my homework and am still working on it and didn't get enough done 'cause i've got midterm tomorrow that am definitely not prepared for and midterm and an essay on tuesday neither of which i'm prepared for so i'm definitely extremely stressed out but know that after get done with these two days everything will slow down again and then i'll have spring break where hopefully can take some time to get back on top of everything 'cause i'm really excited to see my family 'cause i'll be going home for about eight days which is short amount of time but still fun so it should be nice today [wasn't good] day didn't feel super great and definitely should have gotten more sleep stayed up late doing homework um and was tired basically all day long um which wasn't great 'cause had midterm today which wasn't really ready for so missed one of my other classes um because was studying for the midterm um which isn't good 'cause it the same class that missed two weeks ago and the midterm for that class is coming up too guess just need to prioritize better um especially because was busy with my dance performance this weekend which really cut into study time still feel like it was worth it um also have midterm uh tomorrow that haven't studied for at all because was preparing for the other midterm and my essay that was due so everything is just piling up but it okay 'cause tomorrow is my last super busy day and then hopefully can come down focus get back on top of everything and [inaudible] all right my friend is coming this saturday so hopefully seeing her will be okay um and maybe i'll get to go shopping with my roommate which i've been wanting to do for about month and half um 'cause really need to get some stuff and then have um to finalize some summer plans which i'm gonna work on doing and i've got an interview for job opportunity that really hope that get because have been wanting it for basically the last semester so hopefully that'll go well today was all right um woke up and was pretty exhausted 'cause had trouble getting to sleep last night uh but still managed to get to all my classes and they were all right um did have test this evening that wasn't really ready for um and feel like it went mildly okay [inaudible] great or anything um only have one class tomorrow which will be nice 'cause also have to go to work and i'm planning on um watching two films for class so hopefully i'll get to see some of my friends [inaudible] um and i'm supposed to have lunch date with someone which could be fun but could just be super awkward so we'll see um stayed up little bit later than wanted to because started working on some personal stuff but it was pretty relaxing so guess it was worth it today was all right woke up late but only have one class and that went okay but somehow frustrated 'cause whenever asked her helped on my work um my ca didn't actually help me um and just chatted with some other people um which is definitely frustrating but luckily had meeting with my tutor later on so she explained things little bit more clearly um other than that had um fun lunch date that was really nice and really enjoyed talking to the girl that met with um and after that went to work for bit uh which was hard 'cause did-didn't have enough time to finish everything wanna do today um so have to go back on friday but it shouldn't be too bad and then saturday my friend is supposed to be coming here from texas but haven't heard from her so we'll see what happens with that 'cause have lot of things that need to do otherwise the mid-term [inaudible] sunday and then later we'll [inaudible] so [inaudible] the regular homework on top of that [inaudible] is coming for classes next week um and they're really gonna do shopping this weekend [inaudible] guess we'll just have to see what have time for which is like it not going to be lot sadly but guess that whatever um and also went to watch party for class tonight which was nice 'cause got to see two of my friends there which was really cool 'cause one of them didn't even know was in the class and so [inaudible] [inaudible] got pretty bad headache so it gonna be hard to focus on anything after that today was all right woke up late but still managed to get to class on time which was nice and then got lunch with friend um that normally we never have meals together so that was really cool um didn't do great in math class today but should be better tomorrow we'll see um and then later had to book some flights and file some financial information which was all very stressful um but at least it done now and now still have lot of stuff to do so i'm just glad spring break coming up but before can go on spring break have to write midterm essay um that definitely haven't even started um so i'll probably do classes and work and homework tomorrow and saturday one of my friends is supposed to be coming but haven't heard from her so we'll see and if she doesn't might go shopping or if don't i'll probably just try and get my midterm started we'll see today was fine keep not being able to fall asleep at night which is strange little bit of an issue [inaudible] tired the next day um so woke up late but still made it to class on time um and then only had one other class and had some time in-between that was planning on going to work but the weather was super bad so didn't and after that just ended up um doing some homework which was still good i'm hoping to manage to get little bit of homework done tonight because tomorrow i'm planning on going shopping and i'll also have to make up the work that couldn't do today tomorrow um but it should still be all right do have quite few assignments 'cause next week is going to be really busy and i've got an interview and another event on sunday which means that the majority of my homework will have to be done tomorrow and so hopefully i'll be able to focus and really do it there also party that might wanna go to but we'll see what happens still need to check in and see if any of my friends are going 'cause if they're not then probably won't either but hopefully actually get up on time to go shopping since i'm going to bed later than planned again um but still should still be all right good day it was really fun woke up pretty early went shopping with my roommate and just got to spend little too much money but think have lot of things that really really like so guess it was huge [inaudible] still um other than that spent the afternoon relaxing and doing homework [inaudible] to work today which was good um and then spent the evening going out 'cause my roommate wanted to which didn't plan on doing but it turned out to be lot of fun 'cause got to see lot of friends and also meet lot of really nice new people um and ran into my old ca-captain who gave me advice for an interview that i've got tomorrow which was super awesome 'cause i've been worried about it but um it was really good to to talk to him um 'cause now i'm feeling kinda more confident about doing the interview and i'm really really hoping that get the job 'cause it will just be awesome so we'll see how it goes um and then uh i've got quite bit of homework and test stuff to get ready but can pace it out little bit um so that don't have to do all of it tomorrow um should should still be okay especially 'cause spring break is coming up and if i'm able to focus back home i'll be able to get lot of stuff done then as well which will be really awesome and also getting to see my family it gonna be great literally cannot wait today was okay woke up on time so had time to shower and get ready before had to go to my interview um my interview went fairly well um was little bit rattled at the end because it was [interrupted] but it still went all right and i'm really hoping that get the job because it would be really good for me but was also glad 'cause found out that can work um for the same place over the summer which would be nice 'cause think i'll be um staying on campus over the summer instead of going back home which will be really stressful and know my family is gonna be super upset i'm gonna have to let them know when go home for spring break but feel like it definitely worth it 'cause get to take class and um work to make money and uh just get to spend time sort of figuring out life for myself without having other stresses uh such as my family and my roommate and things like that so hopefully the summer will be really really productive um [inaudible] not as nice because have meeting today so i'm glad got my homework done at reasonable time though am little bit worried 'cause have midterm that about to be due that haven't even started and i've got quiz and an exam but um hopefully it'll all be all right we'll see today was pretty good woke up on time and got ready and was little bit more dressed up today um [math] was okay it was little frustrating because um uh we didn't really get anything done that would actually help us on our [psat] which was frustrating um and then went to my other class which was also um not productive because it class where you really don't actually have to go to lecture to know what going on um but did get some other stuff done during that time um and then spent the evening with some friends we went out to dinner which wasn't great but it was okay um then had um some [inaudible] after that which is why am now working on my homework so late um because wasn't able to earlier tomorrow is also gonna be super busy have quiz that haven't studied for but do have an hour before the quiz that can use to look up for some information so hopefully it'll still go all right and i'm getting my midterm back tomorrow graded um so we'll see how that turns out because don't think that did particularly well on it but who knows hopefully just did well enough today was all right um and we've been to to class this morning and it was okay um had paper back that did pretty well on so was [inaudible] about that got test back as well that didn't do so well on um but did okay enough and i'm gonna talk about it with one of my tfs 'cause think there are some issues with how it was graded um other than that i'm kinda stressed out 'cause have lot of stuff to do and not lot of time to do it especially 'cause it housing day so will want to be to focus on that rather than do my work but have got mid-term too that quite bit of reading usually in lots of different sources mm which can be little bit uh stressful um but it should be all right because have been keeping up fairly well with semester um so hopefully it will end up going okay um and it worth like 30 of my grade so long as pass it it pretty good grade then can do better on the final um i'm just really looking forward to having fun with my [blockmates] um so it should be good today has been pretty good um class went okay and then went to work which was really nice um and then had to focus on work because have quite bit to do and tomorrow is housing day um so i'm going after [school] after i'm working really need to get more stuff done tonight but i'm also hanging out with my friends for housing day so i'm not getting done as much as wanted to but luckily finished some of my other friday homework so really only have to focus on single assignment although it pretty major one that takes quite bit of work so hopefully i'll still be able to finish it was also pumped because got some really good news this evening that got the job had been wanting so i'll be looking forward to doing that um later in the spring and looked into class i'm gonna take over the summer so i'm feeling little bit more excited about that am pretty stressed but i'm also very very very ready to get back home to my family and am super excited to find out what house we're gonna live in for [inaudible] in just few hours and think it'll be the house for the next three years with my blockmates so that should be fun and we're having really good evening um might [drink] later but i'm not sure should 'cause really need to focus on my work so we'll see what happens today was all right um went to bed super late last night and woke up super early because it was housing day um which was lot of fun but also wasn't great because had lot of work to get done and barely any time to do it because we had [semi] events so am little bit frustrated that my teachers made stuff due today um when they also knew that it was housing day so stayed up this late because had to finish really important assignment and midterm and i'm honestly not too certain on how well did on it but guess all can do is wait and see now um and i've got lot to do tomorrow because i'm heading back home on saturday and i've got an sat sunday for another one of my classes so i'm gonna have to go to my classes tomorrow go shopping and get packing and prepare to go home and my [plane] is super early so it'll involve me waking up at ridiculous time or just not getting any sleep at all so we'll just see whatever happens um and hopefully my flight not delayed or canceled or anything because am ready to be home for week today was all right and really didn't get any sleep last night 'cause was studying [inaudible] mid-term um so that wasn't good 'cause was went to class exhausted and [inaudible] proud of it and didn't really know what was going on with the class um but managed to get through it and then had lab which actually went pretty well um [inaudible] kinda talk about it [inaudible] some extra studying for that course which hope catch up on some of my work over spring break but it is only week which seems like no time and i'm gonna have to try and see all of my family and friends especially 'cause i'm not gonna be back home over the summer at all basically um [inaudible] be difficult mm-hmm am very stressed 'cause have to try and make it to my plane on time and it leaves early and i've got an essay that due sunday at midnight and haven't even started yet and i'm gonna do some reading to catch up on it but i'll see how it goes it shouldn't be too bad should be able to work on it at home if have to um and then other than that um i'm just not feeling well 'cause i'm tired i've gotten no sleep so i'm really trying to sleep for bit before have to leave super early um to make it to my plane on time um and this week off will be nice do have few things that have to get done [over] it other than schoolwork but should still have good time being back with my family today was pretty good because was heading home for spring break um got few things done that needed to get done and then had an extension on something that was due at midnight um which was good because was having trouble getting the software to work 'cause it was an online thing and it little bit more stuff set up for my job this summer which was great 'cause was worried about doing that um the only downside is that have an essay due tomorrow night that still haven't been able to start because was spent lot of the day on the plane traveling um so i'll just have to write the whole thing tomorrow but it shouldn't be too bad other than that finally got to see my family which is awesome but had to [inaudible] 'cause wouldn't be home at all over the summer and they took it pretty well probably better than expected but it was still really difficult um but i'm still definitely gonna do the summer program because it super beneficial for me but it did open up the possibility of people coming to visit me which would be super cool 'cause i'm really hoping that maybe we can get that to happen since won't be home at all really mean max maybe week or two so that would be really awesome if someone could come visit me instead today was pretty nice i'm back home with my family for break so got to sleep in whole bunch woke up few times at night but it wasn't too bad um and felt really great today after sleeping for so long um but also [inaudible] unexpected tonight turned it in little bit late because forgot about the time zone difference and think it probably not super good but it was only rough draft so i'm looking forward to improving it in the future tomorrow should be all right 'cause have um [work bit but] it won't be all day long and hopefully while i'm there can get few assignments or um club stuff finished so we'll see how that goes today woke up little bit late 'cause went to bed super late last night um wasn't feeling super well but that okay and had to go to work so did that and just napped in the car before and after work which was nice and it was cool 'cause got to spend the day with my mom and one of her employees who actually really good at his job so don't mind working with him because he tries hard and he knows what he doing um other than that probably should've worked this homework today but decided to take break um and not do anything which means should really get stuff done tomorrow but we'll see whe-whether or not that happens um i'm also trying to make plans with my friends to hanging out since won't be coming home at all over the summer so this is the only time that i'll get to see them until next winter so um hopefully we'll be able to make plans even though don't wanna spend too much time with them 'cause i'd rather spend the time with my family members we'll just see what happens today was all right and then got got my hair cut finally which was nice since haven't done that since like before winter um other than that had to work um which you know was okay got my knees and hips really started hurting so i'm gonna have to go to the chiropractor tomorrow to um get an adjustment which will definitely make me sore for about day but it will also really help um i'm also going to hang out with my friends tomorrow which you know should be okay but i'm not like super looking forward to it or anything because lot of it is sad but whatever um just know that won't see them at all after break so kinda have to hang out with them now um we are going shopping which will be nice since [inaudible] that don't need to spend too much money so hopefully can have self-control but we'll we'll just have to see and then i'm spending the night with my grandmother which will be lot of fun so i'm looking forward to that today was pretty good woke up not feeling super well but other than that um i'm [inaudible] go to work that was okay um and [inaudible] thought like little bit [inaudible] nothing too bad [inaudible] really manageable um and had plans to go to [inaudible] afterward so had to work all day um and [inaudible] glad to hang out with my friends hadn't been too excited about it when first made the plans 'cause actually [inaudible] them it was lot of fun so was really happy that did it 'cause [inaudible] get chance to see see [inaudible] again before have to go back to school um i'm [looking] to see one of them but probably not both um have [inaudible] another friend on friday but that will probably be less fun so am glad went tonight although probably did end up spending little bit too much money definitely more than had planned on spending or wanted to spend but it was probably worth it um so that nothing too bad um other than that have some things due tomorrow so have to work on those um have to get my homework finished because it not too long now before i'm gonna have to go back to school so i'll spend tomorrow at work and doing homework do have to get up kind of early later than lot of the other days i've been getting up so it shouldn't be too bad last night spent the night over at my grandmother um this morning got to sleep in little bit later before heading home to work which was nice but in the night got nosebleed which was not fun at all so think i'm gonna try and start doing the nose sprays whenever that stops happening 'cause it happened at school few times even though went to the doctor about it and he didn't really tell me anything to do um so that was frustrating but other than that work was okay did sort of get into fight with my father about some work stuff um so that didn't go over well but the rest of the evening was enjoyable 'cause just worked with my mom and my brother and some employees and the employees were catching on more than thought so that always nice to see um and then my aunt and uncle came by and hadn't gotten to see them yet so that was really cool got to talk for bit i'm not sure i'll see them again before leave for [redacted] but they did mention coming to visit me this summer which would actually be really happy about 'cause i've been trying to convince family members to come and visit me since i'll be spending all summer not being home um so if they do and few others do that would be really cool um it always nice to see them and had plans to hang out with friend tomorrow but he had to cancel last minute so he changed it to saturday instead which will actually end up working out better um and [could] put little bit more of time frame on it 'cause don't wanna end up hanging out with him for super long time 'cause when went to hang out with friends the other night it ended up being for few hours and hadn't intended it to be that long so hopefully this one will be lot more doable um because my main goal is still to spend time with my family before anyone else so i'm am like seeing my friends but [really wanna make] more of an effort to see my family members um so having limited time to be able to hang out really helps that quite bit um so that should be good today um woke up [inaudible] super tired because went to bed late last night again um and went to work but fell asleep in the [class] [inaudible] ended up not going in until like 1030 which is basically when we open but it was still fine um then didn't feel too great during the workday because um i'm feeling [a little] like cramps and stuff um so that was little bit frustrating and then because i'm working with new employees they don't really know what they're doing yet which means that have to work lot harder to make sure everything goes out right and on time doing my own job while um watching them and doing quality control but did get to see some relatives and some of my other family friends that came at the restaurant which was kind of nice um then afterward we um went out for dinner but it was super late so was just tired and grouchy and really out of it um and hopefully tomorrow i'll be hanging out with my friend and hopefully can leave work early to do some homework because we've been so busy at work that haven't been able to do any of what wanted to get done which definitely sucks so uh if not possible i'll just [inaudible] work late tomorrow to do my homework since i'm going back to school on sunday today woke up not feeling too well again because of cramps and stuff um so took little bit longer than thought would to get ready um but really just since wasn't feeling well perhaps that uh and work and did spend the morning [following] more slowly and not really helping out as much um because took some medicine and tried to sit down for bit then when felt better started helping out more which is good and then hang out with one of my friends slightly later in the day which is good because needed to see him before leave left um tomorrow and we had fun time going around got present for my roommate and have some other stuff for my [blockmates] so that'll be nice for when go back um but on the downside i'm really behind on the homework that was supposed to do over break so i'm gonna have to try and do it tomorrow while spending time with all of the family that didn't get to see otherwise so hopefully have time to finish everything because i'm gonna be pretty exhausted so going back to school and immediately being exhausted so it not going to be the best thing to happen today was getting ready to leave and go back to school but then it turned out that my flight was delayed so just switched it to tomorrow which is little bit more difficult because had to turn in all of my homework online so hopefully the teachers will still accept it since couldn't really control my flight um but we'll see when they email me back tomorrow have presentation in class on tuesday that i'm kind of nervous about and got quite few things to get done right when get back to campus um so i'm definitely really stressed and honestly i'm at point where don't even want to go back to school which is really difficult for me because [i'd been away] since december and i'm it really not good because know that need to do it just have to find the motivation i'm not sure what going on but think i'm gonna try and talk to my therapist about it the next time meet with her and maybe i'll figure it out today returned back to school um so had to wake up really early and go to the airport which was okay but really wasn't feeling well which made it difficult especially being on plane for so long so when finally did get to school was not feeling well at all and ended up just showering and taking nap which was not good because have lot of homework to do um but then later when um woke up had extracurricular things so did that came home and hang out with some friends so ended up staying up pretty late to do my homework but did nap well so it should be okay and hopefully can spend little bit of time napping tomorrow because only have one class on wednesday so definitely need to catch up on my sleep and try and get back into the routine of school and catch up on the work that i'm behind in um but i'm also really excited because we're having big little week this week with my sorority and think it'll be super awesome um already got an email from my big and we start getting gifts and stuff on wednesday so i'm really looking forward to that um and have plans with my friends for friday night and thursday evening so hopefully that'll all be super fun and lastly have presentation tomorrow that i'm little bit stressed about but it should be okay because have partner and we prepared for it um other than that hopefully i'll just be able to wake up on time since still haven't finished my homework and i'm already really sleepy today was just good woke up on time made it to class on time but didn't have time to shower this morning but it okay 'cause showered last night um [so that was still fine] um and then was gonna have lunch but feel like [inaudible] not good anymore so did still eat some of it but not [inaudible] doing um and other than that had class and went shopping and cleaned up my room because someone supposed to be coming over tomorrow [inaudible] did my homework in semi-timely fashion probably could've focused little bit more 'cause kept getting distracted but still got it done and feel like it went really well so i'm pretty pleased about that um especially 'cause had really productive workshop where felt like my [ca] really helped me understand some stuff had been having trouble with which was awesome hmm and i'm expecting to get pretty major grade or two [inaudible] tomorrow so we'll see how that goes and did get [inaudible] grade back today that felt like was pretty good all things considered so that was nice um and then also have plans on friday with my friends which will hopefully work out because think it'll be lot of fun today was pretty good woke up with plenty of time and only had one class and it went really well 'cause got to work with people that really enjoy working with and feel like we were really productive and really understood what was going on and then went for my tutoring and finished almost the entire pset which was absolutely awesome because then i'll have less work tomorrow especially 'cause i'm little bit behind with my next [inaudible] so i'll need to refocus little bit um and also had work today and worked for longer than normal which was actually really nice because i'll make little bit more money um when get my next paycheck um which is cool and then other than that got [inaudible] for my new [inaudible] today which was super duper awesome and just really nice to have someone more [inaudible] present in your room for you and did make some plans um with friends um to possibly go out together so i'll be looking forward to that [inaudible] um tomorrow supposed to be quite cold and snowy so hopefully i'll wake up in enough time to shower early so my hair won't freeze on the way to class again but we'll see because intend to sleep in as long as possibly can um yeah that why get the most of my stuff prepared the night before so hopefully it won't be too bad in the morning today was pretty good was little bit late to class but not too bad um and it was really productive period felt like really got ahead on my work and had meeting with the teacher that was little apprehensive about but feel like it went fairly well and hopefully can be prepared for the next test and my next classes and everything tomorrow will be little bit busy just because have my really long lab and need to do some stuff beforehand to get ready for it but i'm also meeting with another teacher um but it'll be good because it go over some work that gonna be do next tuesday um and feel like i'm fairly well prepared know need to do little bit more search for some evidence but that shouldn't factor too much into our discussion tomorrow because that just something that know have to get done um and hopefully i'll be able to schedule time to go the writing center before have to turn in the paper which means i'll have to stay on top of it i'm planning on devoting most of my saturday to working i'll probably leave the room and go study somewhere else can really focus um other than that already did work this week because wanted to do that [inaudible] which is good because that gives me more time for homework um which i've really been trying to stay on top of and then there was also party tomorrow evening that said would go to but i'm still debating gonna see what my other friends decide so probably [inaudible] off that just be haven't really been feeling up to the party mood um so we'll we'll just have to see and hopefully can get everything done before the lab tomorrow 'cause don't have too much time because i've got class and meeting before it um today woke up pretty late because got to sleep in um from last night which was definitely kind of mess um but had lot to get done because have bunch of stuff due for sunday um but one of the things that needed to watch it [inaudible] for class um and that definitely took long time so did that did some of my other work um but also took nap since wasn't feeling too well so probably should've gotten some more done but do have meeting with someone tomorrow so i'll finish homework then and then i'll shouldn't it shouldn't be too difficult to get my other homework done hopefully but we'll see am definitely worried about money have been working but i'm worried that it still not gonna be enough um 'cause now have extra dues for stuff but we'll see how it goes i'll try and work extra this week worked extra last week too and was supposed to get paid for the study i'm doing but haven't and [it time] end up asking about that as well just because definitely don't wanna be short on money today was pretty good um was really busy with my homework but did get it done even though it was pretty late when fi-finished um but other than that just had little some small frustrations [with friend] um there was some drama back home with my family but should be okay can talk to my mom and my little sisters [a lot] um but other than that was just trying to get all my work done so hopefully [inaudible] [so all my stuff isn't] going too well um and have pretty busy few weeks coming up and all the [inaudible] always seem to be busy but at least i'm excited tomorrow because i'm gonna have little segment to find out who my date is although the timing is kind of poor because have [inaudible] event at the same time that won't be able to go to um but hopefully it is still okay think can make up for other event that have to miss by going to [inaudible] later hopefully um and i'm just really stressed about assignments due on tuesday other than that i'm pretty much on top of my stuff more or less that is um but should be able to talk to my professor bit about this essay um and can try to go to the writing center if need to hopefully just [inaudible] me to be able to really be on top of it 'cause sometimes you just have to get into the mindset to be able to write something well so we'll see how it goes um but yeah other than that don't really know just gotta you know get some stuff done hmm today was lot of fun um went to my classes on time woke up ahead of time didn't feel too tired or anything although didn't feel super well this morning it wasn't too bad um so think overall the day went really well had really good time because in the evening had lot of um plans and they were lot of fun um got to hang out with [inaudible] he comes with friend of mine and got to hang out with my other um good friends which was super nice 'cause we made plans for this weekend um and had few surprises today had little get-together in my honor which was quite fun um and then spent the evening working on my essay which was definitely struggle but feel like it ended up in really good place um so i'm feeling pretty solid about what submitted and really looking forward to getting it back 'cause know won't have it back for few weeks um have kind of busy day tomorrow um especially 'cause had to reschedule meeting with my teacher for tomorrow rather than doing it later in the week like had wanted to but hopefully that goes all right because don't have too many things that have to go over with her um so she'll only take about 30 minutes and then i'm [inaudible] train to get to my work definitely early since have handful of class on wednesday so that can go to work and focus on doing some laundry and some other stuff um and then hopefully spend little time uh talking to my family members which got to do today but not too much so it although today it was also pretty busy in addition need to start studying because have tests coming up next week and definitely want to do better on the second exams than did on the first ones so i've been trying to focus on studying lot today has been all right um woke up and got to sleep in little later since had all my stuff ready for class last night um which was really nice since stayed up so late working on my essay and then talked to few people from the same class felt better because they had said that they also spent quite bit of time on their essays as well and had to stay up late um so thought that was pretty good sign um other than that had two classes and they all went fine as well but did feel little bit out of it and disconnected from my family today but have had decent [inaudible] before so know that i'll probably be better tomorrow um and even if not it fine i'll just go about my work 'cause i've got [inaudible] my job tomorrow um and i've got two tests coming up next week so i'm trying to be on top of that and have friend who wants to hang out this weekend and i'm really looking forward to going out with her so hopefully we are able to do that but we'll see today was still feeling pretty off even though went to bed really early last night ended up waking up pretty late anyway was almost late to class so guess i've just generally been feeling out bit but did get all my homework done for friday and [inaudible] some lab prep need to do that'll be [inaudible] tomorrow morning pretty busy um i'm glad that [inaudible] make lunch plans with some people that know um so that should be fun guess um [inaudible] might be little bit awkward but hopefully it'll turn out all right um and then [inaudible] so went to work today which was frustrating and awkward and even forgot to sign out so have to go back probably tomorrow or another day to fix that it should actually okay 'cause it'll only take like two minutes um and then i've been forgetting that need to do some stuff for another extra-curricular and that should've been done on saturday but should be able to finish before the actual date so that should be okay um other than that april definitely gonna been busy starting with two tests that have next week that haven't been um studying for but hopefully can dedicate saturday to that just need to get on top of some homework that due on sunday um so hopefully that'll be all right but don't really know we'll see just have to focus on and get out of this weird funk that i'm in today was all right was feeling little bit out of it but mostly on top of everything um got to class little bit late but it wasn't bad and showered this morning which was nice and had time to relax little bit then had lunch with some friends which turned out to be [inaudible] 'cause got to see uh well first got to meet someone new and then got to um see one of the friends had lunch with later in the day which was [inaudible] um other than that my other class was pretty good although didn't pay too much attention and probably should have 'cause have test coming up but [inaudible] test so it not that big of deal um then after that had more time to relax then got to hang out with some [inaudible] that really enjoy talking to so that was awesome um and then spent the evening with friends as well [inaudible] little bit frustrating but it got better afterwards because heard from friend back home that haven't heard from in while and we were having pretty good conversation but was really annoyed because it got interrupted but i'm sure that we'll finish it some other time 'cause know can rely on him and i'll definitely wanna talk to him about stuff because he someone that always gonna be there for me no matter what which appreciate because think he was probably one of the only friends that can consider to be like that um the weekend is definitely gonna be long because test preparation and my roommate has her girlfriend coming over which is gonna be annoying because she wants us to spend bunch of time with her which don't wanna [understand] whatever i'll probably just try and avoid the room or something and prepare for the two tests have next week so we'll see how it goes today was all right wasn't feeling super well but classes weren't too long and my stuff is relatively easy so had an okay time doing that um and then spent the evening relaxing we did get to hang out with friend which was good 'cause was supposed to see him last night and didn't but after that just was really having lot of trouble um was sort of dissociating and getting into down mood um but then called one of my friends from back home and he really helped lot so hopefully i'll do better um 'cause definitely wasted this evening and i've got two tests and some other stuff that needs to get done for next week um so i'm definitely gonna have to focus tomorrow since i've got fairly busy day on sunday um and i'm supposed to go to friend event tomorrow night too so we'll see what happens 'cause do really want to go but also know that need to get my work done especially studying for these tests which didn't do super well on the last ones um but was glad 'cause made few purchases 'cause got some good news about my finances so that'll help if anything else today definitely felt really out of it um just felt as if there was something really off um so did not get too much done which was difficult because i've got mid-term monday that i'm super worried about um so hopefully by the time wake up tomorrow i'll be feeling better because do have few things to do on top of the mid-term so hopefully can get everything done and be ready for um my test by studying just have [sort of] travel plan with [redacted] and some other friends um so i've been talking to people on the phone and trying to [get out] which is good but at the same time it takes up lot of time and should just be studying haven't been able to find good place to do that and be productive um it has been more difficult um but um i'll i'll i'll get through it really think this summer and next term will go lot better um and you know one of the main things i'm trying to do is just to distance myself from it all and stop being so concerned unless the partnerships are worth it um but we'll see how that actually goes because can say that but actually doing that is completely other thing um but i'm i'm definitely trying and just need to get out of this funk pretty quickly 'cause i've got busy day tomorrow today went pretty well had meeting this morning about work which was nice because got to find out more about what i'll be doing this summer um which was lot of fun but um other than that had um lot of homework to do because have mid-term tomorrow so spent like five hours studying for it and still don't feel prepared at all so i'll study lot more tomorrow as well um especially because today had to um do some extra homework as well so didn't totally dedicate all my time to studying so i'm gonna try and do that tomorrow since the test isn't until 700 pm and only have two classes but also have to wake up early because have an appointment so i'll see how it goes think the important appointment will go really well think just because i'm gonna talk really seriously to my um therapist and have some stuff to do throughout the week so think this week will be good especially because i'm gonna get super busy starting this weekend so i'm wanna have this [super] relaxing week which it would be better because i'll get my last two tests done this week and then just have to worry about finals coming up um so that will definitely help bring my stress levels down and then hopefully can make some time to go to the chiropractor because my back has been acting up um but we'll just see [inaudible] and i'm just gonna deliberate about this test and hoping it goes well today was pretty good woke up early and had an appointment that actually turned out pretty well and talked of some stuff for the future uh [inaudible] stuff in the morning with some [clients] which was nice although was scared but it should be okay um mean [inaudible] with friend that haven't seen since like last semester so that was super awesome to get to catch up with that friend and then have plans for tomorrow morning uh so have to get up early once again um to see how that goes [inaudible] and then i'm gonna be heading off to [inaudible] so so started preparing for another [inaudible] through working out and stuff but also have well homework and things um to get done so we'll see how it goes um don't know but i'm really looking forward to going into [inaudible] so it'll be awesome actually um yeah [inaudible] just have to try and get some stuff done 'cause definitely have been pretty busy at the moment so we'll see today was pretty good had to wake up pretty early and go to meeting this morning um that ran little late so was almost late to my class but managed to make it just before they actually started which was good um and then was little bit tired but it okay because can sleep in little bit later tomorrow morning anyways so it not that big of deal um and on the plus side uh only have one class tomorrow but do have few other thing i'm going for an appointment with [inaudible] to address but that should be good just to get some medicine and then to make another appointment with [inaudible] which i've been trying to do for while and haven't had time so i'm happy that i'll finally get chance to do it tomorrow and then this weekend gonna be really busy which i'm not looking forward to but i'm happy because finally managed to book an appointment with the chiropractor even though it is for next week but after go to that should be feeling better um other than that i've got midterm thursday night that i'm little worried about but honestly feel i'll be prepared for which is cool because in the past haven't um and i'm meeting with my tutor tomorrow to go over some stuff as well which should help and other than that i've got to work tomorrow and um we've got friend coming over um which is pretty nice because never had dinner with my roommate and another friend that didn't know too well um managed to talk to him little bit which i'm hoping i'll kind of get to talk to him one on one in the future because he seems pretty nice and feel like we could be good friends but it kind of difficult 'cause i've found with my roommate she [inaudible] dominates the conversation so hopefully we'll get some chances to talk one on one instead so get to know him better we'll see today was pretty good had [inaudible] quiz this morning which was frustrating 'cause that one of my least favorite things to do in math um but it didn't go super poorly it was okay don't think i'll get [great grade] on that though because never contribute enough to my group um but i'm not too stressed about it after that um went to work which was really nice because that means i'm done for the week and i've got bunch of trainings and stuff this weekend so definitely had to get it done today um and got to talk to my family while was working bit which was great because hadn't spoken to my grandmother in while and also got to hear from my sister which was cool and then after that met up with my tutor to go over some math stuff and feel really prepared for the midterm which is great feeling because normally think i'm not ready but think could actually do [inaudible] and then after that had doctor appointment which was really good 'cause got lot of stuff um solved but ended up spending lot of money because had misconceptions about the cost of some stuff um which was not cool but guess i'll just have to make it up with work um which shouldn't be too bad and then [got to] spend the evening [meeting] with friends and went to dinner with some friends which was okay but then extra people joined us which was frustrating um but then [inaudible] we ha-hang out with someone that i've [inaudible] and she really cool so think we'll probably start hanging out little bit more which is really nice because feel like friend group is growing and i'm meeting some really awesome people that feel like could become really close to so that was really awesome and think tomorrow will be okay [inaudible] my days are gonna start getting really busy starting this weekend so it should be okay think can handle it today went all right had really good morning class even though was little bit late to it um but was really pleased because some of my friends asked me to lunch and didn't have to ask them this time which was super awesome 'cause we're all becoming closer and then uh we even had someone extra join us which was cool 'cause hadn't met him before so that was nice and he seems super chill um someone that easy to get along with other than that uh had few homework assignments but got them all done and then had mid-term this evening which thought was ready for but think messed up few times on the actual exam um but it okay think still did not too terribly um so i'll just do corrections and get some points back like that um other than that oh had tea tonight with friends with dinner which was good but at the same time we had dinner with someone um who very loud and my roommate also very loud and they're both super outgoing so they sort of dominated the whole conversation which is difficult for me because don't like talking over people so get to feel really disconnected when that happening um but maybe in the future i'll get to talk to him more one-on-one so feel more comfortable around him um and then it was good because heard from one of my friends back home who been through rough time right now though 'cause he broke up with his fiancee so talked to him for while and think helped him which was nice and then um we had friends over this evening so definitely ended up staying up way later than was planning on it but honestly feel like it was worth it especially 'cause going into this weekend i'm gonna have less time to hang out with friends now as get busier um so it was good to have this little um break and good to see people especially 'cause one of my other friends was also going through hard time so think it was also nice for him to see us and sort of take break and know that we're there for him so that was really cool today was okay we stayed up way too late last night so was [inaudible] [a bit] tired um but my first class was still fine and then had little time between that and my next class where got to relax and get few things done which was good um and then had lu lab which was little frustrating but we still managed to get out an hour early um so that was nice and then super exhausting but had to talk to friend for bit 'cause he going through rough time so i've been [getting him some] [inaudible] and then went to dinner with some other friends which was good except we were all so out of it barely even talked mostly just sat there and ate but was really happy because got to get some lemonade which had been wanting to do for while and and some cereal and stuff then we came home and just relaxed probably stayed up too late again but can sleep in little bit tomorrow because don't have anything until o'clock and then after that i'm gonna try and spend the whole evening doing homework um because sunday it going to be super-duper busy um so have to really get lot of stuff done tomorrow so hopefully will actually be able to focus and do that um other than that sort of made an impulse buying decision but feel like it'll turn out to be okay there something i've been wanting and managed to get it [on sale too] which was nice so hopefully that'll motivate me to do better um since treated myself little bit so we'll just see how tomorrow goes i'm gonna try and get up little early so have some time to shower and get some stuff done before have to go to work um get trained for my new job which i'm pretty pumped about so it should be all right today turned out to be really good um decided to go out even though hadn't been planning on it because this morning woke up to little bit of work and then had training for my job coming up this spring um and after that um went back to the room and got my roommate because she been sick so took her to go um to the doctor and went in and got few things and it was lot of fun but know should probably do homework tonight because wasn't planning on going out but then everyone hadn't hung out with in while texted me so ended up going out with her and the party was all right didn't have too much of great time but it was still pretty fun and then had to get my friend home safely which did and then went to get pizza and it was super awesome because some random person just paid for my pizza so just got some free pizza um and then now i'm heading back to my dorm and i'm not feeling super well and have to get up early tomorrow which sucks but it should be all right because had really nice night so think it was worth going out um and then hopefully i'll have time to get all my stuff done tomorrow and if don't there just one little thing that won't matter too much so it should be okay today had really busy day um spent the morning doing an extracurricular and right after that had to run to training for my job but it went really well um had great time and got to see one of my captains which was cool then had to run to tutor and to get my homework done uh which finished and managed to finish my other homework on time too and then had um another event to go to in the night but it was really cool because found out some great information about all the work starting at the beginning of the summer um like who my mentors are the hours where i'll be working stuff like that and i'm super excited about it and made plans to meet with my mentors later this week so that'll also be really good 'cause i'm ready to start preparing and heard from my sister um and we're going um to thing together so she was just sending me some information which made me really happy 'cause i'm super pumped about it even though it definitely gonna be super busy don't think i'm gonna get enough sleep at all this week but hopefully can get through it we'll see today was pretty good and was on time to my class um it was okay our regular teacher is gone and the replacement we have wasn't great but he wasn't terrible either so that was all right um and then after that ended up skipping my other lectures 'cause wasn't feeling too well and had laundry to do and [inaudible] stuff to do for um job that have and then made some plans um to get lunch later in the week with friend and talked to my sister about visiting her next weekend got some more information on plans for this weekend um which included making plans with another friend to visit and [inaudible] go out just depending on um how i'm feeling and how we both are over this weekend um and then have um just lot of stuff that due that worked on um which was pretty good and although am still little bit behind but feel bit little bit more confident about my respective class papers um and also found out that have quiz and test next week on the same day um but um feel little okay about the test the quiz is more iffy um need to do some more work on that but hopefully lab have this week will help me out in preparing for that but we'll see have one class tomorrow that i'm really worried about because it section that normally we just have [inaudible] for but this time we're having our actual professor uh um and generally don't like talking in sections so really doubt that will talk tomorrow um but we'll see how it goes maybe it'll be fine and he won't make us all talk just don't know what he gonna be like 'cause in lecturer he pretty um different than the other professors that i've had so hopefully it'll work out to be okay today wasn't feeling too well so missed both of my morning classes which wasn't great but talked to my professors so it should be okay and and um other than that did some homework but really just spent most of the day sitting around just because wasn't feeling well then did go to doctor appointment however they didn't actually tell me anything which was definitely frustrating but it should be okay because i'm going to see my chiropractor tomorrow so if anything else that should make me feel at least little bit better 'cause it usually does and then wednesday i've only got one class but i've got plans with friend which will be nice and then have to go submit form for my summer [inaudible] that shouldn't take too long and then thursday and friday i'm super busy so hopefully [i can get] all my stuff done on time for thursday and for friday and then might have plans to go shopping with friend this weekend and have big event on saturday which i'm looking forward to but little bit nervous about today was all right [inaudible] really early i'm excited [for] an appointment this morning um so got up on time did [inaudible] right on time and even got to talk to my mom on the way which was super nice um 'cause haven't heard from her in while and then on the way back talked to her again turned in some paperworks that needed to be in before friday so that was really good and then um made it to class on time 'cause [inaudible] got coffee beforehand which was great since was tired um class really went well and then afterwards got to have lunch with my big from my sorority and that was super great since i'd only really have gotten to hung hang out with her one-on-one once before so that was super nice and feel like we really get along well and i'm super excited that we're gonna be spending the entire summer together basically um other than that went to work and got to have more time than usually do and on top of that already have more time than normal for this week due to training and other stuff so that gonna be really nice getting that paycheck next week especially because had to rebook my flight to visit my sister next weekend which cost little bit more than wanted it to but it worth it because she super excited and i'm excited i'm just gonna have to get through the class two days of classes but am super busy 'cause i've got two pretty big assignments due friday and haven't had time to start either of them and i've got really full day tomorrow as well as starting with 900 am meeting with one of my mentors for the job that i'll be starting this spring um but it should go all right 'cause don't have any super specific questions that always seem to [inaudible] and get some general ideas about the stuff that need to have done so should be good 'cause we can um set date for my test and can start prepping for that after finish up with my stuff this weekend um and this weekend i'll also [inaudible] shop with friend which i'm looking forward to and then there concert on friday night that i'm gonna go to and have an event all day saturday that should be really fun and hopefully get some homework done during it because i've got two papers and two finals and test and quiz coming up so it should be pretty good today was all right wasn't feeling great [inaudible] but um was able to do all the stuff had to do met with my uh mentors this morning and then had the class all day uh which was okay [inaudible] great so i'm getting pretty frustrated with some of my classes and i've got quite few things to do tomorrow [inaudible] didn't have to do tomorrow and it due by midnight so hopefully i'll finish it on time um and then other than that got some [time] with friends so that should be okay but don't know if they actually [inaudible] or not 'cause know she pretty busy so if she can't go i'll probably just go by myself um and [inaudible] with me which we will see how [inaudible] it [inaudible] just sucks that i'm not feeling well especially 'cause um have pretty big event on saturday and it gonna take all day long and kind of would rather just be sleeping especially in the [afternoon] i'm [not] getting enough sleep sometimes [inaudible] on uh stuff for my classes so it pretty frustrating but hopefully i'll get over it soon because got plans next weekend too today was okay woke up really not feeling well but this time did actually make it to class on time and class was really small for some reason lot of people didn't come which kind of made me sad but got to work with someone that haven't worked with in while and like her quite bit so that was good and then had an appointment for coffee and it was just someone had never met before but we actually had really really great conversation really enjoyed talking to her and she gave me lot of good advice which made me feel better about how i'm doing um then we made plans for the future together which i'm looking forward to lot because think that could be really good friends with her um and hopefully that'll help me develop as better person in my own life um then spent the evening shopping which i've been wanting to do for while and intended to do in preparation for an exam tomorrow so i'm ready and hopefully the event tomorrow which is going to be long will be all right because i'm not really expecting it to be great but maybe it will be am sad though because my two good friends can't come to it and really wanted them to be able to but can just take some work and hopefully get that done get some emails sent and stuff prepared for next week and next weekend i'll be visiting my sister so i'm pretty excited about that today was all right had an event all day long that was little bit [inaudible] but not too bad went out of town and just spent lot of time talking on [inaudible] [inaudible] little sad because my two close friends couldn't make it so didn't have anyone that was super good friends with there so instead of staying to myself lot started talking to some of the other girls which was cool and then came back home did little bit of work sent some emails but i've just been feeling super sick and um down so didn't get too much done um then spent the evening with friends and we went to party and it was lot of fun and um just came back home to relax so tomorrow i'm gonna have to focus on doing quite bit of my homework since haven't done anything any today [inaudible] just my essays that i'm worried about my other classes should be all right and do have quiz on tuesday and two presentations coming up [inaudible] hope it will work out will be okay and then will be excited to see my sister next weekend today was all right slept in um lot because wasn't feeling too well lately um which ended up being really good 'cause then felt better during the day [inaudible] still super out of it and had quite bit of homework to do so got um bunch of it done but still ended up staying awake [inaudible] just 'cause i've got two projects this week and two papers which still haven't turned the abstract in for one and i'm super confused about where i'm going with the other so hopefully i'll have time to meet with my to have tomorrow to talk to him um 'cause [inaudible] regret that haven't turned it in yet well i'll turn it in tomorrow guess and just see how it goes i'm little worried about waking up on time and everything because i'm still feeling pretty sick but hopefully i'll make it and then on tuesday i've got quiz uh and [inaudible] which is really frustrating because need to study for both on top of pretty big assignment due too but this whole week is just gonna be pretty rough and then this weekend i'm going to california so hopefully won't be as sick then because i'm losing my voice and everything and i'll get to see my sister for the weekend which hopefully should be exciting and then i'll come back and have my last few days of classes before um finals and finals should go all right although those two papers have to write are not gonna go very well but as long as can just get on them end with in those classes then it should be okay we'll see though today was pretty good woke up on time to do my first class in the morning um my teacher checked in with me to make sure was doing okay which was nice but also frustrating um and after that took so little of time between classes to work on something and then um had to ate some lunch and then had to go to my other class um so did it but didn't feel too well sort of was coughing lot and stuff like that which was frustrating but after class was good because met with my tf and talked to him about her project which was really awesome and then came home and got kind of stuck in cleaning mood so did that for while and then started doing homework but it frustrating 'cause the assignment tough and i've got quiz and test tomorrow that i'm definitely not ready for so have to study for the quiz right before class and hopefully i'll be okay on the test because i'm pretty good at what we're supposed to be doing so it shouldn't be too bad hopefully as long as can remember all of the rules have been should be able to finish that i'm looking to go to bed at least little early tomorrow night so it should be okay 'cause i've got work on wednesday as well so [inaudible] at 300 tonight [inaudible] only got forward little bit today was all right barely got any sleep last night so that was definitely struggle but still made it to class relatively on time um which that class is just frustrating me it why stayed up so late too and i've got another big assignment due thursday which sucks because that means have to do all of it tomorrow and on top of the project that have due friday and bunch of other stuff because also have an entire paper for that class due sunday so that class is really the only one that causing me whole bunch of trouble if didn't have it then would probably be doing just fine in all of my courses um so don't know about that it just kind of annoying um but you know it whatever and i'll just have to try and get it done because i'm going to visit my sister so guess can work on the airplane and hopefully have it done on time guess can just stay up if need to do it or can work on that on sunday however that sucks because wanna spend time with her but i've got really busy day thursday wednesday my only like relatively free day but got lot of homework and i've gotta go to work which makes it less [three] free and then thursday i've got formal that i'm going to with my friend that i'm super excited about but it is gonna take up all of my evening so won't really be able to do homework then which is why i've gotta try and finish all of it um tomorrow as well as this whole entire paper so that cool but did have test today and feel like it went relatively well i'm trying to be happy about it and had [inaudible] and [inaudible] some tests but still think definitely passed at least which is nice so that yeah everything all right i'm just trying to get to bed soon because i'm all jittery from getting no sleep last night and didn't wanna nap today because it would mess up my sleep schedule more so as soon as finish watching film with my friend i'm gonna go to bed today was [hard for me] um my throat started getting really sore so lost my voice this morning and had group work which was super frustrating because then didn't get chance to actually contribute or help very much but that just how it happens sometimes and still feel like class was productive because understood what we were doing in the end and got jump start on my homework for friday which is good because i've got party tomorrow night that i'm going to with good friend um which will hopefully be fun i'm not sure depending on how many people end up going but there should be smores and stuff so it should be fun regardless and then talked to my sister today uh i'm visiting her this weekend and that was really great 'cause have better idea of what to pack and everything for thursday which was awesome um i'm feeling little frustrated 'cause skipped class earlier in the week for being tired and i'll probably do it again tomorrow um because guess have lot of stuff to do coming up that needs to be done before the weekend um because this is our last week of classes so we're having all of our final projects and assignments so need to try and get ahead tomorrow so might just have to skip that class again the lectures are videotaped so it shouldn't be too bad to catch up and know we'll be going over some of the [information] [inaudible] it should make it lot better but yeah um know [inaudible] to bed late again but that just how it is sometimes today was all right woke up really not feeling well and had to go to class um and we had [workshopping] thing so we did that and it was fun um got better feedback from my peers than expected um but then got feedback from my teacher [inaudible] later tonight um and it wasn't as good which is upsetting but went ahead and emailed him so that he can help me out and get the paper in the direction it needs to be going to because um it due sunday by midnight and tomorrow fly out to um stay with my sister for the weekend so have to really be on top of everything which sucks because i'm extremely busy so i'll probably be doing homework on the plane or in the airport or maybe just staying up and doing it and not sleeping when i'm over at her place but we'll see how it goes um i'm pretty frustrated um just really need this semester to be over with um i'm not sure um how it gonna end up but hopefully it'll end up okay don't know we'll see think i've done not as well as hoped but well enough in all the classes so that should be all right today was all right made it back to campus it just took little bit of time to get from the airport to here and i'm super [inaudible] started way too late working on my um essay for [inaudible] and some other homework-ey stuff um so was super stressed and just turned my homework in and went home and passed out because was so exhausted um so feel little bit bad that didn't make it to class and know that my teacher is probably gonna ask me what [inaudible] [yesterday] but wasn't feeling well and definitely needed nap because happened to stay up and do homework late into the night uh which did and finished [inaudible] and then feel bit stressed [today] because the printer not working so have to try and get up early and have to go print some stuff tomorrow before class which hopefully i'll be able to do because tend to sleep in until the last possible minute so hopefully will be able to actually make myself get up at some time it was little bit harder than that in california because enjoyed my time there it was super nice and made some good friends um even though only met them for about day and i'll definitely miss my sister ton [inaudible] question why was at harvard just because feel that would be lot happier if wasn't here and [inaudible] and i'll probably need uh for my future but i'm going to talk to my counselor tomorrow so hopefully that will help with me figuring some stuff out today wasn't great woke up little bit late got to class late um [i finally] did some did some [inaudible] but um it wasn't really that productive um and then had another class and that was basically fine [inaudible] lecture because wasn't feeling too well [inaudible] back that did [inaudible] but it still wasn't [inaudible] and then um had one appointment with my therapist and just got really upset so ended up crying lot and stuff like that and just feel really isolated from everyone else coming back to california [inaudible] i'm in really bad mindset [inaudible] the semester don't don't really know what i'm gonna do about it because it putting me behind in my work and i've got quite few things to do coming up this week and next week yeah um and also there something that wrong with my tooth but don't have time to go to dentist or figure it out or have the financial means because right now can't even pay off my credit card um which is really stressful 'cause it never gotten this bad before um and think lot of it is just due to being in california um but yeah other than that i'm really happy uh and have lot to do to fix it today was the last day of classes it was okay mean it didn't go particularly great but it [inaudible] waste of time just have to get through finals and then start my job um still [inaudible] my [job] [inaudible] which hopefully will go well have test on friday and need to finish some stuff in preparation for it um it hopefully won't be too difficult we'll see um am looking forward to that job know it definitely gonna be hard to run crew um especially as i'm very introverted person and [inaudible] that it [inaudible] really isolated from people after having come back from california they don't know that am here and what [inaudible] doing [inaudible] i'm friends with the people i'm friends with uh nothing feels like it worth it anymore but just have to keep working and get through it because ultimately this isn't about me or my happiness it just about getting degree and being able to provide for my family and my mom lot of stuff just seems really pointless lately and really don't know what to do to make it better talked to my counselor but it really didn't help and she didn't have anything to tell me um but know just have to stick it out because i'm meeting up with some other friends later in the week and next week that feel communicate little bit better because actually like them get along with them even though i'm not particularly close to them um and yeah really don't know what to do didn't [inaudible] like [inaudible] other stuff so today was fine woke up on time to go met with my professor it was [inaudible] because he gave my feedback late so hadn't really had the time to [inaudible] before went but it turned out didn't need to worry because the [inaudible] went really well he was super nice and had good time chatting with him especially 'cause might not see him again that [inaudible] to the end of this semester and don't have class with him anymore it was really nice because he had told me how much fun it was to have me in class which appreciated because think definitely struggled little bit but [inaudible] time really had good time as well so i'm glad that he also appreciated my participation [inaudible] this semester then made plans to meet some people tomorrow for some other classes especially the one where i've got an essay due next friday coming up um that the professor that has some comments on i'm not too sure about and then had to go over some test corrections for another class and had my dorm crew test which definitely didn't study enough for and i'm gonna have to finish my plan tomorrow but should have time to do that and lot of it is common sense it shouldn't be too difficult to remember how to do it in the moment so think it will be just fine and it will definitely be huge relief to have it over with and i'm just looking forward to actually starting clean up [inaudible] later in may um 'cause that gonna be lot of hard work but also really fun and [inaudible] might [inaudible] so that can get job as captain in the fall so i'm super excited about that and less excited about the tests and [inaudible] that are coming up although the discussion had today made me feel lot better about my papers at least so that pretty good today was pretty good woke up and had meeting with my professor [i thought it went well] and was happy 'cause got [inaudible] done [inaudible] credit [inaudible] which is really good [inaudible] class is coming to close and then had meeting with another tf who was super helpful in giving me some advice about our final assignment so that made me feel lot better about writing that paper as well because he gave me some solid tips um and feedback on my work um and then had [inaudible] meeting which was definitely really nervous about [i think it] went better than thought because they were really just giving me advice rather than um evaluating me too harshly um which was really cool um [inaudible] and spent the evening um going out with friend to dinner and then watching films and hanging out um with some of my other friends which was super nice [inaudible] [inaudible] buy ticket now to one of our formals that thought was gonna be able to do for free but turns out waited too long to get the tickets so i'll end up having to buy it now which isn't cool um but that just how it is sometimes so i'll deal with that as well and then tomorrow i've got to go and do my [inaudible] since didn't do it earlier this week like normally do because was busy on my normal like designated day so gotta do two hours tomorrow and then i've got plans later with some people from my sorority so that'll be fun [inaudible] [slip in] little bit but didn't go to bed till super late last night so guess didn't really sleep in but it fine um woke up and oh first went to pick up package that finally arrived that i've been waiting [inaudible] month for um so that was fun and then immediately had to go to work which wasn't too bad it was just little bit annoying because set off like fire alarm and stuff which was frustrating but manageable and then finished work and hung out with some friends and did get little bit of studying stuff done gotta [return that] stuff to my teacher tomorrow um and i'm looking forward to tomorrow night because it our house formal so me and my [blockmates] and friend are all going um and it should be really good time although we've got presentation monday morning that am little bit worried about so we'll have to get that done but after that it pretty smooth sailing into friday and then have my first final and [inaudible] essay due which definitely need to have started which [inaudible] um and then finish that tuesday or wednesday and study for my final [inaudible] thursday-ish but [we'll] see how it goes am definitely stressed about this final but feel like just need to study lot and hopefully i'll be able to focus and do just that because i'm sort of using this weekend to relax and party little bit so [inaudible] going forward hopefully can really focus for these finals because wanna finish out the year like finish it well off um even though know probably am definitely not [going to get] probably not even single but that all right that just how it is sometimes and then i'll be able to start my job and start making money because i've been little bit worried about finances recently just had some extra expenses didn't think would have so hopefully that'll be okay today was really good slept in super late which was nice because generally i'm not able to do that and then cleaned up my room little bit did some work on the project that we've got tomorrow morning um and then spent the evening hanging out with friends we [inaudible] party for the house [inaudible] which was lot of fun went to my other friend [inaudible] we had great evening so ended up being super glad that went um even though was little iffy about it at first but ended up having really good time think it one of the best nights of this entire year actually which is super cool 'cause i'm glad got to spend it with friends and i'm just not [inaudible] home which isn't great [inaudible] type of presentation super early tomorrow but think [inaudible] and then hopefully after that i'll start working on an essay that i've got due because it due the same day as an exam that i've got so i'll need to do to study for that and do my essay um [inaudible] enough time because both of those things are happening on friday so hopefully can balance that with also having to complete my work hours this week and um tomorrow night is really busy because of that another [day] [inaudible] going to with some friends and then before that have dinner that have to attend um so think tuesday wednesday thursday are gonna be more so my homework days but also normally work on wednesdays so we'll see how that goes this morning was all right had presentation with my roommate that was really glad to be done with um 'cause it was math which do not particularly enjoy so even though it was little bit difficult 'cause we studied late last night and had to get up early this morning and then we practiced doing it pretty well and the teacher said that it was really good so that awesome um and then got to take nap which was really nice and we went to dinner with my sorority which was okay didn't stay very long though because had plans to talk to my mom on the phone because hadn't talked to her about week and then to get ready for freshman formal which was tonight so went to that and it was actually pretty good was really glad that got to see my friend [redacted] we made plans to hang out before entering the formal um so we did [inaudible] lot of fun and my other friend came over and hang out with us as well which is cool 'cause he super chill and spent the majority of the night at formal with him dancing um which was awesome and ran into quite few friends while was there so it wasn't as fun as the formal went to last night but it was still pretty solid was glad went we got some really cute pictures and that big plus um and then came back and my roommate had another friend over they're actually gonna watch show so [inaudible] with them for bit and probably gonna [inaudible] soon i'm glad 'cause don't actually have to wake up tomorrow which will be super nice 'cause can not set an alarm and sleep in although do need to start reading my essay tomorrow yeah and need to potentially go to work although might end up doing that wednesday or thursday or saturday we'll see 'cause i've got some stuff to do on friday so i'll figure out what day works best today was fine woke up super late because didn't have to get up for anything um and sleeping in was really nice then didn't find the motivation to do anything all day which wasn't great because i've got two major things friday and then something saturday sunday and tuesday so got quite few things coming up and [inaudible] still really need to go to work um so it definitely been struggle know tomorrow need to [do] basically my entire day to essay writing [do know it's] gonna be little difficult because do have to get up early for an appointment and then [inaudible] um [inaudible] and [inaudible] so hopefully i'm able to [be useful with] my time [inaudible] at least so that can get everything done that need to get done and [inaudible] starting with my exam 'cause that probably the one i'm worried the most about but hopefully i've retained information over the semester and i'm now going over old problems in my old notes restructuring them will be huge help in exam prep and i'm sure that there are some sample essays that could look at as well um so hopefully it won't go too poorly um and other than that i'm looking um looking forward to dinner i'm supposed to have because it with good friend haven't seen in while and we normally talk about some pretty serious stuff so that'll be nice today was all right got up early because got an appointment um yeah that had to walk to and so was outside for quite bit and since got up early actually went to get breakfast which was pretty nice and got to talk to my mom for while which was also fun um and then came home and took shower and then had to head to some lunch plans shortly after my academic advisor which went okay mean it was just little awkward [inaudible] [inaudible] really good [inaudible] people that don't normally talk to but it was okay and it was [free] food which was nice came home and did some work on my essay [inaudible] meeting with another friend which was fun because also had to meet one of her other friends that [inaudible] um so that was cool and came back and [talked to] my [inaudible] some more which has been going particularly well mean because i'm not feeling good which makes it really hard to focus and do my work but um it should be okay think i'll be able to get it done even if it not exactly to the standard that originally thought it was going to be [too] but it is fairly long and need to finish because i've got an exam the same day so really badly to study for so need to go get [inaudible] my essay and the other [inaudible] on my exam so hopefully tomorrow i'll [inaudible] little bit better and can effectively do that because know definitely need to and i'm frustrated because just got an email from professor to meet to-to-tomorrow to go over some stuff that didn't think was going to do so it pretty frustrating 'cause it very last-minute and really don't have time for it and it means that may have to get up early again which is fine but also i'll probably be pretty tired since stayed up late working on my essay tonight but if just stay up and get my work done maybe i'll have time for nap or just get to bed at reasonable hour and study some for that same exam on the day of the exam because it not until the afternoon so i'll at least have the whole morning as well to study so hopefully it'll go okay because need to [inaudible] this essay out tomorrow today was all right ended up sleeping in because haven't been feeling well at all but um [inaudible] woke up and could barely sleep [inaudible] over coffee but [inaudible] had to [inaudible] so did that and did some problems [inaudible] so feel little [inaudible] next week [inaudible] continued and have been working on an essay since then which i'm almost halfway done with and is due tomorrow at midnight so that pretty intense have to go to bed soon because have [inaudible] tomorrow at 200 so need to have time to sleep and then can study for that tomorrow and finish my essay after it i'm super worried about the final but there not too much can do right now hopefully i'll do well enough to pass if not i'll just see what happens which just sucks because it [inaudible] all my finals but i'll also get these two done tomorrow i'll be lot less stressed 'cause only have two left and both of which feel i'm well prepared for so that good today did not go well woke up feeling even sicker than did yesterday um and have an essay and final today um so that [inaudible] wasn't done because i'm pretty sure my final [inaudible] my essay [inaudible] differently [inaudible] [later] and [inaudible] every [inaudible] but it was just [inaudible] [for now] um i'm just hoping that feel better tomorrow 'cause have an assignment [inaudible] and then another essay on sunday and my last [exam] on tuesday so hopefully [inaudible] feel little bit better even scheduled doctor appointment for tomorrow um [inaudible] [through week] [inaudible] and i'm trying to take some medicine [inaudible] [good stuff] [inaudible] and see how it goes i'm just [inaudible] since i'm [needing] lot of sleep 'cause can't breathe [inaudible] and even have [inaudible] headaches and can't think straight either but hopefully i'll get over it soon today was [inaudible] woke up feeling little bit better than had yesterday so that was good um and then finished some work stuff that was due and then [inaudible] on my paper that was due tomorrow although still have lot of progress [inaudible] just because i'm still [workshopping] few ideas need to fit into the paper but ultimately think it'll turn out all right um [inaudible] [inaudible] to go mostly i'm just concerned about how the moving is gonna go but do have lot of friends who should be able to help me and [inaudible] talking to my sister she might also be able to help me move depending on the dates and stuff it just frustrating 'cause it lot of work and it happening really quickly especially because move out and immediately start my new job um which is definitely gonna be pretty stressful i'm hoping everything goes well because like i've pretty well prepared for it but we'll just have to see what happens in the end i'm just hoping that it'll ultimately be all right um other than that i'm just really ready for the summer to start 'cause have lot of plans with friend of mine and we're gonna hang out um as soon as finals are over as well if we have time so that'll be cool today was all right had to sleep in little bit and and then had to go to um club meeting which was okay just took longer than wanted it too especially [around the] stuff that had to go over um and went [inaudible] essay [inaudible] managed to finish on time and was probably the least um the worst one that [inaudible] last semester which sucks but that was mostly due to the length requirement so guess we'll just have to see how it goes when get it back at least it done only have one more exam to worry about and that the one that i'm probably the least stressed about which is nice um and then once get that done i'll just focus on packing for my last two days before have to start my work at [redacted] which i'm really looking forward to although it definitely going to be lot but also it means i'll get paid lot so that fun and the only thing i'm really stressed about is [inaudible] what to do with my futon so might just sell it but we'll see today wasn't super productive study-wise did get lot of other stuff done and had meeting with my counselor this morning the last one of the semester of the year and she won't be coming back next year so i'll be getting someone new which is really interesting um and then had to meet with my math professor after that so guess that was [inaudible] but knew [inaudible] with them tomorrow and i'm studying for my exam before [inaudible] 'cause feel like that would be good use of time um and i'm honestly not too stressed about it think have pretty good grasp of this the material my teacher going to review few concepts and then in the afternoon spent the majority of my day packing and getting stuff ready to move preparing for my two summer jobs and stuff like that so feel like that was pretty good use of time as well um [inaudible] maybe should've been studying but will definitely focus on that tomorrow so it should be all right just really have to make sure to stay on top of everything in these last few days because start my job on friday and i've got really busy wednesday [inaudible] tomorrow and [inaudible] busy thursday i'm just really hoping that can sell my futon before then because otherwise i've no idea what i'm gonna do with it and don't want to donate it 'cause that waste of money so we'll see what happens today was pretty good [inaudible] little bit of [inaudible] night sleeping last night mainly because was still sick but still managed to wake up on time and do some studying before the exam that had today at 200 um which was my last one in this semester so it kinda crazy to [inaudible] freshman year to finish but on the bright side um i'll be starting my job on saturday um so i'm really looking forward to that 'cause i'm [inaudible] but also [inaudible] lot of fun and i'm still trying to [inaudible] figure out with the futons [inaudible] i'll [inaudible] get that ready for friday [inaudible] [set] i've talked to some friends about [inaudible] stuff [sorted out] [inaudible] so that i'll feel better um [inaudible] um i'm not sure what [inaudible] that have um [inaudible] still have to figure out housing stuff because haven't heard back from dorm crew or the summer proctor people yet but hopefully that'll get figured out soon 'cause it'll be nice to know i'm going to [inaudible] especially 'cause have quite few things to to take to multiple different locations since i'm staying to proctor the whole summer as well so i'm needing to know what gonna be happening today was fine i've been on kinda [inaudible] now that school over and i'm getting ready to move into my [jobs] but should all be all right and hopefully [i'll] just need to still figure out this thing with my futon and having little dilemma with the packing but nothing super major it just gonna be frustrating to move stuff multiple times because can't really lift things um but uh should be all right in the end just have to stay on top of everything i'm little bit worried about my dorm crew job which had really not thought much of until now um so that tough because don't wanna be worried about it just wanted to [inaudible] [really well and] [inaudible] but know that probably not realistic just really hope that end up making captain um and other than that just don't know i'm not huge fan of saying goodbyes um [inaudible] 'cause i'm just not as emotional [inaudible] i'm ready [ready] for those to be over with 'cause know my roommate gonna be super emotional and i'm not really gonna have reaction but that just how am so but it'll it'll be done with soon enough so will have the room for few days which will be interesting [inaudible] today went pretty well woke up on time and um had to go and move all my stuff into storage and helped my friends do theirs which was fun and then my roommate left which is actually really nice um because she quite difficult to deal with but she did of course leave huge mess behind so spent the majority of the day um after finishing storage cleaning that up and then [inaudible] to do [inaudible] training to relax for little while um so tomorrow i've got to meet with my some of my working people um to get plan because i'm gonna be restarting work on saturday um [inaudible] go for the next five weeks which should be interesting but it know it gonna be difficult but i'm also still looking forward to it i'm only really worried about getting some stuff moved into temporary storage and because my sister yesterday said that she gonna come on sunday um to pick up my futon which is the last day that she can get it so that is pretty frustrating because she has to get here on time or we won't be able to get it so hopefully she does though we'll just see how that goes today was pretty good got to sleep in for bit and then went to meet up with my fellow workers uh 'cause work starts tomorrow and we were talking about um stuff for our uh assignments that start next week which was nice because we definitely needed to get that stuff so that we were all aware of the plan what we were doing stuff like that uh so it was really nice to go over that um and then we um after that came back to my room got [inaudible] and then helped friend move which was nice because we had never really got to spend lot of time together um in the [inaudible] so it fun to sort of just hang out with him alone and even if we were just moving stuff to someplace so really enjoyed doing that and then hung out with another friend for bit which is [inaudible] the other room and then there more people that um my friend is friends with but hadn't really talked to them once and so it was also cool to get to kind of know them little bit better and they seem really chill so think we'll hang out with them more um and then had meeting this evening got to feel even more motivation such as where i'll be moving next and who i'm gonna be working with starting monday um so it was really awesome because now i'm really looking forward to it and can't believe that work starts tomorrow and that pretty exciting and know probably stayed up little bit too late 'cause of nerves and stuff but think i'll still get enough sleep and i'll definitely try to get to bed early tomorrow um 'cause i've got work sunday and my sister coming down on sunday for bit at least which would be pretty cool so hopefully everything goes okay today was good had my first day of work it kinda went well although it was really tiring and definitely didn't get enough sleep last night 'cause was waiting up for friend um and was trying to go to bed early tonight but have lot of packing to do rearranging so all of my stuff will actually fit um so i'm probably going to be exhausted tomorrow and am definitely not going to bed early tomorrow night either it sucks but it is what it is um and you know it won't end up being too bad so just [inaudible] and do my best am little bit worried 'cause need to wake up semi-early in the morning um so that can uh go over some stuff and move all of my crap into [inaudible] also on the upside if don't get everything moved can try and do it during my lunch break as well because don't have to be out of my dorm on time and my sister and her boyfriend will be here so they can most likely help me as well which will be nice also i'm not sure how much help they'll actually be 'cause they're really just coming to pick up my futon and then going um and that probably going to take quite while on [itself] so but i'm hoping it'll surely be okay and um so yeah am definitely worried but am looking forward to work tomorrow think it'll go well even though i'm stressed about it um and i'm sad to be [inaudible] on my first rental but got really nice new housing so although have ton of junk to move um it should still be really nice because it really nice housing [inaudible] again so that fine and maybe [inaudible] will help me move my stuff as well today was really good although extremely tiring had to wake up early and move all of my stuff into temporary storage and then went to work um it was whole lot of stairs so i'm [inaudible] really sore and was having to carry lot of stuff so i've got lot of bruises so it pretty painful but it also really satisfying work although was frustrated because the room i'm staying in was total mess so had to deal with that and um really didn't have time to clean it on top of everything else but that just what happened so um i'll just have to deal with it and looking forward to tomorrow 'cause i'll be meeting my crew and everything and really starting work so hopefully it'll go super well we-we'll see in the end um but think it'll be good i'm really excited so yeah today was pretty good it was my first day of work so got to meet my whole crew and made few mistakes but ultimately it ended up fine and got quite bit done i'm looking forward to tomorrow and i'm really glad that have the mentor and captain that have because he really on top of everything and helps me out lot i'm little bit worried 'cause my legs are really sore so walking tomorrow is gonna be challenge especially 'cause had to try and run back to the yard at one point and it hurt lot um i'm going to bed little earlier than did last night because i've got meeting at 700 am again [like will have] this whole week so i'm gonna try and actually get some sleep so can start feeling better and be really on top of it tomorrow um and make sure that my group gets stuff done in timely manner so yeah that basically all that happening i'm kind of upset because someone [drugged] my mom and she just has not been available at all so i'll try and talk to her tomorrow instead guess today was all right had my second day of work and my crew fine um i'm just not very motivated still and ran into quite few problems especially with [inaudible] supplies and cleaning few things lot of stuff had to be redone which was frustrating um but think we're handling it pretty well and have plan for tomorrow hopefully if can wake up early enough i'm gonna pick them up donuts and stuff um other than that i'm just really hoping that my whole assignment gets finished by the deadline know i'm worried but do have one more worker showing up tomorrow so hopefully she'll be good as well and then we'll have four good people and two mediocre and two not great people um so yeah i'll definitely just have to see how it goes and it gonna be pretty rough 'cause i've got [inaudible] people tomorrow for competitive jobs next week but was really glad 'cause this evening got to talk to my mom and she gave me some advice and stuff and think i'll talk to my mentor tomorrow morning to get his opinion on something um but yeah um other than that mean it work i'm doing it for reason because really wanna be part of this so hopefully everything will be finished correctly and on time today was pretty good and had work done but um got up early this morning to get my workers donuts and think that definitely motivated them and have some pretty great plans that we both set up for tomorrow so hopefully we'll get through all of them um and that really just matter of finishing up and everyone been saying that i've been in good shape and i'll even have another walk-through tomorrow night with someone that trust so that should go well because feel like she'll give me really good and honest feedback um and i've got assignment up the next week which i'm pretty excited about don't know we'll see how it goes um and i've been trying to go to bed little bit earlier but end up [inaudible] for while because all my muscles are also sore but feel like all this really necessary thing to do um which is fine 'cause i'm still going to bed much earlier than did last night so think i'll still feel pretty good tomorrow when get up and maybe i'll even have enough time to grab coffee tomorrow um we'll just have to see 'cause did little bit of last prep as in basically getting my stuff together than normally do but think it'll still be just fine so overall let hope everything happening everything going okay and can't wait for saturday once i'm done with all the stress and can just relax and probably sleep in mean there small chance we'd get work but most likely we won't have to and that'll be nice um 'cause this week has definitely been exhausting today was okay i'm definitely feeling burnt out now that it um only been week that i've been working lot plus hit overtime yesterday so feel extra exhausted um but it good kind of tired in that know that i've been really productive and feel like i'm doing really good job so i'm nervous about tomorrow 'cause it the last day but i'm also really looking forward to it um my crew has really shaped up nicely um i'm kinda sad 'cause two of them will be separating but think it will still end up being just fine um because our assignment is going super well so far um am basically just have to get inspected which it should be done by my mentor so hopefully it will go really well um i'm not exactly certain but i'm pretty sure because he been checking up on stuff throughout the week so know it hasn't been too bad i'm gonna be sad not to see some of my crew members again after this but who knows maybe will we'll just we'll have to see today went pretty well it was my last day with work for this week um with my crew and so it was pretty good but um it was super exhausting because worked for over 14 hours um which is definitely lot i'm glad that hit overtime because i'm getting paid really well but at the same time definitely need sleep um thought could sleep in tomorrow but then it turns out have an early morning meeting for work next week so won't be able to um but maybe can take nap later in the day or something also have to clean my room and help friend move stuff so still have lot going on but it should end up being fine um even though am getting to bed lot later than i'd hoped today was pretty good um didn't really get to sleep in like wanted because had meeting early in the morning but it was still fine because came home and was able to nap after that um and then helped friend move her stuff and ended up going to party that had been thinking about going to but wasn't sure if was in the mood but was only there for about 30 minutes and then left um with the intention of just eating and going to bed but i'm really not feeling well um so it been difficult to really go to bed um 'cause i'm having some issues feel really nauseous which is also not great because have work early tomorrow morning too um so i'm gonna have to get up early and um get ready and everything get [done on time] but hopefully it'll be okay and hopefully i'll feel better tomorrow i'm not sure what to do um but hopefully it'll just go away on its own today was pretty good started my [june] job um and woke up on time for it although was almost late because it was longer walk than initially thought but it still went all right um we spent all day basically loading unloading in science [inaudible] which was okay but it was kind of difficult um 'cause [inaudible] and did spend the last week [inaudible] um mm-hmm had to clean the whole house um but other than that when the alum started coming it was fun because just got to chill with them and take their luggage and i'm hoping that the whole week will still be fun um think that potentially i'll be doing this job for while um and they're and really like the people i'm doing it with so that awesome other than that my friend is moving in with me after friday so she had to bring much of her stuff into my room tonight which was fine but was also trying to get to bed so it little bit frustrating but overall still okay um think her living with me for bit will definitely be interesting 'cause will just have to see how it goes in the end today was pretty good had work again and woke up feeling rather tired but still managed to make it just on time and it was actually um the first [work] week here so that was pretty cool um then had good day [i helped] quite few people got to meet quite few people [inaudible] interesting and i'm glad 'cause think my boss really likes me um which makes me happy because [inaudible] now that i'm doing good job she trusts me and appreciates my work so that pretty nice to know um other than that i've [inaudible] for the rest of the week and then next week start another job um but think this week will be nice at the rate it currently going um just because i've got um quite few things to do but relatively low key um so can definitely get those done um and not be too stressed about it although [do need to] [inaudible] because was so tired this morning and [inaudible] today [inaudible] um [inaudible] [to and meet] tomorrow but don't wanna be too late because that means i'd have to stay later which is fine but not ideal 'cause do have some other responsibilities that need to get done [inaudible] tonight um other than that had phone call from my sister who normally don't hear from which was interesting and had to give her some advice but think overall it went okay so that pretty good too today was all right overall uh um [did] wake up early in the morning kinda sick to my stomach which was frustrating because had to work um so went in little bit later 'cause already had approval from my supervisor anyway um which was nice because definitely needed the extra sleep after getting sick um and then when did go in felt better and we had relatively slow day so so got to spend some time relaxing which definitely helped um and then the evening got little bit busy but in fun way um [they're] really enjoy working with the people and that makes when you know you're helping um so that was nice and got to spend time with some uh [inaudible] my class and people that knew from my job last week so that was cool as well um because i'm trying to get closer to them so it obviously lot and we have lot of um activities and stuff in common other than that didn't really get chance to talk to my family too much today but still did little bit mostly with my mom which was nice because always enjoy hearing from her and how things are going it was also cool because um got my or know how much i'm gonna get on my paycheck and it like made lot but taxes that are taken out are definitely lot but it still gonna be plenty which definitely need because need to pay my credit card coming up in uh just little over week so i'm really glad to know that i'll definitely be able to do that as well as get few other things that i've been wanting so that super exciting um and hopefully i'll get to go out with friend soon think work tomorrow will be pretty easy thursday might be stressful and then i'm not sure how friday saturday and sunday will go so we'll have to see but hopefully have time to go um relax and do some things apart from work and definitely need to try and make some time for laundry tomorrow so i'm going to go into work little bit later than normal but not too much so that can get off at semi-early time and do my laundry and everything so that should be nice we had work again today which was mostly all right although wasn't feeling well and had to deal with pretty frustrating person but it was understandable um because the person had just been having really difficult week although it was still frustrating [inaudible] [something] had to deal with it um especially because one of the other workers weren't really doing anything so they could have been helping but overall i'm still feeling okay around the whole the thing especially 'cause know my manager really likes me and knows that work hard i'm just sort of run down and tired and i've got an early shift tomorrow which i'm gonna try and make it to on time but also had to do laundry tonight and i'm just so exhausted that i'm probably gonna leave it in and grab it in the morning which means that i'll have to try and wake up slightly earlier so have time to go down and get it and everything um but that basically it and i'm looking forward to having break this weekend and may be going shopping 'cause need new phone case and some other stuff so that should be fun today was good day had work again but it went pretty well even though woke up feeling little bit sick um but almost done now and the only major frustration is that we had little bit of controversy over how we are gonna get paid and stuff like that but think it will work out fine in the end um although it might not be the exact outcome that we hoped for but something at least is being done um being fixed so that pretty good um other than that i'm pretty excited for my [job] next week and [inaudible] couple other people who [inaudible] are gonna be here so that pretty chilled as i'm good friends with them as well um and then we can become better friends as we all work together next week 'cause there gonna be very limited number of people who are actually staying here um so i'm really looking forward to that and i'm gonna have couple of people staying with me um starting tomorrow so moving them in is gonna cause little bit of difficulty but nothing too major um so it should be all right once it just finished um and i'm little sad that haven't seen my family 'cause [talked] [inaudible] today which makes me miss them even more but hopefully will get chance to at least go home for little bit sometime and see them depending on how much money make over these last few weeks of work um and even if [just get] to see them for like five days think it will still be really cool because just haven't seen them in forever so we'll have to see how that turns out and hopefully it'll be good 
3EF35,okay so it my first day um recording think it was pretty good day um had an interview today where had to present lesson like geared towards fifth-graders to some some students at the college for like program want to do and was really nervous about it but kind of hyped myself up beforehand and um prepared quite bit so was confident going into it and think it went well so after left was happy and um yeah kind of nerve-wracking leading up to it but part of me knew would do well and think did do well hopefully but regardless i've i'm happy that did it and think probably um you know gained something from it regardless of whether or not get into it um had like the meeting to get my wristband on today for this study it was good um pretty straightforward not really many like emotions that come from that um so yeah just kind of getting into the groove of the school year like still adjusting um there not really much stress coming from like my roommates or anything like that um they're both pretty good um um i'm not sure there there not much not much stress right now other than academic stress i'm worried that i'm like falling behind and procrastinate quite bit which is something did in high school and um was hoping to drop that for college but it like it hard habit to break guess just worried that i'm falling behind little bit um but i'm trying to get it get it all together studied quite bit today more than usual so hopefully i'm starting new trend there just lot to keep on top of and it overwhelming feel overwhelmed but it'll all be good and um yeah that about it i'm i'm uh pretty positive today so so it my second day with the wristband um feel like slept pretty well last night better than usual um like maybe like seven hours seven to seven and half hours it was pretty good um it was long day had lot of classes and that kinda stressed me out don't know i'm just falling behind in my classes and there things that need to be doing that i'm not doing um like 'cause i'm not sure how necessary they are so it just stressful and should probably do it but at this point it like too late for some of it but it like don't know i'm doing fine um and it just the beginning of the semester was in uh i'd say an okay mood today was kind of irritable i've been noticing like increasingly lately i've been quite irritable and um just like negative and really need to stop that because it like it hinders my um it just hinders me um and so i'm gonna try to be more positive in the future and like tomorrow 'cause i've just been in like shitty attitude and don't know why um and yes i'm just gonna study little bit more tonight had um didn't do much today other than go to class we just had like uh an orientation event um lot like mental health and stuff that we had to to for like two hours so did that and now i'm just gonna study like nothing that major um that it so had pretty good day today um it was unusually stressful at times um in the morning had last night had decided that wanted to switch one of my classes um and switch into another class it was very last minute um few weeks into the semester so it was stressful getting that all figured out and having to get the professor to approve that and now in the future have to catch up like in the next few days and so i'm stressed out about that having to catch up like for what i've missed in the last three weeks in that new class but also relieved because switched out of my first class for region for reason um and am relieved that i'm out of that but also stressed about making up what missed in my new class um uh also had kind of an exciting few hours today found out that i'd gotten to program that had comped for few days ago um that could ha had had an interview for few days ago and found out that was accepted to the program um and guess like they didn't accept many people and so was very excited to be one of the people that was accepted and um yeah very excited about that so that was cool um i'm looking forward to my meeting about that on um saturday and uh yeah i've been studying quite bit well not quite bit honestly i've been studying little bit and been procrastinating quite bit um social interactions were generally very good today had um quite few people um i'm worried that i'm not meeting enough new people and that just have like my group of friends that have now and that need to be working on forming new relationships with more people so that about it okay so slept okay last night probably for like um like about eight hours it it was it was good and woke up today and spent most of the day um or big chunk of it at least working cleaning bathrooms um on campus for my job so that was um that was big part of my day it kind of tiring um was doing it um think it uh in in in team guess or like in pair with someone else and we're cleaning the same bathrooms at the same time so was talking to him throughout it it was cool um studied lot today still stressed about catching up in one of my classes um but was was pretty productive was good at like coming up with plan and sticking to it i'm still studying little bit right now go to bed in like an hour or so an hour or two um wa wasn't very anxious today feel good and i'm looking forward to tomorrow um me and my roommates are gonna go do some things um in [redacted] we're going to go canoeing which would be fun um yeah pretty mellow day overall uh so slept pretty well last night got about seven hours um and woke up naturally and was going to go to work today um just like doing some inspections for my my on-campus job um and was gonna do that for like two hours but got really um just didn't wanna do it went after like an hour and stopped stopped that early was kind of anxious because the job involves like kind of pushing on people doors and bothering people and like uh don't know just didn't like it so was like anxious and like stressed out and just was just wanted to leave so did um and then went ca um canoeing with my roommates today and another guy and it was fun but um just had so much stuff to do like school-wise that couldn't enjoy it and it was was just very worried about like the whole don't know just felt like was coming off kind of weird all day because was so distracted or like my head was just in the wrong place or whatever so was worried about how like they were perceiving me today and whatever um then came back and studied for little bit um actually i've studied quite bit and i'm still studying right now am still trying to catch up on my classes it like have so much stuff to do um so i'm trying to do all that and it very stressful um had dinner with some friends that was fun the same group of people that usually have meals with um it was uh good day but stressful day and tomorrow is gonna be very very stressful so i'm not looking forward to it don't know how long how late i'm gonna stay up tonight but um ugh it yeah so have lot of work to do tonight and tomorrow so that about it so had um kind of stressful day today have class tomorrow that need to um get caught up in but it gotten to point where it impossible for me to complete all the work that need to complete by tomorrow and i'm still procrastinating um and it like there is just so much work to do i'm not doing any work which is very bad um plan of action but that what happening and i'm nervous about what gonna happen tomorrow so very very stressed about going to class tomorrow and ho i'm just gonna stay up for few more hours and read about um and read what need to read [inaudible] do do something and hope for the best um yeah so i'm not looking forward to that stressed out about that i've spent most of the day studying or good portion of it um other than that today wasn't too eventful had some meetings just for like clubs and stuff that i'm doing um which were fine little bit nervous for one of them but only very slightly and it was it was it was fine um got good night sleep uh no okay night sleep um yeah so i'm just very stressed about the class and i'm waiting you know very anxious for it to be over um so today was uh it was pretty good day not super um uh didn't really work very hard throughout the day um on anything but had was very nervous about my class in the morning had ton of homework to do for the class to make up for and didn't finish all of it in time and was worried that would it would be very obvious that wasn't able to do all of the work and that would fall behind and make bad first pre impression um but actually it went fine and was able to keep up with the conversation and contribute things and um it it really didn't need to do all the work to be able to to keep up in the class which was good so um that went that was fine um and after that had another class it went fine um and then um had to do like little writing prompt which procrastinated quite bit on um i've been think i'm getting little bit better and not procrastinating as school picks up but it still something that causes me lot of stress and still something that do lot of um i'm just very susceptible to like getting distracted by the internet and things like that um and then uh had dinner with like 12 people um because it my roommate birthday and so we went out to restaurant with him and and like said quite few people and that was fun met some new people um saw lot of people already knew it was fine it was cool it was very like low-key it was nice um and then got back and thought about studying little bit but decided to go to bed instead um so tomorrow have very busy day um classes and lot of studying so i'm little bit stressed out about that um yeah so that probably my major source of stress there some like social stuff that don't know i'm just uh [inaudible] i'm um hoping that i'm trying to just make sure that maintain all the friendships that i've created and that can be stressful um but uh it it good it good um and that about it so slept very well last night um think got like 10 hours of sleep little bit less like hours maybe um so slept very well um woke up at woke up pretty late um ate rel well relatively healthy today up until tonight when had lot of junk food um today was um was just kind of uh something had happened at lunch that just kind of threw me off and irritated me and pissed me off little bit and um just made me upset and so that kind of threw off my day little bit but um had dinner with friends which was cool and um so that kind of like lifted me up again and then um you know throughout the day studied little bit think i'm getting better at organization and planning ahead um and yeah so studied little bit for my classes wasn't too stressful today today went to switched into new class and today was the first day of lecture that was going to attend and um so went to the lecture hall and there was no one there and guess the location of the class had been changed without anyone telling me so that was stressful um and just kind of it was something didn't want to have to deal with and didn't expect to but it was all you know it was fine it was good day i'm gonna study little bit more and then go to sleep so had um good night rest last night and uh had uh um just you know went to classes that was fine um but had kind of realization today in one of my classes that don't want to be behind anymore and don't wanna like be in class where most people seem to know what they're talking about when haven't done the work which has be-been um kinda the boat that i've been in recently and think would be able to scoot by pretty well if didn't do all the work was supposed to do but decided that at least for the next week wanna do everything that i'm supposed to do read every word watch everything study as uh much as need to like do everything that the teacher wants me to do um and just do really get on top of things it important to start strong and need to get on top of lot of things so today went to the library today to study for really haven't gotten um haven't gotten to the library many times before here so it was for one of the first times and was very productive got lot done got just about all that needed to get done done which was great um worked on getting on top of things read an entire book it was um very productive so uh and uh as opposed to being in my dorm room which has been where i've been studying prior to today and that hasn't worked out very well and i've been distracted easily and procrastinate so think the trick is just to go to the library which is what i'll start doing um little stressed out today about some social stuff but we'll see how that all pans out um and that about it so slept okay last night um got like about seven or eight hours believe maybe bit more um but which thought was fine um and um had some classes today uh was little worried about some of them because had sections where was expected to participate quite bit and although was prepared was just worried about that won't be able to keep up or something so i'm little stressed about that and worried um uh other than that not much stress academically i've procrastinated little bit today but none of the work have to do is all that pressing um and kind of have problem where don't start work until the last possible minute and usually get things done um but even now that i've decided to be like more efficient and productive and to get done what need to get done find myself waiting until the last minute so need to stop that um and just kind of figure out way to so don't know just stop waiting till the last minute so that um what i'm worrying about today so spent five hours today working um in my on-campus job cleaning bathrooms um and did that with friend for most of the time so it was kind of social thing in addition to work which is nice and then um came back and worked for little bit i've been working pretty efficiently i've been definitely procrastinating quite bit less um and working on getting on top of things have just lot of stuff coming up which i'm stressed about um but uh i'm getting things together um have not well tomorrow have training for an extracurricular i'm doing which i'm kinda nervous about um even though know i'll do well but i'm just nervous about starting new thing so i'm stressed about that and then actually have to start the the new thing like officially um it like teaching program so i'm gonna start teaching on monday um which is stressful but kind of exciting and cool opportunity to continue something really enjoy so i'm looking forward to that also kind of anxious about it but uh hopefully it would go well i'm positive about it so just um quite stressed today because um just have so much work to do and it piling up and even though am doing pretty good job of keeping on top of things just have so much work to do and feel like uh have to put in twice as much time to be like half as productive as some of my classmates and like half as put together there people here that are just able to that are so much more efficient and think my academic background like my high school didn't prepare me as well as other people have for uh this school and um so it just stressful to feel like i'm always gonna be behind and that causing like stress and anxiety um which is what i'm worrying about now when i'm just working hard to to get on top of things uh um and it not gonna happen i'm not gonna ever be able to be on top of things and it just kind of really bad feeling um uh uh uh my time management has gotten better but still i'm just very stressed by academics and some special stuff but mostly academics that where the priority is that what i'm focusing on and that what i'm stressed about so had pretty productive uh pretty good day today um had quite bit of work to do um but was pretty good about getting it all done procrastinated little but do think i'm getting better um and um yeah so uh my my classes are are difficult but as i've kind of suspected the more time spend in them the the easier they are or not the easier but the more manageable they are and still have lot of catching up to do and lot of work to do and the work is never gonna subside but um i'm learning slightly slightly more about how to deal with all of it just so slightly uh but it good it in the right direction um and tomorrow have uh i'm gonna go in and teach some kids um about civics through one of the programs here um at the 8th-grade level and i'm feel little bit unprepared but i'm gonna have like an hour tomorrow i'm gonna go over the curriculum and um i'm excited but kind of nervous it all about perspective though so i'm just trying to be positive about it and it something want to do like i'm looking forward to it um and we'll see how it goes um and yeah that about it good day overall socially as well so had pretty eventful day today um started my teaching with local um uh middle school which is an extracurricular i'm doing here so went and for an hour today to their class and taught them some stuff was kind of stressed out before but when got there and afterward it was fine don't think it went very well like for several reasons but not really anything that was my fault or in my control um and it was fine um you know whatever so have kind of neutral thoughts on that and um you know after that studied for little bit procrastinated little but think i'm getting better um and had another little meeting for one of my extracurriculars um which was very low-key had um you know like said very jampacked day but it wasn't as stressful as thought it was going to be um it was it was fine overall slept well last night um and not much coming up um extracurricularly speaking but academics um are definitely piling up and i'm you know need to keep on top of it so that what i'm focusing on now or at least thinking about focusing on so had pretty good day today would say um semi semi stressful um at times but it was it was good overall um went to classes studied little bit i'm still having issues with procrastination but i've uh documented those struggles plenty of times before so basically the same thing um still procrastinate too much but feel i'm getting better getting on top of things um have noticed that if work isn't urgent as in it due the next day or the day of usually don't do it even though want to do it so it maybe something should change and um kind of excited right now 'cause just found out got um tickets to an event that really wanted to go to um so that cool and yeah excited about that looking forward to that event which is on thursday um with like yeah political figure so it should be cool to go to that um and yeah it was ex it uh exciting and it was good day would say so another pretty uneventful day today one thing i've been noticing is that um my diet is getting progressively worse which is big problem obviously well it not big problem not to be dramatic but like it problem so i'm going to try to like eat slightly less and healthy eat less sugar maybe don't wanna gain 15 pounds uh freshman year um and yeah had classes today i'm little anxious for some of them just like participating in class can always be nerve-racking but um that was it was fine um am don't know i've just been in was uh kind of irritable today um little bit like towards the end of the day um and just like bad personal like bad attitude um and i've been noticing that i've i've like lately i've just been wanting to be around other people less um it seems like and uh li um that that not good thing don't know i've just i've desired social interactions less 'cause it just like just wanna like don't know i'm getting sick of being here little bit it not big problem and i'm sure it just like my attitude tonight but just feel like i'm kinda sick of being here and i'm sick of being around the people i'm around especially um my roommates 'cause but they're the nicest people so know it it definitely me it not them like i'm the one with the have the problem ga um so shouldn't don't know i'm just getting kind of irritated by being around the same people all the time and just like even even the people in my classes it just like it getting so monotonous and repetitive and they just people just annoy me like don't wanna be around them and they and fixate on them and that causes me don't know don't know it just annoying to me and it like pisses me off and it shouldn't but pe some people just do and um like that think contributing to me having bad attitude and being kinda negative so need to fix that and just like ge-get them outa my mind um so um i'd slept horribly last not horri well not didn't didn't sleep horribly 'cause got enough got like seven hours but was so tired throughout today throughout the day like right from when woke up was exhausted and like could barely get through my first class without falling asleep and then like uh was yeah had to have had cup of coffee which helped little bit but had like lot of academic stuff to do today um and it was so hard to get through it 'cause was just so tired don't know why 'cause haven't been exhausted lately at all like since coming to college i've been pretty good but it just it all hit me today and uh don't know yeah i'm not sure 'cause did get enough sleep but don't so need to worry about sleeping more and like looking in my schedule making sure get eight hours and so i'll try to do that tonight so had pretty busy day today um but nothing like that unmanageable um slept good last night um got like got eight hours or so what needed to get um i've been feeling kind of sick lately but today felt fine which is good um and just went to some classes um not much to say about that it was kind of i've always got kind of nervous before section [inaudible] of my classes because um just feel like i'm not prepared and like everyone else is much more um knowledgeable and they know what they're talking about lot more than me and they just have background to the subject that don't have at all so they're like able to talk about things that just can't um and really shouldn't be able to like uh in terms of the context of the of the course it not things that we have learned it just prior knowledge that they know so that kind of stresses me out like don't know being automatically behind um and then went to um uh very prominent government figure who came to talk today um at the school and was lucky enough to be able to get into that get ticket to that um and so went to that and that was it was super interesting it was it was very um controversial and there was people protesting in the building um i've never been to anything like it it was just really cool and it um just like reminded me why made the right choice to come to this school um so that was really very interesting and something i'll think about for long time um it was just really cool it was kind of um just wild to be there there was so much happening um and came back to my room and just kind of you know didn't do much and i'll be going to bed since had long long day but um pretty good one so um had like pretty full day spent like three or four hours um working my on-campus job which is cleaning bathrooms um and did that with friend of mine um and always enjoy doing that just 'cause um it nice to talk to him and um it was it was good very low key um yeah always like doing that don't mind it really um and then went back to my room for while um okay just was on the computer for while and then had dinner with some people for um another extracurricular thing which is writing for the school newspaper um so had like meeting with people about that um and tomorrow have to go interview some people for story i'm writing um which is the first time i'll be doing that so don't know i'm not really nervous but it just like lot to think about and lot to plan and so guess i'm nervous about like the planning for it um but it should be good um and it was nice to to meet to meet other people i'm writing the story with that was cool and then came back to my dorm and um just like kind of went on the computer for while didn't do any homework today or any studying probably should have but should be good um i'll i'll do quite bit tomorrow um hopefully and uh that about it so had another pretty busy day today um slept well last night um today had to do some interviews for story i'm writing for the school newspaper um which was which was had three interviews and that was it was good it was my first time interviewing people so was kind of nervous but it was good experience and um there were good interactions um and th-then studied for little bit um but keep you know keep finding that am not able to really study until the very last minute on things and so like if it isn't last minute i'm have hard time concentrating so that something have to figure out um tomorrow have um have to finish writing in the paper th-the other story that i'm writing with some people which uh should be uh uh should be good um should be an interesting few hours and lot of work to do so i'm not looking forward to all of that um but that about it so had another pretty busy day today um um uh like worked just little bit more on wr-writing the article that i'm gonna that um was published today um but this it was published later in the night and uh worked on it early in the morning and like through the afternoon and so that was what spent most of my day on so worked little bit on that independently and then met up with group of people to go over my work and to see what they had done and and like talk about it and stuff like that and then later it got edited and published on the website um uh which is read by quite few people and it'll be published in print tomorrow which is exciting so happy about that um it cool that it all you know finally come together which is cool um and so i'm excited for the future and to write more articles about that and was able to meet lot of new people through the process which was cool and will be able to meet lot of new people um and uh yeah pretty good day procrastinated and didn't do much homework i'm actually behind at this point but i'll try to catch up uh eventually so today was kind of an exciting day because got my article my first article published in the school newspaper um so just seeing that come together was exciting and then went to teach um an 8th-grade class on civics which is what i'll be doing once week for one hour for the rest of the semester potentially the rest of the year um and was kind of stressed out before that because don't know i'm just having hard time connecting with them and they were totally not interested in listening so it kind of frustrating and i'm like yeah don't know never really know don't enjoy doing it but it'll be good for like future stuff suppose [inaudible] in the past i've really loved this type of stuff it what i've done in high school did ton of like teaching and like tutoring sort of stuff um so guess just have to get the hang of it and get back into the group and i'll i'll like rediscover my passion for it um and then had like another meeting for the school newspaper i'm getting stressed because like my extracurricular requirements are really piling up and like they're getting the time cons the they the time commitment is starting to conflict with like academics which is um concerning and something academics are of course more important than extracurriculars but find myself putting off academics for extracurricular requirements so have to figure that out um and then yeah so i'll we'll have to see about that so today got off to like not great start because uh slept through one of my lectures intentionally just [laughter] just skipped the class completely so that could sleep because was super tired but ended up getting good amount of sleep which was good um and need to just make sure start going to le to lectures 'cause missed one monday and i've been really good about going to them up until now um and was saying yesterday like my extracurricular requirements were starting to get in the way of school which is not good and just have to be careful not to put more on my plate feel pressured to like join million things and wanna join ton of stuff but just don't have the time right now so i'll just have to wait and focus on academics um uh was writing another story today and have to like go up to people and interview them just randomly um and don't know some of them were like very weird about not wanting to be interviewed and they so they were like rejecting the interview but get like so like upset by it 'cause felt like people were really rejecting wanting to talk to me it was like really it was kind of um don't know it was weird my reaction to it when people would be like oh no don't wanna talk about it um would get like sad and like feel like they were like just saying they didn't wanna talk to me 'cause they don't like me or whatever it was weird don't know and think about that lot and that kinda like put me in bad mood like sad mood for while which is weird to say but whatever and um uh studied or tried to get lot of work done we have super busy day tomorrow so i'm like not looking forward to that having to do more uh school stuff like ton of school stuff and then lot of this um news reporting stuff uh that gonna be long day and am looking forward to for it to be over need to get back on top of things that what i'm worried about um at this point so had pretty busy day today um had lunch with like an upperclassman that um uh she called like peer advising fellow she uh an uh lunch-breakfast so she like um an upperclassman meant to help freshmen which was cool it was nice to see her um and then um had class and spent another um pretty big chunk of my day trying to interview people for like another story i'm running for the school newspaper with someone else um and it was just so difficult to find someone and there was like lot of rejection so was rejected lot today and it don't know that helps build build thick skin um and then got story published uh that story eventually we managed to put it together um so that was exciting um tomorrow have busy day so i'm gonna try to get as much sleep as possible and um i'm worried i'm falling behind in in class and i'm not like need to start caring so so um last night like really didn't go as planned and well guess early this morning should say um clicked the button to indicate that was going to sleep um which planned on doing and then ended up seeing um like right before went to sleep ran to the bathroom and when turned on the light ended up seeing cockroach in my room and totally freaked out um went and slept like in in another area in our in our dorm room and spent all day today cleaning my room um like organizing everything like washing everything um throwing away every little bit of trash um hoping don't have to deal with that problem again it caused me ton of anxiety just uh yeah have like the biggest fear of of insects like that it just was like flipping out um and so didn't end up going to sleep last night until like maybe some time around uh 430 maybe um and got up about well about maybe four hours later three or four hours didn't get much sleep and um slept like on hard surface and it wasn't meant to be bed it was like sh it was uh very bad night um and so yeah spent all of today like basically just running around town finding different things that needed to like you know get my dorm together and it was felt like seeing that bug was wake-up call to like get things cleaner um around here and to organize and to like live more disciplined and live um in more disciplined way um it just creeps me out and it really kind of terrifies me just hate it hate there nothing more hate more than bugs like that um so that was really stressful and uh ordered some um stuff off the internet to kill them that'll get here hopefully um at some point tomorrow um but that was basically what did all day had section also for one of my classes which was like you know nothing really to say about that and then had dinner with my roommate and my friend which was nice but um was just exhausted all day long by the uh the the the lack of sleep last night so oh gosh we'll see what happens so um didn't do much today slept lot last night mean slept for like maybe like like nine hours nine or nine and half hours 'cause [inaudible] the night before last night had had really bad night sleep um and so just today didn't really didn't do too much didn't really do any homework or anything um studied um well no didn't study [or other] and just worked little bit on my on-campus job um and did that with partner and it always nice doing it with him always like don't know can't tell whether he like enjoys me guess uh my company or not and just feel feel like i'm kind of weird around him which don't like yeah do feel like i'm weird around him and don't know and then um came back from that at like 400 um had dinner with my roommate which was fine and um basically went on my computer for while not very productive day um but i'll have to get lot of work done tomorrow so had pretty um laid-back day today um woke up pretty late slept late but slept well which was good um had lunch with my friend uh one thing i'm worrying about is that have few very um had few have few good friends but i'm worried that my social group isn't large enough and need to meet norm new people and make more friends so that something i'm gonna really think about doing um i'm feeling kind of sick have think cold or something um and uh kind of was lazy today didn't do much worked for two hours um but other than that and then had dinner with the same friends um and so just wanna kinda branch out more um to meet new people and uh not very stressful day either so really uneventful day today i'm feeling little sick so like don't know it uh just something that happening took long walk which was nice i'm trying to be more fit um had lunch with my roommate and some friends which was nice and then just basically studied or you know was on the internet for the rest of the day didn't do too much um have to catch up with some of my classes um don't have any midterms which is good but i'm still worried about i'm glad don't have any midterms in the near future and i'm just worried about like testing and all that stuff and uh worrying more and more about like what my major is gonna be what wanna do so and then also worrying about like my friendships and uh you know should don't think have should have more friends than should uh like don't know yeah have the thought that most people here have more friends than me which sucks but guess that probably pretty common thought um so maybe i'll try to branch out little bit more so another pretty uneventful day slept really bad last night um and then woke up and i've been pretty physically active lately um and not eating as much as usually eat i'm trying to lose some weight um and just like be more healthy guess just really tired i'm very tired towards the end of the day um like i've had school off for three days which has been nice but i'm ready to get back into things um i'm just worried about school work and getting on top of things and some mid midterm that have coming up causing me some stress and also have uh feel like the friend group that was in at one point is like falling apart and like uh don't know just the stress of that wish didn't have to deal with but um i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to make some new friends which is stressful so had um four-day weekend which was nice but classes started up again today um uh actually i'm worrying lot about like getting everything done that need to get done it like mentoring time so i'm uh hoping i'm just making sure that get like all the requirements in for that and um kinda stressful um you know trying to keep on top of things um talked little bit yesterday about how like my friend group seems to be kind of falling apart need to make more friends so that something have to deal with but kind of just want like break from school at this point i'd really like to to go home for few days uh it not that i'm homesick it like i'm just kind of over this school for right now just wanna go somewhere else for like weekend and recharge um so yeah tomorrow have basically summer day i've been trying to eat more healthy and um exercise which is good i've lost like six pounds in three days just don't know don't really know why but why i've all of sudden like gone on like diet or whatever was wanna eat less just to see if can guess uh it kinda weird don't know so had another uneventful day today um slept for like an adequate amount of time last night but was extremely tired all day long so don't know why like one one and have low cold too so that might be part of it but like one of the most tired i've ever been so don't know what it is maybe don't know just don't know and um haven't been under all that much stress but do have some midterms coming up need to study for um socially today not much happened was kind of reclusive uh just like you know working on stuff and um had lecture today [inaudible] classes and then worked on an essay for while and um it just not very memorable day overall really you know not much else to say about it so not much to say about today slept very poorly last night but i'm up late today so don't know uh just during the day felt very tired but at night i'm fine so maybe i'm becoming no-nocturnal or something um i've been kind of eating less lately and exercising more but kind of stopped that today just eating unhealthy again decided i'd rather like be little bit unhealthy and eat food that is good and that i'm passionate about rather than like nasty like salad or whatever and like be healthy like know would just rather have good food you know what mean and so um there that and uh oh like met with some people for one of my extracurriculars today which was nice um he was nice guy yeah it was it was you know uh it was good day overall and just have lot of stuff to catch up on so i'm worried about that so today was very calm laidback day didn't have class today or anything um so woke up pretty late i've been really tired lately and so slept in quite bit um which is uh what it was good it was what needed um i've been feeling kind of under the weather lately kind of sick which is you know not great but um i'm still [inaudible] procrastinating but should be getting better hopefully um didn't really do much today just cleaned my room little bit and then um went to like meeting for one of my extracurriculars and then hung out with some friends for while um and then like just sat in my room basically talking with my roommate which is nice um yes [sorta] really not much to say about today it was good day and i'm happy and i'm yeah feel kind of uh very positive about this day and you know very overall just very happy [or] you know moderately happy guess so was like today was extremely tired again i've been i've been sleeping like for the normal i've been sleeping for like eight hours eight-plus hours lately like the other day probably slept like 10 hours on friday night um but i've just been so exhausted and don't know why like to the point where i'm almost like thinking need to go and see the doctor because i'm just so tired all the time like could take nap just could literally sleep all day long like i'm just so exhausted when i'm getting more than enough sleep so that big problem that need to figure out um and also i'm just like so stressed because have so much stuff to do academically and then also i'm like worried that my social life is kind of falling apart and i'm just extremely stressed and like [inaudible] just think wanna go home and like just take break from school for just like five days am suc so stressed have so much to do that i'm basically doing nothing can't concentrate just need to get my life together um and was extremely irritable today like towards the end of the day was just in the worst mood was thinking to myself like oh god you know hate this school i'm gonna drop out or whatever i'm gonna transfer was just in such bad mood and was able to like you know realize how ridiculous was being and like you know took some time to like write some stuff down about just like how was feeling and things that i'm i'm lucky to have and like wh reasons to be positive and so need to work on that but it was just the worst mood it was like such bad day it been really bad weekend actually um and i'm going to my classes with very little prep um which is not good thing obviously but you know don't know we'll see how how life goes so today was would say pretty good day um had class in the morning and then went to teach my kids not my kids but students in an 8th grade classroom in [redacted] which is what do once week and don't enjoy doing it and don't look forward to it but uh th my um partner for it is nice guy um and it it fine and you know it'll be good for you know just it good experience to have and it'll hopefully be good for my resume and and you know it it something to do don't enjoy it but whatever it not really that stressful um and what else did do oh had really cool event tonight at the institute of politics so was able to hear some really important people speak about world security and um international affairs and saw caroline kennedy actually in the audience which was really cool it was kind of cool altered bit um and then oh shouldn't sorry shouldn't say names um saw former first daughter in the audience which was cool um and then found out that with my 'cause also cover also do reporting with the school newspaper so i'm going to uh probably be able to interview really relatively famous actor through that kind of two-on-one with my other guy that i'm writing the article with so this should be cool um so yeah it good day and and have lot of studying to do which is stressful but it coming along so today it was good day um there were some things that happened that were kind of maybe not good but i'm positive um slept well went to class which was good um so some major like social things that happened um found out i'm gonna be don't know if talked about this yesterday but i'm gonna be interviewing like one-on-one or two-on-one uh pretty famous celebrity tomorrow um which i'm nervous about but also excited and kind of looking forward to it and it should be like an amazing experience or not well you know very memorable experience it something i'll think about regardless of how it goes so i'm i'm very intrigued by it and need to prepare but will be looking forward to it so that kind of cool and kind of found out more details about that today um and then also like met with some people on my dorm which was cool and then um just like kind of reconnected with an old friend today which is cool um but also found out that one of the people that had been friends with for while since coming here to college like was kind of not um not very nice person and was kind of saying some stuff about me and some of my other friends behind my back and just was like not cool um and so and then like she came up and and sat with us at the table we were sitting at like while we were talking about her which was weird um and so it was just kind of upsetting but don't know how feel about it yet um you know was nice to her when she came and sat down don't know how feel about it but it was just it was it was upsetting and was very worked up about it in the moment um so yeah that kind of sucks just like learning that someone talking about you behind your back but it was good day overall studied quite bit was fairly productive and i'm determined to uh do good sh overall so that about it so had very eventful good day today um went to class as usual i'm trying to think like didn't really do anything very notable earlier in the day um but was able to sorry i'm tired was able to um later in the day went to uh conversation that very famous celebrity was having at the university and afterward was able to interview him one-on-one in like private room in the back and it was just really cool um just to talk with him and got picture with him which is really cool and so was stressed about that but was more excited than anything and it was like super cool experience it i'm very happy today because of it yeah it was cool um so that was the most exciting thing that happened to me and then went back to the newspaper and brought the article and that all came good it came out good um and now i'm i'm back in my room and was studying for while i'm gonna go to bed so it was an eventful day and and good one so not much to talk about today um was in really bad mood and i'm just worrying lot about uh the midterms have coming up all the the tests the studying have to do too have huge papers and also i'm worried about like social things and like making enough friends and keeping the friends have and you know just typical stuff like that i'm really i'm extremely stressed out have like well don't know if i'm extremely stressed out but i'm very stressed out get like rash on my neck when am stressed um and that rash isn't has made its appearance so that sucks but um yeah it just not been good day i've been in really kind of hateful mood and don't know i'm just kind of in funk and hopefully tomorrow um i'll be productive and you know think was productive today but hopefully tomorrow i'll just have um you know better mindset and ready to be productive and you know problem-solving and just better outlook so um today spent the first few hours of my day cleaning for my on-campus job with friend um and that was it was cool um mean don't know if it cool but it was like it was fine like so that happened um and there really not much to say about that then studied for the rest of the day was pretty productive today think i'm learning how to kinda get in the groove go to the library and um i'm i'm learning how to be more productive and have midterm coming up monday that i'm quite stressed about but am just telling myself that if put in the hours will do better than if did not put in the hours so that my motivation i'm gonna i'm willing to commit over the next few days also i'm worried that my like social life is kind of lacking which is always kind of concern and it just makes me feel uncomfortable wish it was something didn't have to deal with so that also source of stress um and yeah so overall that was basically how my day went so think today was very productive day woke up telling myself that was going to spend most of the day in the library and that is what ended up happening so have midterm on monday that i'm stressed about but i'm really committing myself to studying for it and studied for um uh quite bit today nice amount today and tomorrow i'm really gonna buckle down and do hopefully ton of stuff so that what mostly on my mind um uh as far as social stuff goes today as far as social stuff goes um didn't really you know uh not much to say had lunch and dinner with my friend um you know i'm still kind of worried that i'm falling behind socially yeah so whatever and um yeah so tomorrow have to go deal with something which is kind of hassle like with my phone um i'll actually be getting new phone tomorrow but that shouldn't affect the survey so have to go deal with that like figure out way to get there so it gonna take two hours out of my day which i'm like kind of irritated about but 'cause need to study and then i'm gonna um yeah it should be fun should be cool no well not fun don't know why said that but like it should be productive hopefully so um uh today well the major thing that happened was that had midterm exam for one of my classes at 1000 um and was really stressed about what was stressed about it going in but think did good job of managing my anxieties um and think the exam went you know adequately didn't you know it it was it was just fine i'm not that wor-wo-worried about it really um and then had to go all the way into [redacted] to do one of my extracurricular cu programs and then the person told me as got there that didn't have to come today so it was like hassle to go all the way out there and then wait and then come all the way back uh that was kinda frustrating um and then had meeting for one of my extracurriculars which feel like i'm kinda falling behind and that that nervous nerve-wracking um socially really not much happened today studied quite bit um it was just kind of dealing with with other stuff so um today was i'm feeling pretty as go to bed tonight i'm feeling pretty happy and good um and yeah feel like it was successful day got lot of work done had dinner with my friends that haven't seen in while which was nice wrote an article for the school newspaper um and um what else did do yeah spent like the first half of the day going to classes and things like that um went to my lecture for one of the classes and that i'm in for the first time for like month so that was good it was like don't know just don't usually go to class for that class anymore except for section um so yeah there that and um yeah am feeling happy today and feel like it was it was good day and that about it so um slept okay last night and then went to few classes today um let me think what else did do um oh and then just studied for uh quite while um went to the library and just worked um have big paper due on sunday 10-page paper so kind of started thinking about that and i'll i'll write that over the next few days so i'm worrying about that socially uh not not much happened today was working for most of the day um and uh yeah so am you know and then at night just basically like chilled at right around midnight you know really didn't do much just sit on the computer so it was good day it was it was pretty mellow though um really not that much to to talk about but um yeah and not really any emotional things really else going on today so um today had another where wasn't very social just did lot of work have the big paper coming up that due sunday and so got um good chunk of that done and feel good about the amount of work did today did another short little essay for my my other class um feel like i'm on the right track and just have to keep up um so my parents came in this weekend for parent weekend haven't seen them yet but i'll see them tomorrow and i'm really not looking forward to seeing them um yeah just kind of stressful it like mixing of two worlds that don't really like um don't like the mixing it not that don't like them um and so i'm just stressed 'cause have like lot of stuff to do tomorrow in addition to like seeing them so it just like it become chore and have to uh like go to meeting and then go do some work like actual like paying like job and then have to like type more of this essay which is very long and tedious and requires just lot of energy um and then have to like read bunch of stuff and just have lot to do so it stressful but um oh and cleaned my room today so feel very accomplished with what i've done today so that about it my roommate kind of annoyed me but um nothing new there things are good it it good day so the big thing thing that happened today was my parents came for parent weekend um really was not eager to see them uh uh 'cause they stress me out in big way and had ton of stuff to do and still have ton of stuff to do but eventually like it was fine and had lunch with them and showed them around the campus so that was nice and was gonna get dinner with them and then like kind of figured out how to get an uber because it was like the guy was being an idiot and he wouldn't come to like the right area it was irritating so didn't end up getting dinner with them which was like put me in bad mood and then keep seeing mice and cockroaches that are really all over my room and it pissing it like absolutely disgusting and it unacceptable so it like so that big and then i've 10 pages worth of writing to do by uh sunday at midnight so it just lot of stuff to do and don't really know exactly what i'm writing about so i'm just stressed and i'm like it like kind of nuisance to have them here did enjoy seeing them but it like uh you know it i'm uh you know i'm just now realizing how like irritated i've been over the past day and i'm really not like didn't really see any friends today or anything like not many not much social things happening was just with my parents um and um yeah and it stresses me out so spent most of the day working on the sociology paper that have to write was very productive today quite productive would say um got like four or five pages done uh the quality of it is um you know debatable but um got it done which is what matters and then tomorrow have about like about two and half more pages to write um and then should be good so that basically what going on there um yeah so not too much to do there but just have lot of like editing to do and then saw my parents for dinner which is like nice but stressful and felt like was kind of in funk and don't know i'm just in different mood when i'm around them like in different gear when i'm around my family and they just they stress me out um and then just basically came back to my room and worked for while more and it like there lot of parties going on tonight um so was gonna like go out to one of those with um one of my friends but just have to work like th just have to get stuff done so didn't go out um and just like stayed in the in the basement and typed um which is what needed to do and then came back to my room and talked to my roommates for while which was nice we have like new couch that you can sit on and also like my don't know if talked about this yesterday but my room has like mice problem now that we've just developed which really sucks like in big way and um like it just stressful and don't want to have to deal with it like it creeps me out so um just i'm stressing lot today and like in the last few hours about blocking group stuff um and like who i'll be with next year um which doesn't don't have to worry well it doesn't happen formally until like february or march but i'm just worried don't i'm not really developing the friend group that would like to be developing and do have friends and lot of you know good relationships with people but just don't know maybe and and don't wanna have to force anything or really like work to cultivate friendships intentionally because that will just have probably the opposite effect of what want i'm probably just getting in my own head because do have quite few friends here but don't know i'm prob i'm know i'm worrying about things that everyone worries about or will worry about at some point um and then uh saw my family today which was good and they left back for where live and i'll see them again in like month um didn't really have i'm you know uh uh don't know wish they didn't uh hadn't come but whatever um but it was like fine when they got here and then um just worked lot on my paper again today finished my paper turned it in and so that was mean that was the bulk of the day um yeah and then had dinner with my friend so i'm just worrying lot about social stuff so um today um went to one of my classes at like at the section and then skipped the lecture from my other class just 'cause knew was like not gonna get much out of it and ho well actually the real rea well should've should've gone but in an ideal world would've gone but didn't go because was so tired was like slept well last night but then woke up and was completely exhausted like and all day long think it was 'cause took like an am cold or allergy pill last night that just like knocked me out and it stayed with me whatever so was just really tired all day long and then did like that teaching thing do once week which don't really enjoy doing but that like fine and whatever yeah so whatever and then um was just kind of down for the rest of the day and worrying lot about like what wanna do with my life what wanna concentrate in um like friend stuff is on my mind ton and blocking group stuff is on my mind ton and just feel like really haven't made as many friends here as had hoped to and the relationships aren't as strong as would've hoped they would've been as they would be so was not happy today and think lot of it is that my life is like disorganized and it was kind of mess today so just need to and also my self-esteem has been like it was really high for while and then like week ago it was just kind of it det-deteriorated so need to just like get my life together and start thinking positively and proactively and pragmatically and should be um on the up and up so this morning um went to class and then just studied for while and had to go interview someone for like two important people for an article i'm writing and really am like kind of dreading writing this article because have to talk to lot of people and like it just kind of awkward and um like talk to peo and just like set up interviews and like you know record people and it just it kind of uncomfortable and prefer articles where really it it doesn't really require that of me so i'm just like ugh mean ugh just really don't like it but gotta get through it because it like um you know just gotta get through it but it was nice conversation um and yeah gotta get through it so that can um and it it good club to be part of and enjoy it overall but and then um like late tonight had was just reading little bit and we had like little study break with my entryway which is nice then me and my roommate and someone on my entryway went to go see like little chris or halloween thing which was cool um and that was basically it um i'm still kind of worrying about social stuff but was and was down for most of the day but am pretty happy now so slept in today until like noon um and um just because was really tired and didn't want to go to lecture even though maybe should have but skipped lecture for one of my classes and then um went to one of my seminars to my only seminar to class for that um and uh today had to like interview someone or interview two people for an article was writing and always hate doing that when it like not super straightforward interview like when have to like figure out someone that willing to be interviewed and like ask around it just stressful don't like doing it um and so was like just and the guy was kind of terrible not terrible but just had kind of bad attitude and was like over that and then but talked to girl that was really nice so that was fine and and wrote the article i'm just glad it over that whole arti just didn't like writing it but like doing the um like writing for the paper just didn't like that article so i'm glad that it over now um and then dinner with my friends which is nice and um yeah i'm happy today so um uh not like much happened today really went to well had like lot of classes today thursday is like pretty busy day and they were all fine missed one of my lectures which like was hoping was like planning on going to but it just didn't work out it

i'm like happy it was it was good day um like not really much happened but it was it was fine and feel like super took um caffeine pill and i'm like super energized now and so think i'll probably have hard time falling asleep so it was like stupid move to do that um but whatever and classify it just like and classified the caffeine pill as um as drink of of caffeine uh like anecdotally so yeah that basically it okay bye don't know why said i'm like okay whatever so today really didn't have any like any classes at all so just studied for while slept in until like noon and then studied for while um and then went to like meeting for like an hour for one of my extracurriculars and then studied some more and then um went to my roommate had like little symphony like concert that went to and then came back and studied some more and um yeah so i'm going to bed now um so it was i'm just like really down lately like really depressed feel like social things are going really really horrible for me and i'm in my own head so have to just change my perspective 'cause things are not as bad as think but it also like kind of lack of of confidence think i'm just in rut kind of that all it is so need like break from from the school for while that would really be nice so really like didn't do much today slept in and then went to lunch with one of my friends and then um cleaned went to my job for like two hours uh which also did with one of my friends um which is cool and then basically just studied for the rest of the night and like went on my computer have like lot of work to do especially tomorrow so um was not very productive at all today but don't know did some stuff it was it was good day like really not that much happened um uh uh like had really difficult time remembering what did today when was like thinking about recording this don't know if that means anything but like for completely forgot which probably means that today was like not notable at all um so yeah and was like pretty mellow today i've been like sad recently but it was not as prevalent today guess so today just um studied for most of the day or like good chunk of the day um and then went to dinner with friend like slept in late so that why this is like half my day missing um because slept until like noon um but um yeah and then went to dinner with friend that hadn't seen in while so that was cool um

pretty famous guy that coming to [redacted] for the [redacted] so that kind of exciting just found that out few minutes ago um that like it could it could could potentially happen and it might not but

to sleep in and then like kind of was irritable all day and like got in fight with some people and then just packed to come home basically didn't study at all although probably should've um i'm just like prepared to come back and it been nice break but like i'm very very ready to go back to school and i've lot of things to complete didn't do any homework tonight and really should've but just need to like go back to school and finish off the last few days or few weeks um until christmas break and then things will be lot better so had pretty um eventful day today uh got up at like o'clock in the morning 'cause had to get on flight um at 600 am to come back here to college and so ended up getting back here at like thr um like o'clock 800 am um and then settled in and took nap um for few hours 'cause was obviously really tired slept uh only little bit last night and then worked for like two hours and then came back to my dorm and basically just studied and um worked on paper have that due this wednesday um so have like ton ton ton of stuff coming up and just need to like focus on really getting getting it done and being conscientious about it um and th-that the main priority and also like haven't seen my friends in while so it like gonna be weird like getting back into the group socially so lot of stuff to think about so um well first of all wanna say that this survey just took an i'll them the people this um when talk next time but the survey just [took out] questions about how classes were going this last week and didn't go to any classes this last week 'cause was at home uh so just skipped those questions but other than that um today was like my first day like back in the groove of college um so had lunch with my friend and then another friend um mean uh like brunch kind of so two friends had brunch with um and ended up like keep for okay so this is girl that like [don't] really like and me and my one friend really like but the other friend there was like um friend that close friend is like dating and totally forgot about that and so started talking about this girl and then like he started like to backtrack in like what think was the most obvious way possible so it was like super awkward but was like oh my god um so the rest of the day was like thinking about that but hey whatever and then had like ton of stuff to do today for my um uh new like class newspaper extracurricular um so was like had to go to too like an hour-long meeting today for that where was just like sitting there and then another meeting um and then had to do like some reporting and like reaching out to people i'm dealing with 'cause i'm like working on two stories basically so had to do lot of that and had like uh have nine-page paper due um wednesday and just basically started today but got three papers done three pages done which is good um and tomorrow have to do my stupid um like teaching kids which really don't enjoy but it the last day doing it so i'll be like just focused on the bright side um so i'm gonna yeah so it was like whatever that whole thing at brunch was really weird just hate that um but whatever it was overall it was like productive day and just need to maintain this productivity until december 13th when everything is over for the semester so the day started out with um me going to one of my classes which was fine and then had the last week for the semester of this teacher thing i'm doing where talked about it in the past where like go around here at local school and teach eighth-grade kids about government i'm gonna really really really really hate doing that like just dread it every week and so this was the last week was doing it in that class so it was like big relief so it like happy day in that sense then i'm like finally done with that 'cause they were just not just they mean they were they were not good kids at all but one like we were saying our goodbyes like some of them like did like come up and like they like shook my hand and they're like really sweet and like uh were quite nice um and the uh so but don't know still it doesn't make it it doesn't like indemnify this semester i'm glad to be done with that and then just had like had to do like an article for the crimson so that was kinda new um very traumatic figuring all that stuff out and uh had like lot of work to do for that and it wasn't really coming together so that was kinda stressful and then had just ton ton ton of work to do for this essay i'm writing and it not coming together very well and have to wake up early it and do it tomorrow um so i'm really stressed about that and hopefully get that in and um well hopefully get that you know hopefully it it fine and i'm you know hopefully it it all works out so today was monly mainly voted devoted to um academics have paper due uh today basically 'cause it past midnight um and had lot of work to do on that and so was able to finish that up so spent most of the day working on that was very productive it was like really didn't have choice but to just get it done and the quality of the paper is um uh lower than would hope but it is done and it edited and i'm ready to turn it in so now just have to um get up tomorrow and turn that in um and then worked also had like sociology thing to do that was also kind of substantial and was able to like pull that out really quickly um which was good and i'm going to bed kind of late but [inaudible] [it] could be later and um so was very stressed about that but mean that was like basically the main concern had today and not much else happened i'm trying to think yeah mean really spent most of the day in the library or in my room just working on things so had just like really difficult day um in terms of like was just really really depressed and um just like really hard on myself and beating myself up about things um definitely probably one of the tougher days i've had at college just was really sad today like don't know feel like i've been kind of drifting apart just kind of falling out of line drifting apart from friends thought had and it just difficult and just really being hard on myself about most of these social things um and then didn't do any homework today because was just like so much in funk and was just uh it was difficult day and i'm you know don't know had lot of issues and like didn't go to the don't know just bad stuff and um i'm hoping that tomorrow will be better and i'm gonna try to make sure it is so today was definitely much better day than yesterday for whatever reason was just really down yesterday um and think something that i've realized is that well first of all like the perspective have on things and if make the choice to be positive and like think positive thoughts i'll have positive outcomes or i'll have like positive you know mindset um basically just like the day ha like the mindset have over the course of the day is very much up to me and also that um the social interactions have are like really are hugely determined of the type of day that have so if like see some friends then i'm like really uh very ha like generally quite happy um but if like you know don't get in touch with my friends for day i'll be like oh gosh like you know things are falling apart and um it not really quite as bad as think it is sometimes usually and i'm anxious and so it just something that struggle with but um didn't do any homework today i'll do it tomorrow so yeah it was it was good day so had i'd say pretty good day today it important that just keep staying positive and remember that you know there are some plenty of good things in my life for as many as there are bad things um uh cleaned for while worked for bit with my friends um with one of my friends and then uh the topic of like blocking groups came up and that something really don't wanna have to worry about but um kind of mentioned it like oh like you know basically the conversation turned to like oh um uh we would be good blocking group with like few of us and was like oh so it was like guess i've been worrying lot about lately so it good to know that other people are thinking about it and that like there potential that i'm like included in those thoughts but um don't know it just stressful and i'm not looking forward to the blocking season so that something i've been thinking about lot today and then have lot of homework to do and didn't really get to everything needed to get to today so just have to try to like stay on top of things and stay positive and just finish the semester strong so there really not much to talk about what happened today just did lot of studying um and worked have an big essay due and so uh worked uh quite bit on that um and so i'm gonna have like ton of stuff to do um over the next like two weeks so just have to stay on top of all that and um so today was like little bit stress at the beginning because wasn't really sure what was gonna write about and then ended up like kind of figuring out nice thesis and planning things out so that was just matter of doing my research and writing the essay um and really didn't ha like socially nothing really happened today was just working in the library it reading period so the the focus is really on um on the academics and just you know like said helping uh finish strong and um looking forward to going home in about two weeks but there quite bit that needs to happen before then so had quite busy day today slept really not so good last night um and woke up well slept for think it was like three or four hours last night and had to wake up at like 830 to go to class that had from 900 to 1000 and then from 1000 to noon slept so that was nice to get nice nap in and then the rest of the day have big paper due several big papers due so was working on those and um just had few meetings to go to um so it was pretty good day was happy today i've been very stressed lately and so it you know um just really important that learn how to manage my stress and um everything like that um so yeah that basically and you know i'm staying up late but have lot of stuff to do so that basically it so today was pretty busy day um woke up and then spent like an hour or so in bed typing because have big paper due several big papers due and then went from that to like meeting for my for like club so had to spend like an hour and half at that um and then came back to my room and eventually went to dinner at my academic advisor house with two with my um with like few other students that he advises and like felt was like stressed while was there and was like don't really know them and really don't like them like that something noticed like was stressed and was like oh my god i'm so like felt like was being like anxious or whatever and then realized like and normally would like totally be myself self over that but realized that like don't really like these people and don't care like don't want to be like them or like to like fit their standards or whatever so it was that was kind of like freeing moment to be like oh actually don't care and that something that usually don't think about unless it was interesting to put in that perspective and then came back and and studied for while so it been productive day and i'm happy today and think it uh really important lesson learned that like i'm very happy being the person am and you know although may kind of wanna like impr like don't know i'm happy being the person am and should be little bit less critical of myself then try my best in everything so so um not much to talk about today slept in and then had to go to another meeting for club that i'm part of and then worked for little bit and then had to go to anothe-another meeting and then worked some more and then came back to my room and i'm now going to bed so have still ton of work to do and it stressful and have studying to do on top of the work and i'm just worried won't be able to to finish everything in time but um yeah just have to to really try to work hard tomorrow there mean the just have lot of things to do and so i'm very stressed and that is really taking precedent in my mind um was uh pretty happy today not much to say um to guess kinda feel kind of lonely but i'm not really that bothered by it um yeah so pretty good day overall just very stressed about academic things in particular so today woke up pretty late again need to start waking up earlier and um went and had lunch with some of my friends and then went to the library and worked for while um and then came back to my room and eventually had dinner with another just few of my friends um and then went to the library again and worked for while after that um had lot of stuff to do today which was stressful um academically but got most of it done um well got bit of it done eventually uh uh went out again to get some food with my roommates which was nice and then um came back and worked little bit more and finished up one of my papers and just have ton of stuff to do these next few days are gonna be super rough but um need to you know every minute counts and don't really have minute to spare so have to really try to wake up earlier tomorrow so today um just spent lot of time working on my homework and the things need to study for um that was the majority of the day um woke up pretty late i've been going to sleep late and waking up way too early mean way too late um so that should probably be fixed and had to just be spend lot of time typing and then this after like this night there was like school-wide like event in the the yard like that was fun to like go and watch and so that was cool but um other than that really not much happened today um it was pretty good day and wasn't wasn't really upset or irritated by anything all that much it was you know productive day and just need to make sure that i'm that uh continue to stay productive tomorrow it really uh just lot of work to do so today was pretty similar to yesterday um just had ton of stuff to do so worked quite bit um and still have lot of work to do tomorrow an enormous amount an overwhelming amount and it like my the writing have to do is taking precedent over the studying have to do and the really need to start studying and i'm just worried won't have time won't have enough time for everything um so this coming week is going to be uh god extremely stressful and have lot of stuff to do and it gonna suck but just need to like keep breathing power through do what can um you know and realize that all can do is my best and i'm usually pretty good at well i'm usually extremely good with handling like academic type of stress and just knowing that like i'm doing my best and whatever happens it i'm just doing my best um and then also like had little meeting with um for one of my extracurriculars which was like fine and then um what else did do had dinner with uh some of my friends one of whom haven't seen in while so that was nice and um then came back and talked to my my roommates for while so it was good day but just have lot of things to do i'm stressing about like blocking groups yeah guess uh maybe i'm just stressing about blocking groups because um have like one group of friends and i've thought hopefully i'll block with them and it kind of been brought up and now now like don't know don't know if it'll if it'll come through eventually and one of my friends says he wants to block alone potentially which is like ugh like weird and feel like all my eggs are in that basket and wish was little bit more social for that reason but other than that i'm really kind of fine and then my roommates brought up the idea of blocking together today which was like okay so i'll have you know few options hopefully um so we'll have to see it very stressful so once again pretty typical day just spent quite bit of time working um woke up later than should have i'm gonna try to hopefully wake up uh little bit earlier tomorrow um and just had lot to do and i'm not studying as much as need to be i'm just like writing um so have an exam wednesday that haven't studied for at all um but don't think it'll you know take too much time to study for it and um yeah it was good day had dinner with my friend came back to the dorm and there was like cat then cat like came in our room for while so that was like exciting guess and like literally very little happened today like have nothing to talk about was like stressed but like don't know woke up in kind of bad mood and then because little bit more positive and yeah so not much to talk about and probably having similar day tomorrow but maybe little bit more uh productive so had really difficult day today um just uh have lot of stuff to do and feels like won't be able to get it all done and it like the most overwhelmed i've ever been in my life probably and am being very dramatic right now um i'm just in that kind of mood i'm in the type of mood where wanna feel bad for myself um fuck this honestly have so much stuff to do and it overwhelming and uh so by today it tu so it tuesday morning and by friday have to write 15 pages of paper that do not even know what i'm writing about yet and have done none of the research and need to do an enormous amount of research for it so i've got four days to do that and then complete uh two final exams one of which have not studied for at all so i'm basically completely fucked and it not like i've just been sitting around doing nothing i've been working on other papers it like just don't have free minute just don't for the past two weeks like it not like i'm slacking off at all every second spend working and um ah maybe i'll be able to i'll have to get the paper done and hope will have time to study but i'm just hate this feeling and i'm ready for the week to be over i'm ready for saturday to come and be able to be done with this am angry and like under an enormous amount of stress and just fucking hate it and uh that it and i'm need to just find it in me to persevere and do what can and then get to that friday at 1159 pm and then just be like i've done what can 'cause don't wanna just shut down and have breakdown like already am kind of having so today was just extremely stressed out again because have so much stuff to do um and just was trying to get it all done and it was was overwhelmed really is the best word i've never really been overwhelmed academically as much as have these past few days have lot of stuff to do and when think about it it is overwhelming um so tried to get uh made the choice just to try to get one thing done uh did little bit of that have midterm tomorrow that really haven't studied for mean final tomorrow that really haven't studied for um so that gonna uh uh you know that gonna happen and i'm gonna do my best and think do know quite bit and it kind of something i'm i'm gonna be able to kind of bs little bit um yeah but i'm just gonna try my hardest and then need to write quite bit tomorrow and um yeah so when think it like i'm kind of in the final stretch and get that midterm done tomorrow mean that final done tomorrow no matter hows i'm gonna try my best i'm gonna wake up little bit early and study and then i'm going to uh get done with that i'll be out of that by 500 pm i'll be done with my hopefully my take-home final by like 800 and then i'll be writing quite bit tomorrow but when i'm done with that take-home final will feel like i'm in the final stretch i'll be able to take deep breath for minute and then do have 15 pages to write um over the next three days in something that i'm not totally well versed in but i'll be able to get that done and i'll have nothing but time for that over the next on um thursday and friday so after when get that exam done tomorrow and try my best on it two exams um one take-home exam will uh be able to breathe so it exciting that i'll be very close i'm close to the end of that and it stressful but uh i'm gonna wake up early tomorrow and study little bit try my hardest on that exam come back to my dorm do the rest of that exam do the rest of my take-home exam submit that and um take dep breath and begin my final assignment um so just about trying my hardest and breathing and thinking clearly at this point and getting some sleep so that what i'm gonna do now so today um most of or good chunk of my day was spent taking final exam had three-hour final exam which was like you know an exercise in endurance but it was like six essay questions in three hours and it was just really draining and think did like fine really didn't study all that much and you know did as best as could just like said would yesterday and so that all can do really so that happened got my final paper back for that course too which did well on um and what else um after that exam had dinner with friend and then went to the library and finished another exam had so right now i'm done with three of my four classes which is good but still have have pages done of 15-page paper that due friday so have my work cut out for me um and the pages i've done so far are not very good and the tf is very harsh grader so and i'm flying home tomorrow and like i'm not like haven't had chance to really pack or like get excited about it or like think about it at all and part of me just wishes had postponed it or whatever so tomorrow i'm dealing with that and i'll be at the airport and um uh getting hopefully quite lot done so that it so it about 420 right now and i'm just going to bed um and today was very busy very hectic extremely hectic day actually woke up and had to go to pack and go to the airport and then eventually got into plane and flew home and then had to come home and spend the rest of the night working as much as possibly could on my paper um got about four pages done and i'm gonna [inaudible] the six pages tomorrow so i'll be waking up pretty early won't be sleeping too much tonight it just too stressed very stressful and was irritable because of it so i'm just hoping to get that paper done and then hopefully it'll be getting close if i'm gonna work efficiently tomorrow and i'll do what need to do to to make sure it done and um today was really i'll be you know was tired today and irritable and it was not good day but tomorrow gonna be the same way and after that uh looking forward to just taking breath the end is in sight but still have ton to do so that about it so today just most of the day was spent finishing my paper for sociology wrote um wrote 10 11 12 like and half pages today which was quite lot of work but and it like wasn't uh uh very high quality but did it got everything turned in and um yeah so i'm finally done finally on break and able to relax little bit but just really stressful about two weeks now and i'm very glad it over and that basically just how spent my day

check yeah so i'm just glad it it done and i'll be able to sleep um sleep more than usual so today was pretty good day um pretty relaxed pretty um relaxing didn't really do anything academic or complete any tasks had such stressful like two weeks of uh finals and paper-writing and things like that and i'm glad to just be able to like take breath and do literally nothing and so that what did all day just like sat around playing on the computer and like really it was nice but still do feel kind of stressed because i'm still in like exam mode feel like um and yeah so was able to um just like do what wanted to today and it was nice and slept for like long time last night got good night sleep for the first time in while so it was good day got into little fight with um family member who

hate him and hate being around him i'm looking forward to going back to college so today um woke up pretty late and then just worked on some things and my grandpa came over so talked to him for while and then went over to my family house that lives nearby for while um and then left and didn't do much jogged for while um went on short little bike ride like not really that much happened and um just like said before i'm just so um my kind of hatred for my uh dad is just really extreme and just don't like being here uh looking forward to going to going back to college can't wait honestly um so yeah so today was christmas and spent most of the day um at my uncle house with my entire extended family doing that um slept really horribly last night got only got probably like four hours of sleep um and so was pretty tired throughout the day and um then [inaudible] bad mood and didn't really didn't enjoy myself but it was nice to see my cousins always like seeing them um and yeah i'm just kind of hating myself lately and i'm trying to get out of that funk don't like being at home it like toxic environment so i'm looking forward to leaving it like can't come quick enough still have like uh like four weeks almost um which is not cool uh yeah and so just trying to pull things together and [inaudible] so today um was christmas so didn't have lot of like obligations um so most of like the christmas like festivities happe in my family happen um on christmas eve so today was just like pretty chill day slept in lot and then like saw my grandpa and then just just got um money 'cause that all wanted so got some checks that was cool and then exercised little bit like really not much happened it was nice relaxing day though and always just continue like having conflicts with my family and just and it kinda sucks that like things just don't work out but they don't and i'm not really you know that basica that just that and um yeah so i'm trying to like trying to get more in shape and figure out what classes wanna do um next semester so that kinda what i'm focusing on and yeah that about it looking forward to what gonna happen next so um once again not that much happened today my grandpa left town today so just said goodbye to him um and then cleaned up my room little bit later in the day exercised um and yeah just kinda did few few other random things read little bit so yeah not much to speak of really today i'm still trying to to figure out what courses wanna take next semester and um all that stuff but things are going well yeah things things should be good yeah so that is basically it it was good day today i'm feeling good about everything so um not much happened today one thing i'm worried about is that one of my classes like the grades were due today for all classes and for some reason the grades are not out now so i'm like what is like why and know didn't do very well on the course so it like what going on with that um yeah and then i'm i'm not uh so like my sleep schedule like way off uh i'm just hoping that get that figured out and i'm trying to exercise little bit more so did that today and that good and was driving little bit 'cause still don't know how to drive so was like practicing that um and yeah i'm feeling little bit it just kinda weird have like headache after running so and drank water after so don't know why but um yeah we'll have to see so yeah um my sleep schedule gotten to the point where i'm going to bed at like 500 and getting up at like 300 or 400-ish um and really feel fine about it like prefer being up at night have nothing to do during the day typically because like i'm on break and i'm like very much embracing the idea of break and just not not doing anything not fulfilling any responsibilities feel great about it um so yeah like once again not much happened today um am glad to be away from school for another day but like wanna go back guess kind of but i'm like enjoying break uh enjoying having nothing to do and like zero responsibilities it great um [ever been] like at home with so little to do because when was at high school obviously had like million things to do and ton of commitments and so yeah this is great but um got back grade for one of my classes today and did well and was super like uh the final paper turned in was complete garbage it was so bad and wrote it in like three days and it was 15 pages and so was like god i'll be lucky if get in this class and ended up getting an minus and so was like fine i'll take it like very happy with that um and yeah so that about it so now want just to really talk about today once again um i've been working out lately and didn't do it today 'cause it'd make more sense to start tomorrow like for new year or whatever or today yeah tomorrow actually um so yeah i've just spent the day at home not really doing much go to sleep at like o'clock and get up at like 400 which like feel really good about like sleeping as much want like this is like the best month of my entire life just like doing nothing love it it so great i've never had so little to do feel so good about it and then um know i'm gonna like go back to school and be really busy but it nice just to have this month to like do nothing and like sleep as much as want and like just said sit on my phone all day um and it really nice so yeah that basically it so today woke up earlier than usually do uh you know usually have enough break and just practiced still don't have my driver license so was practicing with that for while and i'm uh gonna hopefully take my test soon and do as well as can on that then came home and ate lot of unhealthy food and watched movie with my family and then exercised little bit which was good guess but um don't know i'm really been hating myself lately for like physical things which you know is not not good but that just been what i'm thinking about lot lately and was already stressed about like going back to school and how things are gonna work there like socially and academically so like just stressed but you know uh very typical so not much to talk about today um scheduled an appointment for friday morning to take my driver test so that should be exciting and hopefully i'll pass that i'm little bit nervous about that um because it so last-minute wasn't planning to take it so early but looking forward to that and i'm gonna practice over the next two days and hopefully will pass that um don't know i've don't know i've kinda been [eating] i've just been like don't know self-confidence has been like not good lately and yeah um but [inaudible] is fine honestly go back and forth i'm doing pretty good and um yeah just looking forward to going back to school [inaudible] stuff like that so today was pretty good day not much to talk about um and so um just kind of just finished exercising little bit um so that was good um and then throughout the day i'd ride little bit um practice driving my driver test is friday morning so i'm little bit nervous about that but i'm feeling little bit confident and i'm just gonna try my best and hope that everything goes well and uh yeah so that basically uh my day um thinking one more about what classes wanna take when get back to school and um just kind of get little bit stressed out every time think about it like the social stuff and the academic stuff you know is kind of stressful but it'll it'll all be good and i'll approach it you know with positive attitude hopefully and and just like to make myself feel stressed out when there really not much to stress out about things are going pretty well so um basically have my driver test tomorrow so i'm trying to get to sleep early and um that at o'clock in the morning and so i'm little bit nervous about that but just hope that get enough sleep to be awake enough for it and hopefully do well but i'm just gonna try my best and if failed wouldn't be all that devastated i'm just gonna try my best and see what happens um and so today just did some practicing for that little bit and then read little book [inaudible] which was good i've been watching on tv and then wrote something um yeah so an okay day having some mood swings lately but it like very um very typical so not really surprising and um yeah just trying to thinking lot about what gonna happen at at the test tomorrow so today was kind of uh nervous and woke up earlier than usually do um for my driver uh like driver license exam which passed so that was good and was happy about that and then went to the um dmv afterward to get my license and that all went well and i'm just glad that it all finally over and i'll have my license don't really need to drive anywhere anytime soon but it just something don't need to worry about anymore which is good and um yeah just really irritated with my family and ready to go back to school so yeah and still like thinking lot about what classes wanna take having lot of issues deciding on that so yeah it don't know it it tricky figuring out what wanna do but whatever so today um didn't sleep too well and then woke up and went to go see some of my family members so spent the day with them um we went to like little arcade which was fun for my younger cousins and then um uh like we went to ikea so like not don't know we just wanted to see them and so we did that that was nice and always like being with them and um then what did do came home and just exercised for while which was good um i'm don't know i've just been really kind of like hating myself lot lately and don't know why but my it like my mind is just try like really like don't know it weird but um i'm just not in the best mood and i'm anxious to get back to school so really not much to talk about today i've i'm trying to like i'm not like overweight now or anything but i'm trying to like get in shape um so i'm gonna like hopefully lose like 10 pounds or whatever and then start like um gaining muscle so i'm gonna try to do that and um so that should be good and so i'm just like on diet right now where try to just eat very little and exercise lot like wanna hopefully lose 10 pounds in like two weeks and then when get back to campus i'll be able to go to the gym regularly so ate like very little today i'm like pretty um one thing will say is have pretty good willpower so i'm hopefully gonna be able to keep up with that um and yeah didn't really see many people today didn't do much family kind of irritated me as usual i'm getting into kind of conflict with them and i'm really like said just hating myself lately which don't think usually do when i'm on campus so looking forward to going back to campus so not really that much happening in today uh drove on my own for the first time which was uh exciting guess so that was something and just went up to like store and like not too far away for me but that was good to just be able to drive alone for the first time and uh and um read little bit today and i'm starting to was trying to like eat little bit healthier so that still happening and going pretty well yeah not much to talk about today um my neighbors are moving so went over and said goodbye to them and um talked with my friend for while which was nice hadn't seen him for bit and uh it was good day not really that much happened as usual um lately i'm uh enjoying not being as busy so not much to talk about again today um exercised and then uh drove little bit because have my license so that good thing now driver license so can drive on my own i'm still not feeling very confident about that but it good and i'll be home for about another 10 days then i'm just um i'm probably gonna be going traveling little bit tomorrow we'll have to see i'm not really sure yet um traveling up up north little bit so that might be good [inaudible] yeah need to get my hair cut tomorrow just lot of stuff to do before go back to school in about 10 days tomorrow yeah so still have bit of time but not much and have to start just getting things together for the spring semester have to figure out like what classes wanna take and what activities wanna do so um today thought i'd be traveling little bit today but that not uh didn't uh end up doing that i'll be doing it tomorrow maybe uh potentially but um so today just kinda drove the car around to like run errands for the first time um 'cause just got my license so did like um went and got gas and then went to the atm and went and got my hair cut so that was good to like just feel kinda like independent obviously at college i've been like very independent but guess [to do it in] car is um good step forward and just feeling felt like really inadequate today and like kinda depressed um but um then started to pick up and i'm just don't know hopefully just kinda get like this sometimes but hopefully going back to school soon will help change that and make things bit better just gotta be positive so today was another pretty straightforward day had originally planned on going up uh going on little like trip up north but one of my family members was sick so we ended up not doing that which i'm fine with wasn't too upset um so um was just spent the day at home the roads were very icy and it had just snowed so wasn't able to drive anywhere so i'm i'm just getting to point where i'm so ready to go back to school just because i'm really sick of my family and like do nothing all day but just like watch tv and then go on the computer and like like snapchat people and just mindless like stuff and um like there i'm just not doing anything anymore and i'm i'm ready to leave my family and to um go back to school and jump back into things so yeah so didn't really do much today either um i'm trying to think yeah it was the roads were pretty bad um so wasn't able to go driving so just stayed in and exercised um little bit which was good got into that little bit and um tried to you know have week left so when go back to school i'm gonna hopefully be more um like healthy and go to the gym more so um i'm like preparing for that so that the concern now and um getting little bit stressed about going back but don't know have week left so i'm not quite sure how feel about it at the moment but you know i'm always stressed about something always anxious about something which is guess bit frustrating so um today just was thinking on about the classes wanna take next semester and was kinda stressed about that and i'm gonna take one course that counts for two courses so i'm debating as whether or not wanna take three courses altogether um which would is the equivalent four courses with that double course i'm taking or um four courses so that something i'm thinking lot about and i'm also kinda stressed more and more about housing day and like getting back into the groove of things but think everything will be good and just have to go into with like positive attitude and um so hopefully everything will be good there and yeah about week left until go back and um yeah so just enjoying my final days at home and hopefully i'll i've been working out little bit which is good as well so once again not much to talk about um today am applying for freshman seminar course to take next semester only did one application and put like not much time into it at all so probably won't end up getting into it but don't know just did it 'cause might as well have something to do and if do get [it] probably won't even take it and so the i'm just spending lot of time thinking about what courses wanna take and um worrying about getting all the requirements that need to get in um so that what i'm thinking about lot and i'm stressed about going back to school little bit but looking forward to it just kinda ready to go back but at this point um haven't been doing much lately and it been nice for while but it gonna be good to go back and kind of have responsibilities again and to um get back into the groove of things and yeah continue doing all that stuff so as usual not much to talk about again today um am still sp-spending lot of time thinking about what type of courses wanna take um saw uh friend of mine that haven't seen in while today um who um neighbor actually as well and um was moving away so spent some time with him and just said goodbye and that was like fine and then um have read little bit uh exercised today which is good and i'm just excited to go back to school and thinking lot about whether wanna take the equivalent of four cla of uh yeah four classes or five classes so 16 credits versus 20 um i'm not quite sure what i'm gonna end up doing but thinking lot about it and um yeah so not much to talk about today um i've been trying to exercise more lately and just kinda got sick of it today and tried to do it but it didn't end up happening so like that was don't know just have to try to get back into that um and um yeah i'm thinking lot about classes wanna take talked um talked for bit to friend of mine from from college who obviously like it was just over um over facebook which was nice just like except for like been talking with um people from well not haven't really been talking that much with the people from school as um over break and so it was jut nice to guess touch like touch in um but i've been kind of enjoying the distance from college even though it been what i've been thinking about lot so yeah few more days and then um i'll be back so um didn't sleep too well last night but that was fine and um like i've said if an i've been stressed lately about figuring out what my classes are gonna be next semester um and applied to seminar that didn't think i'd get into and only applied to one seminar like uh the freshmen seminars you have like many options and just applied to one thinking wouldn't get in and then ended up actually getting into it which is good guess but it think wou it was um just like lot of contemplating whether or not wanted to take it and um do think so i've just done lot of [inaudible] today whether wanted to take another seminar um in addition to the uh 16 credits that i'll already be taking um so yes it was just something had to think about but think um you know it all hopefully gonna come together nicely um so today was pretty good day was able to get some chores done around the house i'm leaving um i've leaving soon to go back to college so um just am trying to get them some things done and uh met friend of mine that haven't seen in months at um at restaurant and saw her for while which was nice then came home and and did some more things so i'm just in the process of packing and and i'm getting ready to going back to school which is stressful because have lot of stuff to do and um yeah just kind of stressful but it hopefully will all come together and you know it will and um and just very soon i'll be back in the swing of things and and figuring out what want to do for the semester and uh things like that so i'm looking forward to just kind of getting back in the groove so today was very busy day um in that was uh packing all day 'cause i'm flying back tomorrow um well guess today now and it was just really busy like last-minute stuff um to make sure that i'd gotten everything that needed to get done done on time and all that stuff and so just stressed not that got like everything packed 'cause packed in like three hours and was like 'cause it was the past three hours i've just been packing so just don't know didn't get to it for while um and uh so was stressed about that but i'm excited to go back um going on the plane tomorrow and then getting back with the groove of things being back on campus and just kind of starting the second semester uh um yeah so i'm just always kind of neurotic about packing and hoping get everything and right now i'm thinking about things that might have forgotten so i'm gonna try to go to bed soon but yeah just have lot of lot of stuff to think about so i'm back um at uh on campus after winter break um uh flew back today woke up pretty early and flew back and back on campus so that good and was nervous coming back was very stressed to come back but when got here saw my roommate and that was nice and went to meeting which already had to go to which was annoying and then uh saw some of my friends which was good yeah so good first day back um it gonna be good semester it gonna be great semester i'm looking forward to the [shopping] classes and figuring out what wanna take um and it that gonna start tomorrow so looking forward to that and um yeah just little stressed about housing day was brought up um brought up by someone today to me um [inaudible] just the like the politics of blocking can be stressful but i'm hoping it goes smoothly and uh was talking to my roommate about it which was good and then think have couple other friends [inaudible] but we'll have to see so you know whatever had you know it doesn't really matter that much to me but still we'll just see so um today was pretty good day uh it was the first day of the semester so was shopping few classes um and things went pretty well there was um quite nervous today for some of my classes um took language course um and so the first day of that was bit intense and i'm just thinking lot about whether or not wanna take that course um for the semester and then had dinner with some of my friends that haven't seen um in like five weeks since before break um so that was nice and then my roommate came back and we uh kind of switched our rooms around and talked for while which was good and that was about it i'm just it was good day but i'm pretty stressed about um figuring out what classes have to take and and social stuff and and everything like that so um lot to figure out but i'm gonna try to just keep you know keep shopping classes tomorrow and and see what like and see how it all goes um so today was there was lot going on today actually like um well woke up and went to some classes then um shopping and i'm considering taking [inaudible] course and bought the textbook for it and just returned the textbook and now i'm thinking oh maybe should go back and get the textbook and take the course again don't really know i'm i'm just contemplating 'cause um it very nerve racking but like the idea of don't know just have to think about it so maybe i'll go tomorrow or maybe won't and um then was just kinda depressed for some of the day for reasons can't really understand just felt very my mind felt very disorganized and chaotic um and you know didn't go out with didn't go to dinner with any friends just like stayed in and don't know was kinda depressed today and then friend texted me about whether he wanted to whether wanted to block with him and few of my other friends which is what kinda had been hoping would happen and said yes so that might be happening i'm not really sure there but that kinda got me excited um because of course blocking is something stressful so just to kinda be uh done with it or have an idea of what gonna end up happening would be good and uh yeah class schedule still stressing me out but and i'm gonna try to go exercising uh tomorrow morning so i'm going to sleep early um so that about it so um yeah today was don't know uh kind of an interesting day um uh um uh sorry about the background noise but i'm i'm i'm away from them uh went to class today this morning wasn't totally sure what courses wanted to take um but think i've kind of settled into that and and german is still um but it it an an intensive course so that kinda stressful and then um met with my academic adviser and that was nice meeting and then went to course with my friend and had dinner with him then after dinner it was just like don't know tend to kind of hate myself after like one-on-one social interactions and it don't know that can be kind of awkward don't know yeah just like beat myself up over it and it been something that like happening increasingly which don't really understand uh because talk with plenty of people have plenty of friends but that something i've kind of been noticing uh more and more frequently um i'm just kinda making up things in my head so that kinda shitty but whatever so today um woke up as usual at you know 700 uh late late 700 early 800 don't quite remember um to go to my o'clock course which have every day of the week and went to that course and i'm always kind of it language course it german so there lot of like on the spot like you're called on you have to know stuff and how to say things and i'm not quite good at stuff like that um so that stressful and i'm always kinda embarrassed and know it not super justified but just 'cause it it who cares but yeah so have to study lot for that and then came back to my room and just kinda feeling like not even depressed but just like wanted like you know i'm transitioning back to college from being at home for five weeks and it was like just wanted like day to like kinda be alone and so just like spent the day like in my room um good part of the day in my room uh like watching tv and like um like going on the internet and just kinda like relaxing like talking to my friends back in [redacted] like on the phone and just doing things that like um that kinda made me happy and we're not like connecting with lot of people here um at school where am now um so that was that was good and then was just like yeah really wasn't depressed wasn't sad but just like needed that time alone and so that was good to kinda recharge and um do nothing for while and then ended up going to dinner with one of my friends and then we saw another friend and then it turned into kind of bigger thing where we um there this little bonfire outside so we talked for like like probably like three hours or two hours maybe um by the bonfire then played ping pong and then just like walked around bit and we talked little biout about blocking gro-groups um so it was like it was mores more than expected and saw lot of people um so that was good to kinda like don't know after being kinda couped up inside it was like it good to to do that so yeah it was kind of big day in in the sense that kinda went from being in hall around nobody to being with few people so yeah that about it so um the past day like this day really did um just stayed in my room almost the entire day and studied for my german course it an extremely like i'm starting to realize how intensive of course it is and how much how demanding it is and so basically just kinda studied all day today in what was what was necessary to to even keep up and even now have lot more work to do so it you know stressful but knew i'd just stay in today and that was fine and so just did that and studied all day and then procrastinated bit which is frustrating kind of had like breakdown like oh can't do it can't handle it and then took deep breath and just really like kind of committed to studying for few hours um and made some good progress and i'm feeling bit more positive about things now but it just gonna be difficult semester and i'm trying to take extra additional extracurriculars um on top of that and it like can't even handle the extracurriculars was already doing with this academic load and um so i'm just kinda frustrated about that frustrated about the implications that my academics and extracurriculars have for the future things like that and wasn't worried about anything outside of academics today that was kinda the focus today didn't really talk to any of my friends didn't uh guess left the room like once or twice like ugh was just studying and um yeah so that that and how i'll probably be doing some other thing tomorrow so uh yeah i'm we'll see how things go so once again spent good por-portion of my day um studying for german and then studied bit for some of my other courses um and then oh had meeting for one of my extracurriculars and so that like added pressure something just really need to work on um and then um had dinner with some of my friends and one of whom hadn't seen in while so it was cool to catch up with him and then came back to my room and studied little bit more um like said i'm just gonna have to to study lot for this german course in addition to the three other courses that i'm taking so it gonna be busy semester but think can handle it and made some progress this weekend and um it just about studying and and being confident and those are two things need to work on and should be able to grow lot from from the course and it it not like anything i've taken before but just gotta like said be confident and study and um hopefully can handle it know can so um not much to talk about today woke up at like the normal time like o'clock about and then um uh went to my german course which is an hour long um and that it went well i'm getting like more confident with it which is good but it still like lot of work and then um what did do came back to my room for bit and then had another course and then another course and um my third course have with my friend [redacted] so like we went uh together and it just guess good to have course um with friend and then have like so that like two hours and then oh had to interview someone for an article was writing and then wrote the article um and it was just lot to do but it was fine and then studied little bit more and uh had dinner with some of my friends who haven't seen in while which is nice and uh yeah it was busy day but it all went well so have quiz tomorrow in my german class so spent most of today studying for that i'm bit nervous about it but i'm hoping it it all goes well and um yeah so that tomorrow morning and um yeah i'm feeling okay about it and so spent just most of the day studying for that and um didn't really see anyone do anything socially really think about anything but the quiz um and had uh german in the morning and then had my expository writing course um and that was good it was my first day of that course and the teacher seems nice and the conversation was like interesting so um i'm looking forward to to being part of that course and um yeah so just focusing lot on that quiz tomorrow and hoping for the best i'm gonna try to study little bit more tonight and then and then go to bed and um you know hope everything goes well so that about it so um today was overall pretty good day think i'm getting little bit sick um so that guess not great but should just be little bit of cold um had german test this morning and was very nervous about it but it seemed like everyone was nervous about it and don't think did too good um which is guess disappointing but uh sounded like no one else was really confident how they did so we'll just um kind of have to see how it goes and then ran into one of my friends at lunch two of my friends actually one of whom hadn't seen in while so it was nice to talk with him um and then just basically spent the rest of the day in my room and like said feel like i'm getting little bit sick so trying to just relax and studied bit um but not much to say pretty good day got some applications done for some extracurriculars want to do this semester so um not totally unproductive day either so um today was another busy day had my early class that have to go to um five days week at 900 am so had that um and it been good guess to get up early um and i'm worrying that i'm not gonna be able to keep up with it but just have to keep keep committing to studying and and things like that um and then came back to my room for bit had another class that went well and then eventually had to go and had um an article wrote um for the school newspaper that took like an hour and then had another class um and then what did do just came back to my room and um studied for bit and then had nice conversation with my roommates and uh yeah that about it it was um you know an okay day not much to discuss uh so today was pretty good day um had class in the morning for two hours and then went to get lunch and um then went then worked for while have have job cleaning things on campus and so did that with my friend for like two hours which was nice to talk to him for while um and then uh studied more for while and um went back to my room and uh and had dinner with one of my friends and um both of my roommates have their girlfriends over tonight so it kind of awkward just being in the room so i'm i'm sleeping like in the common [inaudible] area and don't know it just kind of irritating but it fine and uh oh and worked little bit more um just on homework and stuff and uh yeah so was good day so today um woke up pretty early and worked for bit and then had meeting and then worked bit more at um at my on-campus job and studied for while and ate meals with my friends and uh told to stay away from my room 'cause both my roommates had their girlfriends over um which which is guess kind of annoying just because have to sleep on the couch but it fine don't mind it too much um yeah so don't know i'm just really tired and thinking lot about what have to do in the morning and it just gonna be busy semester and i'm wondering if should drop one of my courses or just take it pass or fail so that something i'm thinking lot about too and uh yeah so we'll have to see uh so today was pretty pretty good day overall um slept in the bed which is good i've been staying up or i'm kind of getting up pretty early lately so it nice to sleep in this morning and was sleeping on the couch in our room because uh both my roommates had their girlfriends over um or actually no one of my roommates' girlfriend left but um the one that i'm rooming with in the bedroom had his girlfriend over so had to sleep on the couch for two days which was which was fine uh didn't mind it all too much but stayed out of the room for most of the day just so that you know they could have their space so that was guess you know whatever mean it was fine it was fine and um just studied lot today had an issue with kind of procrastinating and and not not getting everything done that needed to get done in the in the time period but ended up getting quite bit done and and so that good and um had meeting today for one of my extracurriculars which was fine and uh one thing i'm kind of stressed about is that tomorrow i'm starting new program where volunteer with kids in like an inner-city area that live in like government housing and um figured out the names of the kids that i'll be working with today and one of my friends who did it last semester told me that they're like are just not not good kids and that they're probably gonna give me lot of trouble so that concerning me and i'm ugh don't know because wanted to do three things this semester so think what might do is um go tomorrow try to be as positive about it as possible and and hope that they're good um and i'm and i'm sure i'll be able to kind of work with them and i'm sure it'll go fine but if it doesn't have to debate uh trying to find something else um so that uh stressful thing to have to worry about but i'm i'm gonna try to just make sure that that it all goes well so today was very active day probably one of the busiest days had i've had um all year got up early as usual for my german course and then had to run and prepare for meeting had with my teacher from one of my courses that completely forgot about and then had another course for an hour and then had um uh an an hour off where had lunch with some friends and then had another course for two hours and then immediately from that went to volunteer program for my first time and actually really enjoyed that but it was just lot of work and then after that came back and had dinner and uh went and just spent the last like four hours at my at another extracurricular doing like night editing shift for the paper so it was stressful day and i'm super tired and kind of worried about how i'm gonna be able to function tomorrow but i'm gonna go to bed so um hi sorry just had to walk into private location but um just let me think what did today um didn't sleep too much last night got into my dorm pretty late and then had to wake up and go to my german course which kind of embarrassed myself at and then had [inaudible] writing course which um really enjoy so that was nice and then um had an interview for an program that might be part of over the summer and that was kind of stressful and don't know don't really know how felt about how did but was stressed out about it bit but think managed the stress quite well um and then studied for bit at the library had dinner with um few of my friends which was nice um blocking things seem to be settling out maybe which which is good hope there no last-minute drama and uh it was good day so um woke up at like 750 today and went to my german ca class which have every day and that went well was like debating not going just because yesterday kind of embarrassed myself and wanted to study more um but went to that today and it went well and then had another course which was just was super tired today because only slept for like six hours for the past two nights um and so actually yeah yeah so need to get to bed but um so that course was like kind of don't know was zoned out and didn't do thing and still haven't done any of the readings in that course so that kind of stressful then blah blah blah studied and then um uh had dinner with uh two of my friends and my roommate who haven't seen in while um and uh and it was good day yeah was kind of stressed as usual um this german course is big commitment but it was good day aft overall and i'm feeling very positive so um today was pretty good day i'm very stressed out right now because we just saw mouse in our room after seeing many mice in our room and thinking the problem was deal was dealt with so um that horrible and i'm just stressed about it and pissed off at my uh roommates kind of and um but it it just as much my fault honestly so i'm just being weird and um so uh it was busy day and procrastinated lot when shouldn't have um um [contrived] like brilliant study for my german test tomorrow then have another busy day tomorrow so just have lot of of stuff to do and it constant i'm considering dropping one of my courses and it something i'll have to consider little bit more before monday and um [inaudible] just had busy day with lot of stuff academic and uh extracurricular and social and it was busy and things were good but this is bad way to end the day and i'm so just pissed like whatever so today was another pretty busy day had class for two hours in the morning german class and um it was had quiz and that went okay not great maybe even not okay but i'm moving on with my life and then had section and it was for my political science course and realized in that course how little liked political science how little liked social science in general and it was just kind of like an awakening moment like oh my god should not be studying what thought was gonna be studying and then it was like should do premed because like the idea of being doctor know i'd be good doctor and like interacting with people when i'm in position of authority so was like maybe i'll be premed so looked into that and um will not be gov concentrator will not be sociology concentrator or uh an economics or social science concentrator in general social studies either uh so that that was big development for the day it was just like like just realized that the course like fucking hate when i'm learning so that was interesting and uh and then so i'll probably do humanities or uh premed maybe uh but think do still probably i'm going to enjoy law school just don't like don't like uh oh shit is it that don't like science and then probably shouldn't be premed don't know i've still gotta figure some stuff out don't like social science so we'll have to see so today was just busy day really uh every day of the week is really busy day um including weekends this semester and that which is gonna be tough to managing things and don't know that can manage everything i've decided that i'm probably gonna drop one of my courses which should make things tiny bit more manageable which is good just have to spend tomorrow writing about four pages and then have to uh have to go to meeting and write an article and do german homework and learn german and really should be reading from my government course so tomorrow gonna be hellish day i'm just gonna try to get up early and um power through and today also is very stressful had to uh worked and typed for while and i'm just stressed out about my writing course and about what wanna do for the summer and then what wanna do with my life so it just it tough but i'll figure it all out so today was just very hectic day for couple of reasons um had lot of writing to do and had very little amount of time to do it so that was stressful figuring out how to fit all that in um and then uh had to do something for an extracurricular i'm gonna be missing class tomorrow just so can get some extra sleep um and need it and i've earned it and uh uh it shouldn't be any major uh big deal so and um was just don't know today it was just completely academic day didn't think think about anything social had lot of homework to do and it was stressful but got through it kind of and um yeah dropped one of my courses just because realized it was gonna be too much work um so uh it was kind of big decision to make but feel like it was definitely the right decision and now i'll have little bit less on my plate and have lot to do tomorrow and just am gonna always have lot to do guess um so today just can just um slept in and missed my 900 am course because have was just up late last night so felt like it was best if went to bed mean if if slept in bit which was nice and then also missed one of my extracurriculars today just because had to study and so felt fine about that wasn't too worried about missing that and um and then just studied lot uh had few meals with my friends which were nice and uh i'm trying to think yeah not much happened today um starting to dropped on of my courses so my academics this semester should be bit more manageable and have to um go tomorrow and kind of organize my third extracurricular which hasn't yet begun um but just um i'm just focusing on kind of managing my academics at this point so today went to my german course and it went okay still have lot of studying to do um and uh and it just difficult to catch up um but that went well and then had uh my [inaudible] my uh writing course which was nice course and uh met someone who kind of had few things in common with which was cool and then um studied for bit and um met with uh co-teacher of mine for that i'll be teaching civics with next or like tomorrow we begin um so that was interesting and then um yeah and then had like study break tonight where we talked about blocking groups which was pretty straightforward not much to say about that um it was yeah it was nice nice day still just am very busy and have lot of stuff to do always which can be stressful so today was pretty busy day um had my german course in the morning as usual and that went well and was feeling confident but wasn't able to study as much as would have liked to today and just need to spend some time thinking about how important it is to study more and then had civ um uh had to started new semester of doing the teaching program do in new school with new person um so that was cool and it was tricky to figure out how to get there but it was he seems like nice guy and it was nice class and um that went well and it should be good semester um on that front and then um uh studied bit had dinner with some of my friends blocking drama is still present and um kind of stressful and i'm just really tired and um like said just need to focus on studying more and hopefully blocking stuff is figured out because it seems like it just stressful situation for for everyone so um today was pretty pretty good day wasn't able to study as much as had originally intended um but went to my german course and then went to my writing course and then went back to my room and studied for while and um eventually had another course uh film screening which was good and then went to dinner with some of my friends and then came back and studied some more um one thing that kind of irritated me was that don't know just feel like come off as bit dumb um kind of intentionally and don't mind that and feel like was just being kind of don't know don't like that but also um just feel like was being kind of judged by some people for some of my interests by like my friends tonight and just kinda pretentious and un and unnecessary feel like um but yeah don't know it was overall uh pretty good day um so today was pretty good day um had my german course in the morning and that went well and feel pretty good about about that course and then um studied for bit and um went to dinner with few of my friends and then my friend did like comedy show like 930 so that was good and then um don't know went back to my room it wasn't very eventful day and was kind of not very interested in um being around people yeah for good part of the day just like wanted to be alone which is good and that important to be that kind of way every every couple of days um so um was able to sleep in bit today which was good um and yeah so slept in studied for bit um had lunch it was pretty good day overall um was fairly proactive studying studied more today than was usually able to do and then don't know i'm still little bit stressed about blocking i'm worried that things are gonna fall apart 'cause that seems like something that might happen and i'm [gonna] you know knock on wood but um really hope that things just go well um and kind of had breakthrough moment today just few minutes ago when was thinking about my german course and how sometimes don't study as much as need to because know that can still get by on the course and do well on the exams without studying all that much um but just kind of at this moment [once] like i'm in the course to learn german um not not just to get good grade and so if commit to learning as much german as can that good grade will come and that kind of think the key so that was good moment so um have german test tomorrow uh uh and that something that i've been studying lot for today and i'm just still would like to study bit more for that so that something might stress me out bit but th think i've learned that you know i've just gotta try my best and then mo-move on with my life and i'm working towards trying my best um and had uh don't know there was not much of um was mostly studying had meeting for one of my extracurriculars that was like fine not much went on there then um yeah just studied and had dinner with my friends and um yeah it was fine day not much to to say really my sleep schedule feel like i'm not tired at all um already tried to go to sleep so that kind of weird but other than that things are good things are yeah going well so um today ended up being not super busy day but quite stressful day um had german class in the morning and took quiz in that class and uh it didn't go well so that was kind of frustrating but hopefully i'll do better in the future and just need to study more to ensure that do better and then had uh meeting with one of my teachers about one of my essays and she basically told me that like all of it was wrong so have to rewrite it which sucks um and i'm ve was just really frustrated with that for while and think it just gonna take bit of time for me to figure out where to go from there um and was just very frustrated with her and like the whole class um and was just irritable today and didn't really wanna be around uh mu many people and don't know not much to discuss today but i'm gonna try to go to sleep and hopefully tomorrow will be productive day so feel like was marginally more productive academically today than am most days i've just been very lazy lately and just kind of focusing on like instant gratification and entertainment as opposed to studying and that like just obviously huge problem that need to mediate and i'm gonna work on that um and so that just like my number one concern at the moment and then um uh kind of good thing about the day was that figured out my essay topic and that like worked good that worked well um and still have to write write it and figure some things out and then wasn't able to study as much german as wanted to because was just slacking off lot so it just huge huge problem procrastination that need to stop and it just sign of immense weakness yeah and need to stop it everything is gonna happen tomorrow in my head and like tomorrow never comes so i'm just gonna try my best tomorrow have to write bit for my paper write about 650 words which shouldn't be too bad um and then study bit and so should be good day so um today worked lot on my paper and was kind of stressed about having to write that but it seems to be coming together okay and so that good um and also was little bit stressed about blocking today and just but had some good conversations with my but with my hopefully my blocking group and so that seems to be hopefully panning out well um and that will open up um on monday the official blocking uh situation so looking forward to just kind of getting through that um have lot of work to do over the next two days lot of work but i've have had to do more in the past and it always turned out okay so know that i'm capable of doing this now it just matter of doing it and procrastination is still big issue that i'm i'm worrying lot about i'm stressed out lot about but hopefully i'll be able to manage everything and just keep things um under control so um uh spent the first two hours of my day in german course and that been going pretty rough lately and um i've just been having difficulty um staying up today in that course and my teacher kind of pointed it out so that was low point and then studied for bit worked on my paper for bit and then worked for th about three hours on my on-campus job with my friend and then had dinner with him afterwards so that was nice and then came back to my room and worked bit more it was good day was little bit irritated by and then like just disappointed from the from the german interaction that mentioned earlier um and so so i'm just very stressed this weekend as well because have lot of stuff to write and lot of studying to do on top of that so it been kind of difficult day and it gonna be an difficult next couple of days and i'm sort of just worried about [blocking] stuff as the date approaches but hopefully um hopefully everything gonna go [on] when work hard so um today was pretty busy day where had quite bit to do um started the day by going to my friend--my roommate and one of my friends uh were in comedy but not comedy but like dance show type of thing so went to that to support them which was cool um saw that and that went well um and then just have an enormous amount of homework to do and so i'm gonna end up having to write five pages tomorrow which is very stressful and tried to write lot today but wasn't able to get as much done as would have liked um and i'm just gonna probably not sleep for too long tonight so that can get get what need to get done done tomorrow and still know you know i'm gonna try to stay positive and just do everything um so yeah that that the plan i'm i'm stressed so um today was just very busy day from an academic perspective um just had lot of stuff due and so spent the entire day working on that and was pretty productive pretty efficient still wasn't able to study for my german course nearly as much as would want to which was upsetting um but just need to try to get some sleep and i'm gonna wake up bit early and try to study some german and then go to german course and hopefully not make fool of myself because don't know the content so um today was kind of rough day had really difficult time in my german course and realized that i'm falling behind in major way and have fallen behind and so now it just matter of kind of fighting to to get caught back up um and so that been very stressful um and then so just spent good part of my day working on that and then also kind of finalized my blocking plans and went through the process of formally inputting blocking stuff which is big relief to kind of be done with that and um and know that have blocking group to be part of and they're all people rea really like and it it all good it should be it should be good and um i'm sleeping less but like said i'm just uh very very worried about my german course and that kind of the main priority and the main concern at this point it lot of work and i'm just not as don't know i've just gotta tell myself that can do it uh so today good thing that happened was finally used my blocking plans and my german course went bit better than it did yesterday but still i'm just really struggling and i'm starting to panic about how difficult this course has become um and so don't know it just it very stressful and um yeah like said um i'm i'm just worried about being able to catch up and i've never taken course that been this hard for me i've always done well and so this sucks and then i'm also am have quiz tomorrow so just gonna try to get up early tomorrow and study for that um but yeah it should be hopefully i'm just gonna try my best and uh just have lot to do so today um had my german quiz which was just i'm not don't know how it went we'll have to see we'll have to see um and did my civics class which is like uh going to teach these people in [redacted] and these these kids in [redacted] and it went really well and so i'm excited for this semester um for that reason and also just lot of homework that is like impossible for me to keep up with and i'm just trying and kind of failing um but i'm just trying my best and uh so that bit stressful but like said i'm i'm trying my best and uh and hopefully it all will kind of come together and i'll be able to get done everything need to get done i'm just very stressed and i'm very tired and my sleep schedule has been very kind of out of whack lately um but i'm just gonna you know try to keep working and and pull everything together as as soon as possible and just maintain that so today was an interesting day had my german course in the morning and that went well and everything went well today but just had th weird interaction at dinner where guess friend of friend was sitting with us and guess she just like didn't was indicating uh via body language that she was like not fan of my personality and my other friend picked up on it and told me about it and that just kinda bothered me and made me think lot about the way behave um so that was not cool and i'm still like myself i'm still like my own i'm so yeah would rather wouldn't uh rather be anyone else um and uh so just have to work tomorrow i'm gonna sleep in i'm not going to my german course tomorrow just 'cause need to sleep and won't be able to sleep in my bed for the next couple of days because my roommate is having his girlfriend over so whatever i'm just gonna sleep tonight um so that should be good and things are good other than that just bit depressed guess but was bit of funk so today um don't know pretty low-key day uh slept in bit which was nice didn't go to my german course which uh don't feel fine about and then what did do cleaned with um worked with my friend for few hours out in my on-campus job and that was nice he cool kid and then uh what did do just it was nice to talk to him for while afterwards and then came back to my room and uh went to like dinner with my roommate and then like worked for while had some stuff to do like lot of stuff to do and so worked on that then finished that and um it was good day um still have lot to do tomorrow but yeah it was good day not too much to say so today was kind of rough day um just tried to get lot of studying done just don't wanna be here anymore i'm trying to go to sleep out on the couch in my common room because can't sleep in my bed tonight because my roommate has his girlfriend over and there are just mice in this room and just need to sleep but can't and i'm just bit irritated so that basically i'm just frustrated right now and that what i'm feeling i'm thinking that need to fall asleep that won't be able to because we saw mouse in here last yesterday yeah so i'm just debating what gonna happen i'm uh i've kind of been in heightened state emotionally i'm just very irritated so today was an extremely difficult day for me um had just rough experience early on and um it was it was tough and usually when would have difficult experience like that would just gonna hate myself after it and then have to do little bit but not as much and i'm proud of myself for that and i'm proud of my original aims throughout the situation it was just difficult day and i'm already at tomorrow and i'm already um i'm glad that tomorrow is new day i'm gonna wake up but i'm gonna try over these next five days i'm gonna commit to giving everything have to to my life to my academics finish strong and then go home for week and um just relax entertain myself constantly and just be relaxed and safe but until then just need to work on my academics and try my best in everything so that can tell myself tried my best and don't know that need to try my best in academics so i'll try just need to try my best in social things and [inaudible] like the issue that had today was kind of an interview-related thing and tried my best in that so i'll just try my best and leave the rest so that kinda the the thing i'm dealing with now so um today was definitely better day than yesterday but still i'm kind of haunted by the difficult situation had yesterday and think i'm uh you know maybe for while who knows um but don't know saw some of my friends today which was good i'm trying to just stay positive i'm trying to work really hard and ha-have been procrastinating lately so tried to stop that today and get some some work done and i'm just gonna try my best and you know continue um well not continue but start trying to like make make things better and like said just prepare for my midterms and and and hope that everything goes well and feel bit tired lately but i'm just trying to fix my sleep schedule so that that all works well as well and i'm just trying to like focus on loving myself and and things like that so today was another weird day spent lot of time thinking about that interview and just how horrible it went and ended up getting the position that wanted but still it just know that i've made horrible impression with all the people that i'll be working under and with and just made an absolute fool of myself and that fucking kills me like that so um ugh god it just kills me but have to get over it um it happened and need to work on moving on think every day i'm kind of getting little bit better at

from 1000 to 1100 and that went well and had meeting with one of my professors about something like had uh written for class and that went pretty well and i'm think might be on the right track with that essay and um still have bit of work to do um but we'll see what comes out of that and then uh had another class and then had dinner with two of my friends uh which was fine guess um just bit down think lately um but it was it was good day overall and um yeah so um uh today was um uh an okay day woke up um didn't sleep very well last night my roommate had lot of people over um until late in the or early in the morning and it was just keeping me up and it was bit obnoxious um or very obnoxious so slept poorly and then had two-hour german class um and it was really stressful because like the director of undergraduate studies was there like watching us and like evaluating our performance so think had like mini little panic attack while it was happening um but it was all it was all good and got through it um so just gotta remember like you know convince myself that it'll all go well and then it will um and um then like cleaned for like four and half hou or did my like on-campus stuff which is cleaning stuff for like four and half hours um with my friend [redacted] and uh oh shouldn't mention names but whatever uh so we'll say my friend uh and uh and uh yeah that it okay bye so um today was uh an interesting day uh slept pretty well last night um slept and just because it was really long week was gonna wake up early but decided just to sleep in instead so that was good um and then uh just worked bit on homework was gonna work bit um on my on-campus job but didn't really have time for it so just worked on some homework i'm just stressed out about all the work have to do stressed out that my grades aren't gonna come together stressed out that feel like behind socially and um just like deficient generally is how feel so that really stressing me out and i'm trying to work on that um and just have some issues that are um uh bit stressful and then also summer plans are stressful think have everything decided there but it just don't know thinking [about how] i'm gonna fund everything because i'm gonna be going abroad so uh just feel like i'm lot less uh lot more you know uh just def uh deficient relative to everyone else here so so um today was pretty productive day uh woke up pretty early to start studying had bit of quite bit of work to do um or fair amount at least and so studied bit and uh and i'm gonna wake up early tomorrow and study bit more and just hope hope that this german test goes well um have test tomorrow and um yeah and then just worked on uh had meeting for one of my extracurriculars and went to that it was pretty easy straightforward um and uh just hoping to get you know do well in my stuff tomorrow and i'm stressed about academics but am just working on improving my reactions and stuff like that don't know i've just never been this stressed about academics before so it um something i'm adjusting to and i'm hopefully doing good job of that um yeah and friend stuff has been weird lately as well but that all it all gonna be fine it'll be good so today was pretty interesting day felt bit under the weather uh but i'm you know mostly fine was really nervous to go to german class today for some reason i've just been um don't know it just stresses me out lot and get in my own head about it and was just really stressed about it but um that ended up going okay um so that was good in the end and then had another class and then something really exciting came in the mail for me so it was just exciting to to get that um and then had dinner at my house for next year with went to with my blocking gr with my uh blockmates which was nice um was like fine that was fun [i was struck] with that um then came back to my room and studied for bit and that about it it was good day overall um i'm just stressed about lot and things that need to do that i'm not doing but you know typical stuff so um i'd say today was semi-successful day got quite bit done and made commitment to stop procrastinating and was able to uh stick to it knock on wood um so i'll hopefully try to get uh continue working tomorrow have um big essay due thursday which is really stressing me out and just feel like quite bit is hinging on me doing well in it so i'm just trying to um basically just take what steps can to do well um so that the focus right now yeah just um don't know just uh guess you know my ultimate grade will be out of my control won't determine it but can just take as many steps as can now and put in as much work as can now with the time have left to um hope to you know use the advice i've been given and write as the best essay um possible mean that all can do so that what i'm focusing on now and i'm bit stressed uh but it should be good um so today was an okay day um uh just have big paper to do tomorrow so i've been focusing on writing that lot and was able to concentrate okay better than usually can um but um still just don't know i'm never gonna be able to get done as much done as want to get done so [inaudible] had an extracurricular today where go into [redacted] and teach 5th-graders some stuff so that was fun and it always good it kind of time commitment but it was uh you know always enjoy it enjoy it this semester so that was cool um and then just came back to my room and worked while i'm just focusing on on uh um the finishing my essay so it bit stressful um but by uh it due tomorrow night so it should all be done by then um and yeah that is about it i'm uh just trying to fi-finish this off as well as can and then move on uh so today was um like fine day just spent almost the entire day working on my um my essay for uh my writing class so today it was due at midnight and just spent the whole day working on that which was really stressed about and i'm not sure how feel about the ultimate quality of it but it done and i'm moving on with my life now and that been such priority lately have been kind of neglecting my other classes so i'm gonna get up early tomorrow and study bit before my german class and um then hopefully it'll work tomorrow and i'm just focusing on staying on top of things and uh making sure that do everything need to do um and uh you know it it stressful couple of you know weeks but we don't have that much more time left to this semester so i'm just trying to finis-finish strong and tired all the time but you know guess that just how it is so um had class this morning um which was [fine] and then spent few hours working which is always very tiring so the rest of the day was pretty tired and tried to study bit and um um came back to my room and studied bit then went to get dinner which was nice um but um [okay] [inaudible] to um study some more tomorrow and have some um meetings to go to but should be good and um yeah not much to talk about i'm gonna try to work bit more tomorrow as well um which should be good and um yeah so it was good day got lot done and um yeah that basically it so today was an okay day had lot of work to do for school but found that wasn't able to do much of it um and so just worked on my on-campus job for like an hour and then um worked bit on my german class um which was fine and then um uh yeah worked bit more and um yeah just had bit of hard time focusing um uh can and um figuring out what wanted to do um um what else oh had dinner with dinner and lunch with some friends which was nice um and tomorrow i'm just gonna try to be more productive um and uh start the week off on the right foot and um yeah so hopefully it all goes well so today just um have test tomorrow so was studying lot for that and um don't think it'll go very well but i'm just gonna try my best and hope for the best and uh yeah i'm bit nervous about that and um skipped class this morning like do um occasionally um just because don't know didn't really didn't wanna go and and well just ended up staying late and just didn't wanna go to the 900 am [inaudible] be fine um and um i'll be heading to bed now and hopefully just i'm focusing lot on that test and didn't really see any friends today or do too much socially um also had class today at at 100 pm which went to which was fine don't really enjoy that class but just matter of getting through it so yeah things are things are fine and i'll be cool so um today was pretty good day had my uh test early this morning that went really poorly um but what can you do hopefully uh you know don't know hopefully i'll be able to make up for it um later um yeah so that should be fine or that should be uh something focus on studied lot today and um worked bit on my on-campus job and then had meeting to go to for my summer job um which went fine don't really like the people that are there uh but it it just job you know that all it is really and so um i've just gotta get through that and it should be good then came back to my room and studied bit more uh it was good day overall and uh should be good rest of the week for sure that about it so today was an interesting day um studied or um slept like okay last night but was just super tired throughout the day so took like two naps and don't feel any shame about it was like really tired and still am um and then um like had lunch with friend had class early that was like not well and it never is but whatever don't care had an extracurricular where talked with uh where um like teach kids and that was really fun enjoy that but it takes like three hours to do um with transportation and everything so it took while um and studied bit and um uh went out to eat for dinner which was nice um and yeah i'm going to bed now i'm just worried bit about what wanna do for the summer i'm considering maybe should try to graduate early stuff like that um yeah so just lot of lot of stuff on my mind but um everything should come together i'm sure so today was quite busy day um uh um what did do went to my german class in the morning which went well and then um uh had another class which was fine and uh then um ah i'm trying to think of what did slept for while and then um no no didn't sleep for while don't know was in my room for while and then had another class and then got dinner with um what ended up being like quite few of my friends which was nice always like seeing um everyone in my blocking group plus few additional people that was really nice um yeah and then had to studied bit and then had to stay late like until 100 am at my at like 130 am on my on-on-campus like extracurricular activity to edit some stuff so that was stressful but it was good so got very little sleep um last night um which wasn't cool had to stay out late um and so didn't sleep much and so spent good part of today napping and just kind of laying around but also got some meals with my friends which was nice and studied bit and went to german class which went nice i'm lot less stressed about going to german now that the teacher that we have changed just have to focus on studying this weekend have some stuff to do tomorrow uh training have to attend which is gonna suck but don't have choice so yeah and um it should be hopefully good good day i'm bit stressed but and sh probably should be bit more stressed so just need to start working bit harder probably so um today was pretty busy day had the training thing for three hours for the summer activity that i'm doing um which was really nervous about because in the past i've like not done well around these people but it went fine and have more of that tomorrow so that'll hopefully go fine and whatever have lot of work to do tomorrow also like school stuff um which is don't know i'm just i'm i'm just behind academically and need to get caught up and every day it gets bit trickier to get caught up but just there not enough hours in the day so it just don't know trying to do it all and not really being able to which is stressful but that pretty normal and i'm just um interested to see how things are going to pan out ultimately and yeah that that about it i'm bit stressed but i'm trying to stay positive and just figure out what else can do to grow and things like that so today was once again pretty busy day had training for about three hours um for one of my extracurricular activities here on campus um and um so just did did quite bit of work for that and then um studied little bit [inaudible] something to write from uh my classes i'm just stressed lot but i'm i'm feeling bit more hopeful i've kind of given up on [inaudible] classes and it just about finding motivation to push through mean so yeah just need to realize that um um can't change with the grades i've already gotten in the class but can do my best to bring up the remaining um quizzes and things like that so it bit stressful but i'll figure it out as it comes so today was pretty good day had german class this morning and it went it went fine got through it um and then had lunch with friend and then um what else did do studied for while um don't know i've uh the test tomorrow that i'm bit nervous about but i've studied for it more than have for the previous tests i'm gonna get up early and study for it some more and hopefully i'll do well on it um it just lot of stuff and it kind of overwhelming academically and looking forward to the end of the semester and uh what else there lot of kind of social pressures at the moment uh so i'm not sure what gonna happen with those but um yeah it it was pretty good day hopefully tomorrow the test would go well i'm bit nervous about it and um had lot of caffeine today so hopefully i'll be able to sleep well i'm sure won't be and took some melatonin okay so that about it so today was pretty good day had test in my german class that was worried lot about and um hope it went well don't know if it did but tried my best on it and studied for it and think was more prepared going in or at least felt more prepared than was in the last one so who knows guess um what what get at this point is it doesn't really matter and um then slept [inaudible] and just extremely extremely tired lately and probably haven't been getting enough sleep uh but i've i've just been very tired and just probably not helped by the fact that i'm going to sleep at 200 am to wake up for 900 am class but yeah so that about that about it there i'm just stressed but and bit frustrated with life at the moment but got some good news back today so i'm happy about that for sure yeah i'm very happy somewhat so today was stressful day but um it was fine had my german class in the morning and that went fine that um going better lately knock on wood um but i'm hopefully gonna prepare bit more in the morning um and then had di uh lunch with friend then just studied for while um have uh an assignment an essay assignment to do in my writing class that i'm just having like very hard time coming up um uh topic and everyone else already has their topics and the teacher actually reached out to me to to give me specific help so that stressful but um yeah i'm just bit worried about some social things just have lot on my plate that i'm not really taking care of but um yeah and so that basically it it was fine day overall so today was an interesting day um classes went well and everything and um yeah th so that was all fine um actually uh there was one of my stress one of my classes that stressed me out because can't figure out what want to write about and think kind of figured out something today but still don't really know and i'm just it never good to feel behind um and like you're not on top of things just need to work on getting on top of things and starting to improve my life um have uh my grandpa is not doing well he in the hospital and he may not um uh be around for much longer hope that he is and it seems like he getting better so that good news um it um [inaudible] of course i'm very saddened by it and and well [inaudible] well it seems that it seems that he getting better so guess am optimistic and i'm i'm not thinking the worst right now i'm not expecting the worst um and don't don't know guess i'm not with him so don't know how bad it is but i'm not expecting the worst and i'm not thinking to myself that he going to die i'm not even considering it really but um i'm just hoping that my family keeps me updated so today was oops just dropped my phone um today was pretty good day um had class for two hours which went fine and then saw few friends for lunch which was nice and um spent the rest of the day studying and had few things to do but um yeah good day overall not much to talk about there was big party on campus that didn't end up going to i'm gonna just stay in and then study yeah really have to work on studying but um yeah things things were good today overall pretty good day hmm hopeful and went to the gym as well so um today was just stressful day in uh multiple ways because as the day went by realized that had more academic like assignments to complete that didn't realize so tomorrow should be very busy day and have i'm not don't know oh god yeah so i've kind of painted myself into corner and i'm bit fucked now but we'll just have to see what happens and um yeah so i'm stressed but i'm just gonna try to give it my best tomorrow and see where it gets me um yeah so it it should be you know should be able to get through it hopefully uh i'll just try my best you know am who am can't go back in time all can do is try my best from here so uh that what i'll do and uh yeah that about it quite bit of work to do lot on my plate for sure yeah so today had just lot of academic stuff to do lot of stuff i'm very very busy almost as busy as i've ever been academically um and tomorrow is going to need to be the most productive day i've had in my life because just realized have five-page paper due that haven't started yet um and it is 10 of my grade plus quiz that need to study for that uh this is on tuesday and don't know anything for it yet or yeah so very little for it yet so tomorrow needs to be the most productive day of my life and need to like get in the zone and and just be ready for it i'm gonna work very hard so that um you know ge so that don't know so the things this essay and the quiz contribute to grades so i'm gonna try to do well in them so that can boost my grades up um so i'm gonna yeah by working hard tomorrow i'll be able to kind of kick my grades in the upward direction which is very good in the long run um so yeah that about it and also had this weird thing up at friend today we went to like an escape room and uh [inaudible] wasn't very fun wasn't into it and it just kind of reveals the like because was with my blocking group and think it just kind of revealed the um don't know uh think lot of our personalities came up and revealed bit of think confli-conflict within the group and um don't know [inaudible] it don't know it important that we all have friends outside the blocking group which i've known before that but it just verified that they're all cool guys though that about it so today was um pretty busy day um am just very tired had lot of work to do lot of academic stuff to do um so worked on getting that all done and um yeah saw my friends we figured out our housing stuff um and so that was stressful what else is going on have quiz tomorrow that i'm not really prepared for but what can you do um yeah so it was just stressful day and things are getting things are gonna get tough especially as the year comes to close it just stressful i'm looking forward to 24 hours from now i'm just gonna push my problems onto tomorrow so go to sleep for little bit and then study some more and that is about it so today was um pretty busy day um uh just had lot to do had class in the morning and uh took test in it and it went poorly but don't really give shit and then napped for half of it and decided just to skip my writing class to nap and feel fine about that as well and then had lunch um with my friends out at our new house next year and dropped off some housing forms and then um worked uh couple hours got got bit done then had meeting oh then had dinner again with the same people and then had meeting with few other people that was really nervous about and do don't know struggle bit in those types of settings but did better this time than did last time so that good and then uh came back to my room worked bit more and uh it was good day overall um so today was um an okay day had german class in the morning and um and that uh went went fine guess and then um uh had lunch with friend and then um went back to my room and eventually went to the gym and exercised bit which was good step in the right direction and um yeah i'm just stressed lot about academic things stressed about some summer plans and uh just lot on lot on my plate lot wanna do and just don't have time for all of it or the the willpower i'm stressed about grades lot as well and typical things but um yeah i'm just gonna try my best something i'm rarely rarely able to do so today was fine day had my german class in the morning and that went fine and then had lunch and then worked for little bit with friend of mine on our on-campus job and that went fine um and don't know it was good day overall have lot of work to do for my german course and i'm just as usual struggling to find the the motivation to do it uh so that don't know it not great but um yeah i've don't know just have lot of work to do lot of work to do which sucks but um yeah we'll see what happens suppose lot of stuff going on this weekend so today was um pretty good day um had lot of stuff to do um uh hosting someone to visit us from my hometown so spent some time with him showed him around um that was fun and then saw some of my friends for meals it was little event at an upperclassman house that went to which was fun um well actually it wasn't fun like at all but it was like it happened and so it was fine guess and um yeah that about it came back to my apartment and straight to bed i've had issues um with motivation lately so that something i'm focusing on and i'm just kinda pushing forward and finishing up this semester um on as high note as possibly can so that about it yeah so today was another busy day um uh continued hosting this kid from my hometown for visit to us which was nice um and just had lot of work to do lot of studying um things like that and just um towards the end of the day got really stressed out that have so much to do for my midterm and don't even know where to start so i'm very stressed about that and finding finding the time to do everything that need to do and there not enough hours in the day honestly need to stop procrastinating and start getting on it um and thinking about motivation and why i'm doing what i'm doing i'm doing it so that get good grades and that have you know better future ultimately so that what on my mind so um i've just been little bit um think uh in kind of funk lately i've been really down on myself and i've just few minutes ago kind of contextualized put things into perspective and just thought to myself like don't know there like i'm doing very well overall uh and i'm just gonna need to take stock of my life and realize that i'm at really great school um i'm on the right track in life i'm way ahead of most of other 19-year-olds um and have more potential and just am more capable and things like that um but there are some kinks that need to work out some issues that need to be resolved and some are just like normal wear and tear but some are like don't know bigger personality issues that have so i'm thinking about that lot so today was pretty good day overall just um the next two weeks have lot of academic stuff going on and just need to make the commitment to dedicate the next 14 days of my life to improving the rest of my life and um realizing that i'm not gonna get in all my classes but if spend the next 14 days working as hard as possible can get higher grades than would if i'm continue in the same trajectory right now um and so that what need to think about and um had my german class today it went fine uh uh don't know had lot of questions today and for some reason can't think about what did don't know like studied little bit what did do oh god can't even remember what did today but few things yeah and it was productive day somewhat and um yeah it was good day but just need to find motivation you know within me without doubt so today was long day um had my german class in the morning which would you know don't know it just yeah so that happened and then had meeting with my um professor for one of my writing assignments and um just have lot of work to do um that assignment um is due may 6th so have think about 10 days to work on it um and actu-actually had lot of critique but lot of like really substantive stuff so i'll be able to like go from there and write good essay and and do know the work need to take need to do um so that that good and then um studied for little bit met with someone um and what else did do uh had big test kind of competency test i'm staying after school for few weeks to like work on cleaning team and be captain of team and um had big test for that and then like don't know was nervous beforehand but was able to like [hype] myself up and it was fine going in was really fine going in and then was fine you know throughout and fine leaving but don't know just had lot of critiques but think lot of like stuff need to learn yeah so i'm i'm really miffed about part of it but it was good day overall yeah don't know this [bitch] had kind of an attitude which irritated me but whatever ugh whatever okay that all yeah so today was long day hadn't sleep too well last night and uh got up early for my german class which meets at o'clock in the morning uh so don't know decided was planning on going to germany over the summer with the with the program here [inaudible] but decided that i'm not it not worth it to spend the money and really don't wanna go and am not at the level where could go so that was tough choice but i'm making it and um so i'm really home for the summer and uh hopefully spend lot of time alone hmm yeah just uh feel like so much of the choices make now the way that live my life is for other people and compare myself to others constantly so need to just try to get away from that and recharge my batteries and wanna do that over the summer so um today was not as productive of day as would have hoped originally um don't know did some work it was fine talked to my friends it was fine don't know it was fine day whatever not much to talk about i'm feeling fine worried about my finals but just need to think about my competition um and do as well as can yup so that is about it um yeah [inaudible] i'm just like really bad at making decisions like really bad oh my gosh don't know how could be so bad but am [aber ich bin] yeah so that cool dude don't know dude don't fricking know shit man don't know i'm just having hard time today and um yeah stressed out goddamn don't even know i'm just need oh god just need to like work hard at the and try to get as good i'm not gonna get an in german that not gonna happen but can get better grade if just commit myself to couple hours of studying jesus christ have no idea fuck man okay that about it bye so today was probably an uh yesterday was kind of rough day for me but today was calmer which was good um and uh yeah so that that that was go step in the right direction and um just did some work today didn't get as much done as like to get done big german test coming up on tuesday um uh that need to just study for tomorrow and study for few other things study for the the one day of tuesday and then i'll just do as best can spend some time getting confident i'm just scared lot of the the level of confidence that have in uh some situations is in social situations really is much weaker than those of my classmates i'm tr-trying to work that out um yeah so lot of stuff to deal with uh just one thing at time guess uh yeah so things'll be fine yeah it all pretty cool guess yeah today was an okay day whatever um so today was um an interesting day had my german class in the morning and went to an art museum and that was fine and then had lunch with friend and um then studied for bit and um just i'm still having issues [inaudible] but i'm feeling confident about my german speaking uh exam tomorrow uh just bit more work to do but i'll be able to fit that work in no problem just have to devote myself to it and have meeting tomorrow that have to prepare for as well but it really just kind of nuisance at this time but i'm like you

okay because it over um and just was getting like so emotional after it um um and it kind of don't know uh it was difficult course but i'm glad took it um yeah so yeah like my message to the german language is like will always love you but don't think can continue with the language um yeah so spent most of today um packing um have to be out of my dorm in couple of days um so yeah just focused on that and um yeah and so it was all did today but didn't do anything else um there still some work to do but did most of it today and um was just um um getting [i'm] ready to leave i'm ready for the year to be over um and to move on to my summer job um so yeah it am really not that upset that this year coming to an end it was an okay year but you know whatever that about it yeah don't know don't know how feel about [inaudible] so um today was an interesting day uh slept in again it one of my last days in my dorms and then um moved um or didn't move but um don't know what did do today had meeting for um thing and just got really overwhelmed and almost had kind of panic attack in the middle of the meeting which i'm embarrassed to say but just breathed and was fine and got through it so just need to kind of realize that don't know for whatever reason stuff like that scares me but can get through it if just breathe um yeah so i'm fine just need to realize i'm confident i'm fine can get through anything fake it till you make it yeah so that about it so today was really long day and tomorrow gonna be long day as well um just have lot of work to do and i'm just pretty exhausted um and think i'll be exhausted for while um yeah just need to drink some coffee in the morning had to um just worked all day long 'cause i'm doing staying on campus for most of the summer to clean and today was the first day of that and so i'm bit nervous about directing my creative but just have to like make sure take some time to get in the right mental state beforehand and breathe and i'll i'll be fine [inaudible] [ahead] it should be cool they seem to have [you know] some of them have an attitude so have to deal with that which is exciting um yeah so just gotta smile and breathe um yeah so have lot of work to do tomorrow did lot of work today very tired um should have tried to get to sleep earlier but can't was super busy and um yeah that about it uh so today was really long day um i'm working [inaudible] as captain so have to basically be on my feet all day training crew and then chucking on the crew and helping the crew so spent basically the entire day standing only got five hours sleep was just totally exhausted um but don't know did lot of work and made lot of money so yeah that good um and was little bit nervous about how was gonna do in previous days but this morning woke up and was just too tired to be nervous um so i'm just very exhausted have to go to bed um and then it will all start back up tomorrow have to get back up at about get up at about 655 so um 655 yeah so i'll have about seven hours to sleep about yeah so that should be good okay so today um was pretty good there were some hiccups but it was overall pretty good and also today was perfect day so um was working dorm crew uh getting that all set up or getting them all ready um was the captain so was just running around lot looking for my workers checking in with my workers inspect their progress um so that it was stressful was on my feet all day pretty exhausting but i'm making lot of money doing it so just do um not worried about making my deadline but worried that there little things that are gonna fall through the cracks um yeah so don't really stuck to the specifics of the plan that i've made like these like you know hour-to-hour plans but defin-definitely take the order that thought things are going and staggered things like planned on as like the the the big general aspects just didn't really find too much for me to rely on rely on anything more than uh kind of general stuff so today was really stressful day um i'm kind of trying um i'm basically i'm in charge of the evening crew that cleaning two whole buildings and tomorrow our last day of cleaning and i'm just trying to figure out how we're gonna get everything done on time um so that just been pretty stressful um but hopefully it'll all come together hopefully i'm managing um yeah so have some good workers and i'm just stressed about that but think it'll come together and it just about planning and making sure i've planned enough and yeah so just i'm thinking i'm lot about that and trying to make sure that i'm perfect there it nerve-racking and stressing stressful yeah so today was um pretty good day overall just um i'm working dorm crew as captain so have to clean finish cleaning one of my buildings today or get my crew to finish cleaning and make sure they're all on top of it and overall i'm pretty happy with the job that we did um yeah it not perfect but i'm i'm happy with the work that we did and we kind of hit all the bases that we needed to hit um yeah so think it was something to be proud of overall which am um yeah and and have few well i'll be here basically all summer um

today but feel fine just feel like behind everyone else but i'll be good just have these days sometimes you know and um yeah just you know get get some stuff done tomorrow and um yeah had an okay day overall just bit frustrating so today was another pretty mellow day didn't really do much today um just kind of shopped little bit for groceries that i'll need don't know how long i'm gonna end up staying on campus planned on staying throughout the summer but think i'm gonna try to take week off at some point but haven't got that approved yet so have to see if my bosses will allow that um yeah but hopefully it'll happen i'm just frustrated today just don't know not huge fan of myself lately which is frustrating um but it was fine day [inaudible] to start making some changes um yeah but there don't appear to have that much to talk about really yeah it was good day suppose so today was pretty good day overall just spent the day um uh working for dorm crew um so spent the day like outside setting out chairs and everything with lot of other people most of the other captains um yeah so it was it was good day overall um was like put in new situation um entirely and did um pretty well um so that was cool yeah it was good day overall so today was pretty good day um was just working all day got up at like o'clock to start working um and worked throughout the day so it was lot of

things up for commencement and things like that was fine was able to sleep lot when got home slept from like 600 to midnight and went to sleep until like 600 am so yeah it was good day overall um yeah not much to talk about was just super tired so it been good to be able to sleep for such long period of time yeah uh it just um looking forward to the end of the week last day of work is saturday uh but it was an okay day not much else to talk about that basically all did today so yeah so today was um an okay day worked again on my on-campus job for like 12 hours 11 and half actually so i'm making lot of money just i'm just worried lot about lot of things really really really really stressed um so i'll be able to sleep now that would be great then may have roommate joining me at some point which sucks thought would be in this room alone so that pretty awful um yeah so it um not great day think pretty uh not good day wasn't happy with the day but yeah and got some things done which was good and uh yeah just shitty day ugh hated it um but i'll be done soon and that what matters this week will be done soon mean tomorrow is my last day [of work] this week so today was the last day of work for this week um have st some stuff to do well the the week for me starts again monday and i'll be working for another two weeks and i'm done for today which is good um i've had nice room to myself for past two weeks but had mo roommate move in today that haven't met yet but it kinda frustrating to have roommate now um yeah but but okay over all yeah it was an okay day looking forward to the summer [silence] um so today was um pretty relaxed day just um was able to sleep in have been working lot over the last couple of weeks so it was hmm just nice to be able to sleep in um and so did that and then went out for bit walked around and um yeah and then went grocery shopping for some groceries that need um hmm and that was nice and uh yeah now i'm back in bed going to work tomorrow but um yeah so that should be fun and fine and that it bye-bye so today was pretty good day um was back at work spent almost the entire day on my feet was like ro running around walked like seven miles um just doing stuff so yeah it was really busy day um and then kind of stressful day because found out have an interview again on wednesday with the same people that interviewed really poorly with the last time um but think i'll be lot more comfortable around them this time know them lot more i'll know to kind of take minute to prepare to breathe before the interview just like go to the bathroom look in the mirror and just focus on confidence which is something wasn't able to do in the last time so this is chance to kind of indemnify myself um but i'm still worrying lot about it worrying that history will repeat itself but like said i'm lot more comfortable around these people um and yeah the stakes are higher this time or the stake well guess the stakes are about the same but um yeah well the stakes are maybe bit higher but i'm still um i'm worried but [inaudible] that i'll do good [inaudible] confident take the time to prepare and and beforehand just that that mental mental preparation and i'm hyping myself up it such an important thing and all these people are are friends they're all good people and um i'll just get through it and realize that um it just little tiny thing so today was really long day um i'm con still working dorm crew um so i'm doing that um so this is training i'm running around all day run around like 10 hours day um as captain um so that lot of work but i'm getting paid lot for it so that makes it all worth it um and then one of my friends came back to the campus and saw him for couple hours which was nice caught up with him um i'm just really stressed about what gonna happen tomorrow and whether or not i'm gonna be able to finish my assignment and was able to plan for couple hours tonight what wanted to do so um that should all go well i'm just you know worried about lot of things as usual but life will go on yeah so things are kind of winding down um 24 hours [inaudible] from today will be very good today was pretty good day um was able to sleep in and then was spent most of the day alone and then went and saw friend for dinner which was nice so today was pretty good day um i'm working dorm crew and this is my last week and think it gone good so far and i've gotten better as time has progressed as captain and this final week is um my last week here so it just kind of the time will show everything that i've learned and i'm stressed but i'm prepared for tomorrow and now the best thing could do is just get some sleep um i'm nervous because kind of my boss will be watching me tomorrow um but it just it is important to remember that all can do is my best and i've prepared and know have the skills to do it um i've done it the past two weeks so just need to rely on those qualifications and the confidence that the accomplishments of the past two weeks uh could give me and can do it and i'm going to do it 
6YG55,so today been pretty good day um definitely an improvement from last night with lots of friend drama and guy drama which i'm totally not used to because went to an all-girls school for so long but um mean things seem okay definitely resolidified my friend groups um practicing putting myself first which is definitely something new um trying to understand how college works 'cause kinda just live it out on limb um and you know you're gonna drown if you don't keep up and so need to look at courses because if don't get into with lottery course then i'm kind of screwed 'cause only have three classes so that kind of stressful but it know have faith but also feel like need to get on that um but did get lot of work done definitely didn't think could study with my friends but apparently can and felt really productive today studied for math and my econ homework just doing well and moving forward all this is very new to me so i'm just like getting used to it and stuff but it seems like pretty good day all right today was [desfrinitely] an interesting day it started out awesome and then didn't get into my class i'm super stressed now ate good food but don't know what to do with my life there no guidance kinda stuck on limb yeah there nothing else really going on i'm just super stressed super super stressed today got much better than yesterday ended up getting into my lottery class which was awesome made me feel like things worked out and the universe wasn't forgetting about me um sat in my econ classes didn't enjoy any of them um so that was unfortunate um and now i'm really nervous sort of about fail even like econ if i'm still thinking about money and not what gonna make me happy in life and that definitely drives me crazy um but you know did homework with my friends today i'm feeling like i'm with the same people all the time which love um but feel like it could be bad for me later on in life and that not gonna be good but i'm hoping to make more connections have so much to do in so little time and i'm just wondering if this is actually doable and if these teachers are expecting me to do everything or if it supposed to just be like we give you all of this you know do what you want to do from it don't know and this is really frustrating and stressful and guess college is the beginning of being an adult but there just no guidance there it like huge gap between high school and college and don't know how to handle it so that is really really positive just kidding it not um but yeah witness one of my friends having breakdown today i'm surprised didn't have one as well 'cause just really didn't enjoy my classes and that was what was looking forward to but i'm hoping things get better it just the beginning saw my dad today that was good um yeah also had this thing where don't feel homesick at all um and some people do definitely come across that but just don't feel it um feel like there nothing to miss and like where am like the people that i'm with and i'm wondering if that also bad thing and if i'm pushing my feelings away because i'm so busy or don't know but yeah today was definitely an interesting day spent more time by myself than think have my whole time here um it definitely got lonely it was definitely little bit scary um made me feel pretty isolated didn't love that um but think it something that definitely need to get comfortable with but mean got lot of work done today which is good um took test today was studying for it all day but think uh it paid off which is good i'd been studying yesterday too so it wasn't all cramming but definitely did get nervous last minute and decide to really just do that but got all my homework done for today which is good um let see yeah had really good interaction with my friend today you know told her how lonely got and stuff um and how was nervous that would be that person in the group that we had just sort of left because they put us through lot of emotional stress and didn't wanna be burden on anybody um but yeah she was really supportive really helpful you know reminding me that that not who am i'm very different person um i'm also nervous about classes don't love everything that i'm doing but it is the first week so it could just be don't know just not great but i'm hoping things get better um and i'm still grappling with this idea of do wanna be happy or do wanna secure job or can do both or you know but um yeah that definitely something that been hanging over my head um and is really scary actually um and it not something that can ask anybody for help for which is also nerve-wracking because i'm so indecisive and don't do anything by myself but here to adulting pretty good day today got lot of work done i've been to [redacted] initiation which was cool um yeah had some time by myself had some time with friends today felt kinda weird it was like lot of stuff to do in little time but got lot of work done and was able to work ahead of time which is important but [inaudible] practicing that is really hard but yeah not bad not bad today had pretty okay day today um didn't get as much work done as i'd wanted to still trying to figure out how to do what work when um but yeah had an interview today also don't know how that went for consulting but we'll see i'm just coming back from the library now it 145 and was 10 o'clock girl three weeks ago here am coming home at o'clock in the morning from the library but oh well i'm liking the readings i'm learning [inaudible] yeah interesting day today it was nice doing homework today because was productive yesterday and today so things feel little bit better um got most of one application done still have another one to do it kind of like i'm drowning but like my face is like right at the surface so had air but like you know um you know one wind could really just kill me and i'm kinda nervous and feel like i'm like uh floating but i'm really nervous about econ i'm nervous about you know being on top of things and doing things right and like applying to too much yet not enough and i'm really just trying to figure out this whole experience also coming from an all-girl school social stuff is kind of nuts like guys are thing apparently and like don't know just don't know how to take social cues and that very damaging so that something that stresses me out but yeah it happening today was pretty good day um don't know you could say like worked with different people definitely worked by myself today and was productive finished applications am super worried about extracurriculars there just so much to do but the comping process makes it like once you get denied there nothing left and that really scary um but yeah i'm hoping everything goes well just have to sort of have faith guess 'cause at this point have no idea what to do um homework is going okay not amazingly um this is never-ending cycle but it okay um yeah i'd give today like not great but not terrible today was an awful day um [and ain't] the first day that have come in um don't know just come to terms with my actuals emotions how i'm feeling how i'm not doing well feel like don't belong here like i'm not good enough getting rejected from everything and find myself being jealous that my friends got into programs that didn't and i'm so proud of them but at the same time i'm wondering what wrong with me what am missing you know why don't have drive why why am always left out and it super super frustrating because don't know what wrong with me and if did know would change it and just like want to know but feel like things happen for reason and i've always believed that but at this point feel like can't anymore because there no way that i'm supposed to go through this much turmoil this much stress this mus much like self-degradation every single day it just hard to come to terms with my reality when it sucks so much um and did that today and it hurt me lot didn't even trust myself to go to the bridge and just relax because didn't know what would do that really stressful to think about um and don't know if i've been low like that before 'cause block things out in order to forget them but i'm just like super stressed and feel like i'm not supposed to be here and that this place wasn't meant for me which it wasn't but don't know what to do with myself think really might go into really deep depression here and it gonna be an awful experience today was pretty great day got initiated for the [redacted] that was awesome um yeah hadn't felt like young again you know was dancing with friends went to party um danced guessed whatever they call it here um but also like went to class and got some work done and had an okay meal um but uh guess something that stands out to me today was my connections with people not only did get to meet great people in the [redacted] initiation and like having found my big siblings and things like that but also got to connect with friends um that like met outside of abhwa that were guys actually and guess they're pretty normal which is interesting um it just like i'm able to open up to them where opened up to one person today and just saying that like you know don't mean to come across as like trying to avoid people or or upset or or just like distant it just don't want to do the wrong thing because of where i've come from but which is going to an all-girls school for eight years like just wanna make sure that i'm doing you know th-the right things and not overstepping anything or making people feel uncomfortable because i'd never wanna do that especially because know what it feels like um so that was actually really nice really really grateful and like i'm sort of excited about these relationships to see where they go and stuff um but yeah also feeling like definitely not good enough still um my friends are all better than me and i'm so proud of them but at the same time i'm wondering what did wrong and if belong here but you know things are happening but yeah had pretty great day today had lunch with my dad hung out with some friends made some new friends and really meaningful connections which i'm really happy about am feeling okay with my extracurricular commitments and i'm just gonna be happy with who am and gonna do this homework one step at time it is not gonna be easy and that okay but i'm i'm gonna do what can as can and as much as can yeah i'm i'm actually really happy with today today was was pretty awesome so i'm very very happy made better friends with the guys and basically they have my back and they're not like intimate or anything but just wanna be my friend which is great and it just like don't know maybe have different outlook had some really good discussions with people and it just felt normal like almost forgot that they weren't girls which was cool but yeah i'm i'm happy i'm pretty happy today pretty okay day today um had lot of work to do got some of it done um starting to [inaudible] in the morning had new experiences um let me think yeah got to see [redacted] today which was awesome she been gone for two days which was really long time feel like we've gotten so close like just like my friend [inaudible] this past couple of weeks that um small amount of time feels like lot and that definitely really interesting how it like this is the new world this is like my group of people now that i'm with basically 247 and actually like like it and feel excited about it and feel like i'm actually have [inaudible] [constant] which is different from home um but it really noticeable and things are different which is little bit scary but yeah interesting day today um lot of things went wrong um basically feeling super incompetent about everything that do i'm not really happy with myself or proud of myself or the programs that i've gotten into uh just one which is really exciting um just kidding it not um yeah my friends were definitely there to support me though and they're definitely having well one of them at least is having similar issues with just feeling like they're not their best self not really good enough for this place and things like that um definitely cried today just couldn't keep it in just feel like i'm not enough not good enough will never be and it hard to be to suck really um and so my mom is giving my cat away which is great you know just icing on the cake um yeah to cope with my emotions ordered some insomnia cookies my friend got me ice cream 'cause was crying outside over like everything yeah basically it just really sucks to suck and when people say it it just seems like joke but it very painful process and almost feel depressed like am very unhappy with myself and don't like myself right now so yeah thought things are getting better um that was like getting my homework done started to get back on top of things then got my [ec grade] back today for my first [inaudible] and got 792 and feel like crap um and think everybody else is doing really really well and and getting these great grades and here am can't even get anything good on my [ec] thing and it like don't understand what i'm doing wrong still like i'm trying so hard i'm putting in effort and it like it not enough and don't understand why i'm here if can't succeed um it just really bothers me and today like had moment where couldn't even take it like went to the river and sat and stared at the water because i'm so disappointed in myself all the time um yeah basically hate myself and academically think i'm trash socially i'm trash uh and want to stay positive when think of been known as like bubbly person um in my friend group but like lately don't know can't even like stay positive about these things because every day it like something new that just tearing me down and like don't wanna talk to my parents about it because don't want them to worry think i'm not doing well and then think i'm gonna fail like they always do but like don't know where to go and like can't do it anymore and feel like i've been able to deal with stress and like not doing well but this is another level where can't even look at myself right now and like like really hate myself and i'm so disappointed in everything that do my peers are doing so great and wonder what i'm missing um so i'm just trying to get around that today i'm doing really bad don't wanna kill myself but like there nothing that makes me wanna stay anymore so i'm just like really tired and now just go to sleep so don't have to feel any emotions it just everything is going wrong my mom wants to give my cat away can't get good grades can't make the right decisions socially academically i'm not doing well can't stand out and when do i'm wrong and it like why is econ so like not even hard just like not made for me and don't know i'm i'm really really really really stressed pretty interesting day today um didn't really have too much stress from my friend group barely saw them um but definitely had some stresses with my parents and them dealing with me not being there and my cat et cetera um but yeah today was kind of weird day didn't love the day actually really like um like being with my friends so that was unfortunate but got like some work done and did okay i'm going to bed at an almost reasonable time so that good but i'm just really really tired haven't been getting enough sleep i'm like not aggravated with my parents but just um coming to terms with the fact that now they need to know that didn't have happy childhood but don't wanna break their hearts um 'cause know they worked hard but yeah just those types of stresses pretty good day today um got some great work done met with the study group went to some great office hours and actually understood stuff which is really exciting so i'm definitely gonna try to switch groups um just kinda felt accomplished today like did something and got it done and feel confident about what it like um didn't see my friends as much today but when did see them at the end it was really great it was like reward which is awesome um yeah mean it was definitely different type of day like was definitely alone lot like just doing homework and stuff but got all the work done that needed to get done which was huge have nothing to do tomorrow that due tomorrow so i'm happy with that i'm very very happy pretty good day today [coming] [inaudible] my phones didn't do as much work as wanted to um but was able to be there socially for somebody else for multiple people and think that really important so i'm kind of okay with that um yeah mean it was pretty casual day was definitely more relaxed than usual and didn't have lot of social interactions until after my classes i'm feeling in pain like i'm literary sick um and like my intestines hurt but don't have time to go to health services so that won't be happening soon um yeah yeah i'm just trying to balance school work with social life 'cause do need to [inaudible] my time pretty good day um until the football game which was awesome got to see my friends from home which was great um definitely had new social experience today where don't know if i'm attracted to people or like if i'm attracted to specific person but like the fact that my roommate kind of like came in and kind of meddled with something that had or was working towards maybe unintentionally did not appreciate that whatsoever um this one was getting around that you know didn't really feel protective of that person until this happened um so yeah don't know how to quantify this experience or feeling or like anything um but yeah that definitely stressed me out bit um discovered new friends through that or like better friends should say um so out of the social tension or like academic stress like think can deal with but the social stress is something very new um definitely dealing with body image issues right now just staring into the mirror um feel [inaudible] which is exciting just kidding it not um but yeah really love my friends hoping we stay great friends 'cause really trust them yeah pretty good day today um relieved some stresses that was feeling before did little bit of self-care today and got things that needed or just wanted like my phone and um some makeup that i'm going to learn how to use uh also um good connections with my friends um both guys and girls um yeah definitely making progress again and building confidence think and and being okay with you know things that are supposed to be the way they are um when it comes to like getting into things and programs and stuff so i'm gonna do the one program that got into and i'm gonna do my best at it i'm gonna do my very best and i'm gonna be great in it um and that how i'm gonna improve myself um so i've been like thinking about it lot and you know just telling myself to apply for everything now because nothing really given so it something have to deal with but definitely working on it and making steps to get better improve myself and just not put too much emphasis on like social stresses and just really get my schoolwork done um yeah um today was pretty interesting day went to reading class by myself instead of with my two friends um they didn't end up going this morning but felt fine actually sometimes feel freer to express myself academically when i'm not around friends um so which is kind of weird um other than that definitely did get to see them did program at the iop today where basically sat and listened to lady talk and people asked questions um something else uh socially um guess just this guy like don't know what he wants because don't know anything um but nah he wants to like hang out um and don't know what that means and i've been supported really well by my friends um and they've just been sort of helping me understand how feel trying to figure out how he feels and just get around that so that definitely been something that been sitting on the back of my mind other things that have been sitting on the back of my mind are exams and midterms that are coming up um but it all just feels like blur in the near future which is also not good um and need to plan that out and that like stressing me just little bit um but yeah those are most of my social stressful interactions pretty interesting day um had lot of work to do still have work to do not done super super unfortunate feeling um struggling with the econ still but things are getting better just have like so much work to do and so little time and it not even like wasn't productive today like was and i'm not getting enough sleep and i'm getting sick so it like there nobody you can go to because everybody says college is so hard and stuff and like they think we know what we're walking into and we don't and just like feel like super unprepared but also like it not doable can't do everything and it kind of sad and little scary um didn't really see lot of my friends day was doing lot of my homework and would've hoped that if had spent day like that it would've at least paid off and it didn't so that was unfortunate um yeah tough day today had super super super heavy load of homework still needed to do things today that didn't get to um i'm really really struggling with econ feel completely unprepared um think this may be one of the worst decisions i've ever made and even with tutor now i'm going in on my second meeting tomorrow can't do the set by myself failed the actual unit review thing today and the lady let me pass 'cause could talk through it guess but like i'm just so unprepared and then there like no help and i'm drowning and that really stressing me out the fact that i'm walking home at 230 and i'm not even home yet just like this is really awful um but yeah that really where all my stress is lying right now can't really think about anything else some like guy problems are like they're miniscule really compared to my academics at this point um but yeah am so stressed so stressed rocky day today lots of emotions felt like couldn't do econ but got it done best work maybe not got math done um let me see just had some interesting interactions with friends um guys new but feel like i'm making really good connection that i'm really proud of and happy with yeah and i'm really tired and need to go to bed and should've gone to bed but didn't so here am all right yeah pretty okay day today feeling really sick um socialized with different group of people today that found stimulated me bit more um which really appreciate and it makes me kind of rethink what i'm doing who i'm being friends with and how i'm allocating my time among those groups um i'm also stressed about mid-terms didn't study as much as i'd hoped to today but yeah need to get cracking so i'm organizing everything in the process but yeah i'm just really asking god for help right now 'cause i'm so so so nervous but yeah another interesting day um spent time with my mom um which was good she has been expressing lot of feelings about me not spending enough time with her pushing her away or whatever so worked on that today and and some parts of my mind were like you really need to study you really need to do work but other parts of me were like this is really important and you really need to work on this relationship as well and i'm really struggling with balancing school work and and social life and social life is lot but i'm i'm trying and i'm really nervous for these midterms and keep thinking about the studying that have to do and don't quite know how to do it but i'm asking god for help because at this point really don't even know what to do and feel like after these first ones i'll be prepared and like i'll know and went to the bureau of study counsel so i'm ahead of the game for the next time 'cause don't like feeling this way um yeah went to party tonight and came back at reasonable time but was talking with the same guy again till late at night don't know what that means feel like don't even want to admit it to myself so yeah but mean pretty positive day socially would say pretty chill day just did lot of homework saw my parents for quick second and they dropped off some things but wanna get to bed early i'm so tired and i'm sick and need to care for myself also need to study even i'm putting my homework first today because it important um upcoming events that are on my mind are my math midterm which is tuesday my ec midterm which is wednesday um avoided some people today 'cause just wanted to focus um so like stayed with my usual comfort group but didn't branch out bit like usually do to my other phone group um and yeah i'm definitely struggling with things people wanting to be with me hanging out with me and don't wanna be there 'cause feel like have important things to do but then i'll turn around and go with different friend group so don't really know but yeah pretty i'd say it was pretty laid-back day actually um pretty big day today or or tomorrow guess have my math exam tomorrow i'm studying for feeling okay about um lot of new social things arising person i've been hanging out with expressed that he like me today it wasn't really in the way that had expected it was more of surprise so something that i've heard from everybody else except him um so yeah while was doing my work it just sort of like came up again and then he like took me outside and then spoke for little bit and i'm little disappointed um and don't even know why don't know how to read these situations but like guess wanted there to be something and and wanted to move forward but the fact that i'm not the reason why it wasn't happening um is unfortunate think for me in my opinion and so little bit sad about that and don't know why i'm sad like basically it just like he very interested in me or whatever but like he he wants to make sure of what back at home and just like if he gonna have relationship or not um yeah and and and don't feel like like i'm not enough or anything but guess it was just disappointing really don't know how to feel so here am struggling as usual as usual pretty uh lonely day today didn't feel lonely but realized later that was alone for lot of the day um just di-did lot of studying uh got lo lot of work done um but yeah tried to focus on my work today was getting distracted lot about the situation with this guy but it don't know what gonna happen and have faith that things will work out the way god wants them to but right now just really wanna do well in my mid-terms and don't know how feel about the math and don't feel amazing um but did definitely know things which was great um but yeah it just makes me more excited for the next ones in terms of like actually being prepared and like getting my life together and planning ahead or whatever 'cause definitely didn't do that and it backfiring just bit so yeah and i'm just ready to restart and it hasn't even ended yet so it little bit nerve-racking but hopeful pretty okay day today um spent most of my time by myself um did really well in my classes today think which was awesome only had one class today but we had section as well as lecture and think did pretty well um yeah felt productive by myself but was happy no but then got around my one of my friends' and my dorm whatever you wanna call it house and started to feel like disappointed in myself like i'm not doing enough still which is really unfortunate um but yeah so thought hanging around my friend would make me happier but it made me feel little bit less efficient which was surprising because i'm always happy for people when they do great things and stuff so it was streak of jealousy that didn't like yet here it was um but yeah did some homework by myself today and with friend i'm gonna start doing homework by myself little bit more just 'cause think need to get comfortable with being with myself 'cause haven't been by myself in while so yeah just very [inaudible] day for where i'm comfortable pretty interesting day today worked lot on my essay that wished started earlier when finally felt was making progress went to office hours and basically had to restart so started worrying on have to go to bed 'cause i'm going home tomorrow and making an early trip and really need to get some sleep um but i'm nervous about this paper i'm super nervous about it and worked on it basically all day but yeah i'm just really stressed about that sometimes kind of the only thing could think about unfortunately uh are there social interactions was pretty much alone today um some of my guy friends came over by surprise tonight felt it was interesting um interesting occurrences with those people but really do like them and enjoy their presence so it was fine um and saw my girlfriends today my normal group my home basically um yeah so saw like most people today just not as much as usually do and did like all my homework by myself so that was new was it as productive mean occasionally i'm really focusing on the paper guess but yeah it was difficult to grasp well was really just struggling with that work crying and felt the usual but yeah really wild day still working on this paper that is due at 10 o'clock tomorrow thinking i'm just gonna wake up in the morning not allow myself to do anything no fun no friends no food till finish this essay 'cause i'm really over it don't wanna do it anymore it all i've been thinking about haven't done any other homework should've been getting ahead this weekend but i'm not really frustrated with myself 'cause feel like can't limit myself when it comes to certain people and that really really hard but yeah basically my life sucks and i'm terrible at self-control in social situations um today spent most of my time by myself um finishing an essay that was due at 10 o'clock tonight finished it at like 300 um but then had to like cut out words and like put in the the formatting and citations in um but yeah so like it was kind of productive but at the same time wish had done it and started it earlier really don't like finishing things on the day it due um so today is gonna be well today was lesson guess tomorrow is gonna be productive don't um like having to cram work um so tomorrow i'm gonna do just lot so don't have to do that um other things didn't get to see all of my friends today so ended up [inaudible] didn't get to see him today but um yeah also i've noticed um my friend uh she told us that she was depressed little while ago um and feel like know little bit about that just because of where i've come from um and that like you have good days and you have bad days and and things like that and think i've dabbled in depression actually quite bit but don't really know how to help her and like she doesn't want help but want her to be happy you know um and know what bothering her and it her boyfriend who just like is not being great person um but guess it like not in my range of authority and can't really tell her how to do these things because i've never done it but just like feel terrible and wanna you know she really close friend and care about her so that been something that i've been thinking about but yeah that just been in the back of my mind sitting um today spent most of my time by myself doing my homework went to bed pretty early last night so woke up little bit early but got 11 hours or almost 11 hours of sleep which is great um so felt really good really needed that worked on homework for one class all day today it was that much um it was over 70 pages of reading and other articles and had to write stuff about it um which is atypical but i'm sure why it quite took me so long um today but um now that i'm done with my midterms am try well not really have more coming up um but really wanna get ahead so i'm going to try to get ahead within these two days um and just get ahead in econ and math wanna study wanna do really really well on this next test because didn't do on the last one um and i'm just really determined i'm trying to remember who am so um just read card birthday card from my friend from home and it says something along the lines of can't way to see the things you do you're incredible um i'm just trying to remember who that is and find my drive um and think with some of my friends do find that and with others don't um but yeah upcoming events that have been on my mind are really just future exams now i'm just really trying to get ahead of schedule that my goal um 'cause don't like doing things last minute or the day before they're due um yeah today was also with my friend while she was talking to her boyfriend things aren't going well and that was really interesting to see because don't really know how normal relationships work um thanks to what my parents had so yeah that was pretty much my day mostly by myself felt productive but just as productive when was with my friends so we'll see um pretty interesting day spent lot of my time by myself again um just doing homework reading studying trying to get ahead did little bit um not as much as i'd like to but definitely made progress um yeah just trying to prepare for my next mid-term which is on 19th um so have some time but really really wanna get cracking on it 'cause need to do all that wanna do uh um so i'm just really trying to focus on school now and and get ahead um that basically my biggest priority let me see what else yeah saw lot of my friends today had one-on-one with the ones that usually don't um but it was fun and you know just seeing my friends do well in school get good things i'm like obviously good grades do come to me but guess don't like broadcast them but it feels like they just come to other students at much higher rate than they do for me so that been something that been kind of knocking at my academic confident but um i'm trying to get around that i'm really trying to work on that but yeah another interesting day today um had definitely had some time to do some homework right by myself which did also ended up doing little bit of homework with my friends um let see um other than that mostly heavy with classes today today had the most classes um that felt really good that did some work on my um tea set and things started to come together which has never happened before in econ so that really positive um let see some things that are on my mind are my ma my math exam which is thursday that i'm trying to study for earlier but every time tell myself i'm gonna study for it have like no time so it really unfortunate um yeah just seeing how my friends react differently to stress one friend barely reacts at all she has midterm tomorrow didn't really know and my other friend had midterm today and you could definitely see how stressed she was about it for while um yeah i'm just trying to really get ahead of the game and do really well other things um went to my guy friend house tonight or like dorm whatever you wanna call it um and basically just had like normal conversation at first but then bit more conversation about like what going on with us guess and like how he not really ready for relationship which was interesting don't feel mad or sad or happy about it i'm just sort of there seems like it would be my reality as soon as feel like i'd be willing to possibly you know if somebody else is not so yeah just really interesting me trying to grapple with that and understand if even want relationship if i'm ready for it don't know how that gonna go with school so yeah pretty interesting day today um had type of social interaction that was more academic-based than like what it usually is where it just like me struggling with my friends or having really good time with my friends um instead we had some really interesting discussions about race and identity within uh education in my class and spoke up about that and there were like couple of problematic things so spoke to lot of students about it especially the tf spoke up in lecture um so that was huge um other things sat with different group of people today um at lunch and definitely don't fit into that group but think it really interesting and really enjoyed being there because they're so comfortable with theirselves and they're so free-going and confident and wanna encapsulate that and find that confidence within myself um yeah did lot of work today catching up or really staying little bit behind but yeah it getting better today was really good interesting day um interesting day today failed my econ midterm um so that was interesting um had really good heart to heart with group of my friends today all of us really just talked about how we were struggling with what and learned more about my friends um but also like got deeper understanding of my own emotions and figured out how lost was and and these tears were falling from my eyes but didn't know what they were coming from um so then had another heart to heart with my friend um and he gave me some really good insights as well and i've just lost hope um and i've lost myself here so i've been trying to find that um upcoming things on my mind are my next midterms homework getting on top of my game just doing really well and also just keeping faith and understanding this process and taking things for what they are but also not just being complacent and failure um yeah this is sort of new day for me and and new lifestyle this is gonna be the beginning yeah pretty low-key day today got little bit of work done went shopping um went to party tonight got somewhat closer to male friend but think like kinda destroyed it unintentionally of course um as usual so don't know what i'm doing um but yeah was having good day now i'm pretty um know i'm gonna be distraught for like the next uh at least day and half so just gonna get over that um let see social interactions events that are upcoming events and studying need to study for my math midterm keep saying i'm gonna do the practice exam and don't um so that really annoying um yeah the party today was really interesting and i'm still out with this guy loved it it felt great it felt right but of course had screwed it up and was screwing up school so really really really really really need to do well so i'm gonna focus on that and just let things happen because cannot live with this recurring sadness of failure just washing over me all day every day just need to do something right and at this point the only thing that feel like could potentially do right is something academically so that what i'm gonna work towards but um yeah definitely pretty emotional right now um pretty interesting day today uh got like good amount of work done even though thought wasn't being very productive ended up really turning that around um caught up with econ did my [math] piece at friday night so yeah mean maybe it wasn't very productive today because only did econ but did read multiple chapters and take notes so yeah uh uh um definitely looking over social struggles that i'm having with specific people and like relationships and relationship building and and feel like at this point am just going to take the relationships that have now that know are great and then valuing lot um i'm gonna keep those ones as they are and then for other ones i'm just gonna put my schoolwork first know they happen if they happen if they don't they don't um yeah i'm definitely struggling socially but i'm really pushing it to the side because don't care and don't want to care um but yeah so that definitely happening but other than that went to brunch today and that was really when saw my friends and then at dinner saw them again but most of my time it was by myself yeah not bad had an okay day today did most of my work by myself it was pretty productive learning that don't know how to study so that was exciting um had breakfast with my friends today had dinner with my friends lunch with different group of people um definitely feeling some type of way about certain individuals now really just don't want to hang out with them don't want to be around them um and that definitely new because i've been trying to be very positive about everything but i'm really over it um let see no really spent most of my time by myself today it was super busy kind of really structured day with just like one thing to go to after the other but really liked it and it made me feel um kind of like how it used to be where had structure so had to do my work and it made me be lot more productive and really appreciated that so yeah pretty okay day today um pretty busy going back to this thing with heavy schedule lots of things to do um it was pretty productive at night it bit of later night than i'd hoped um but i'm still getting to bed didn't spend lot of time with friends today until later tonight and it was only one person so definitely saw less people but just coping with stress and putting structure back into my life um with like making sure go to things while at the same time you know trying to fit in social things and then studying and not pushing people away or cutting ties um other than that yeah just really focused on lot of my academic things today and left it at that and it didn't feel bad wasn't super super happy but did like the structure so yeah um what else no literally just did school today and that was it but didn't have to do any homework last minute today and that felt really really good um had an okay day today it wasn't very productive on top of that lost elections for [redacted] um took math practice the exam today did pretty well told myself that that wouldn't be the last thing do and nor would take it as reflection of why i'm studying even though it went well because should review still and it was different material 'cause it was different test um and yet didn't went to bed quite later than hoped um and don't feel stressed like feel like emotionally hurt like inside but don't really know how to like don't know release it spoke to my friend today over facetime and cried to her because i'm not good enough for this place um and that i'm inadequate for everything that do and everything thought knew about myself i've failed that here so um that definitely struggle um yeah today like it was just busy day academically and at the same time still feel like i'm stagnant in my work but yeah also my friend was talking to her boyfriend over facetime and he seemed really great and amazing and was like wow wish had that you know um then realized that well after she hung up she was like think he gonna cheat on me or like whatever and it was so different from how the phone call seemed and that was fear that remember from my childhood and it made me nervous guess but like also while they're on facetime like was talking to her boyfriend friend and like we're really hitting it off or whatever and it just like they're so much around me lot of it that can't take advantage of simply because i'm not good enough but um there are so many risks as well though and that little bit scary to me but essentially today was another bad day where all of my thoughts are justified and that i'm not good enough for anything here and am not who thought was um pretty okay day today did some cram reading uh this morning unfortunately and but i'm glad did it it was really helpful for the class um then studied for my or uh like reviewed for my midterm little bit and took it and feel really good and loved that feeling of doing it and after doing it where it like okay i've seen this before can do this i'm confident and it and i've been progressing like for more than one day before so that was something that really gave me uh um peace of mind and so that something that i'm gonna try to practice now um also um let see um was let in on some struggles that my friends are having some my guy friends are having with girls guess that was eye-opening in that like there are lot of people with different plans for life and lifestyles here and like abstinence and things like that and think lot of people are breaking under this pressure and that they're not sure who they are or that they can even stay [through] the morals that they've created here because there so much going on and sometimes you're so deep in things that you can't really see where you're going and um that effect think has tremendous um amount of weight on your shoulders um especially when it has to do with things like religion and like really sexual tendencies and um yeah this whole like love life romantic thing it like it gets me little bit sad sometimes that don't have anybody um but also like know people are out there and it gonna be tough and but do need to have that experience so it just really interesting the things that have been on my mind rea like academics are really important but at the same time used to feel like i'm missing something that i'd love to have so we'll see interesting day i'm really tired ready to go to bed um yeah just like didn't do as much work as hoped to today had some interesting conversations with my friends um regarding other friends that have and you know whether those friends should be friendship should be like stronger relationships in the future and like romantic relationships and how dangerous that may be for me um so like appreciate my friends looking out for me of course um and think some time they're like that dose of reality that need but also like really wanna feel wanted and think do feel lonely but like i'm surrounded by friends but want to be wanted romantically so that something that i'm grappling with um uh yeah just need to be little bit more productive tomorrow lot more productive actually so i'm going to go to bed pretty okay day today was not as productive as i'd hoped struggling with math set we had total new topic that have never learned and it quite difficult um had lot of experience today with males went out with my male friend and his male friend who is interested in me um thankfully was able to bring one of my friends along 'cause didn't feel like was gonna be okay by myself so that was really great um something else that happened today yeah just like really wanted to do my work and spend lot of time on organizing how was gonna do my work um but then didn't actually do lot of it um until got back home um but like feel better now that it like pretty much organized and done and can just go and do things and like trust that it the right time to do it and stuff um but yeah i'm just like really not feeling good and think not sleeping is catching up to me and i'm like shaking right now so yeah um spent most of the day by myself today just doing work um working my calendar trying to figure out what work to do and realizing that definitely still need help with this process of organizing all the work that do and moving it back and it feels helpful little bit but i'm also definitely stressed about it um so i'm trying to get around that but did some work that due tuesday today so that was great um which isn't that far out but it feels farther out also definitely sick quite sick actually and think need to go to health services um have pretty bad cough ne used my inhaler today which am not as mad at getting worse so that definitely problem um other things that did today went to the gym uh really spent most of my time by myself but was doing homework and found that lot of the work that had to do it was me like giving myself incentives to do my work so i'd like give myself like treat or whatever after doing certain amount of work um which is terrible 'cause don't know if that means have drive or don't have drive um but other than that um it really just me today mostly and then had like dinner with all of my friends and did like tiny bit of homework with re with them but yeah um spent most of the day by myself today attempting to do work um i'm pretty sick went to the health center today but [inaudible] 'cause felt like had lot of work to do 'cause went to get my flu shot but then you shouldn't get your flu shot while you're sick so decided against that um but yeah basically spent lot of time doing the same piece of homework today and so like was happy because had finished the work that was due tomorrow li-like at really good time like seven something but still have lot of other work to do and i'm still struggling with econ and like i'm like getting better think but i'm definitely still behind or like not where i'd like to be so that something that i'm struggling with other than that just like went to dinner with my friends and then did homework in the women center and that was probably the most productive think we've ever been which was awesome but yeah i'm just really sick and need to get more sleep pretty lonely day today spent most of my time on the homework grind just doing work um going to study hours to realize that study hours are not there um but yeah i'm like getting ahead of my work but i'm still not as ahead as i'd like to be like really wanna be studying for econ but feel like there no time to and now that have like my schedule organized and stuff still don't think there time which is little bit nerve-racking um it actually quite nerve-racking but yeah today was was lonely like got good amount of work done was happy uh not quite and so that definitely something that i'm struggling with um yeah but other than that did end up seeing one friend today oh no couple of friends today um but you know it definitely things are changing and not like badly or positively it just that like with school life like balancing schoolwork and social life it really hard when you're always surrounded by your friends so that something i'm struggling with but yeah um today spent most of the time by myself um knowing that had an event tonight that was from 800 to 1000 that was socializing made sure to do all my homework that was due tomorrow yesterday um and get some work done today that due tuesday although didn't do lot of the work that due friday i'm still really uh struggling with econ and feel like just stare at the problems and don't know what to do with them mean i've been slowly moving through but definitely not at pace that'll get me done by myself by noon on friday or by 1100 on friday um so that the [inaudible] math is getting hard really fast everything just changing um but yeah really spent most of the time by myself feeling like i'm not having enough time to do my work and now not only is it family weekend my friends wanna hang out um my family wants to hang out at the same time and like don't even know what going on i'm just going day by day which is mo like scary and don't like it because there so much happening all the time um so definitely have this stress around me that just like go go go go go even when you're ahead of the game you're behind studied really hard for my math exam um got it back today and only got an 87 was like are you kidding me so out of 66 points so like the points small loss in points makes bigger impact on the grade but thought i'd get an at least but that okay um yeah just like going along this thing that we had tonight was um couple of like black students got together seniors brought some freshmen together and it was good group of boys and girls just you know hanging out and chilling and kinda liked it was like kickback so we just sat there there was alcohol there didn't drink any but like someone gave me sip of their like wine or something but that was it really didn't want that um but didn't feel pressured either which was really awesome um sat there and drank my juice and it was great um but yeah no that was definitely met lot of new kids today don't really know or like five or six kids guess um and yeah that about it um so the day is basically done saw none of my close friends today um except for one that saw during um econ review for [p-set] we have due tomorrow and that was pretty short-lived as well um i'm feeling really terrible definitely miss my friends today um but like i'm quite sick my body not healing itself um my skin is turning to trash um feel really fat pretty sure i'm getting my period but like nothing happening 'cause i'm irregular but nobody believes me and my symptoms for my period are pretty bad and know they're gonna get bad and think should be on birth control but don't even know what resources to go to get that here um yeah basically my health is just like really bothering me right now and like my workload i'm not happy with it either so yeah today was very different day and didn't feel happy at one point but did speak to both my parents today um saw my cousin from [redacted] had dinner with her and my dad we spoke little bit it was like little bit awkward but not really um that just kind of how we are but yeah just don't even know how to feel about today yeah couldn't even be productive because had so much stuff to do but now i'm done with all my work i'm just gonna take shower and go to bed but yeah um pretty okay day today saw my parents um we hung out for bit and realized that miss them little bit wasn't sure if it i'd like guess miss the idea of having parents and like not that they like do things for me but other people were like i'm with my family or like met my friend little brother today and he was like such cute person to know you know it such great connection and was like yeah guess do miss my family miss being around them but like wouldn't want to be in the same place that was before either way so like it just like weird thing to think about because don't really get homesick and it not really homesickness that i'm feeling it more of this like like you guys don't talk to you guys lot um other thing is went out tonight wasn't as productive as i'd liked to be today um got an econ tutor most amazing person so good i'm so excited and uh went out tonight realizing that like do like this guy and like even though don't think he is quite like perfect for me like want someone in my life and want him to be that person because trust him but wonder if if want him to be that person 'cause he the only person that know but like you know so definitely struggling with that but it is what it is um today was stressful was not super fun but mean it was okay it parents' weekend so was just with my family lot and was reminded basically how glad am to be here not living with my family um but just mentally straining day i'm just like mentally exhausted emotionally exhausted and didn't go out tonight 'cause just didn't think i'd be able to have good time in the state that i'm in and didn't wanna spread that to anybody else um but [redacted] my friend called me after to make sure was okay and stuff and that was great um also hung out lot with male friend my parents met that male friend vice versa as in his parents met me they really liked each other or no they really like me my parents really like him but you know here we are not making moves with each other he not moving forward um that struggling that something i'm struggling with just wish he would do something forward um yeah that something that just been on the back burner for while got no work done today at all so that was awesome just just completely awesome but yeah feel super prepared for the week do feel confident with myself was basically fat-shamed all day so uh my parents want me to go the gym every day my mum has sent me meal plan uh no sweets just water um so yeah don't know what i'm gonna do but will be at the gym tomorrow morning so exciting um pretty interesting day today to-today was the last day of parents weekend think don't know my parents were here they had this you know big talk with me about um that i'm not quite being my best self here and should get more involved in opportunities and just remember who am and not to get lost in these things and not to just uh be part of organizations that are all black need to make white friends also need to exercise and just like lot of things and like think kind of needed it little bit um so like i'm not mad at them or anything but didn't knew it needed to happen but really wasn't ready for it to happen but um yeah mean that was just me basically [inaudible] to get my [inaudible] and they were just like stop hanging out with your friends so much and [inaudible] get involved email your buddy blah blah blah so mean i'm really grateful in the end and when i'm going to be new person things may be little bit different in terms of how much i'm hanging out with my friends who i'm hanging out with um for the next bit but know that also need to um do this for myself and start defining self-care as putting myself first academically and and in every other endeavor and not just physically which is also not going very well because can't really take care of myself physically because i'm breaking out overweight whatever it is what it is but yeah so new outlook on life for tomorrow um pretty good day today felt really good after working out the day felt longer felt like had more time um don't love how late i'm going to bed right now because will be waking up early in the morning um saw less friends today almost none really um but got some work done um not as far ahead as uh that i'd like to be but definitely got some work done and am hoping that this process you know gets better and feels more comfortable and things um but so far i'm really liking it and connecting to people to get involved in my extracurricular [inaudible] and had like pretty good conversation with my male friend um and it was just like that was like my guess my study break if you wanna call it that um and think it went little over time but did like it and liked reading with him so it ended up being okay but other than that it was pretty normal day didn't really see much of my friends and wonder if this is gonna be the new norm hmm yeah don't know if that good thing or bad thing right now so that something i'm struggling with but other than that not much um today was pretty interesting didn't really hang out with any of my friends today um did see my dad and after class um went with him guess he was just checking in on me making sure things were going okay that i'm getting involved in things and it was nice it wasn't bad at all um yeah feel like i'm really getting things done which is really good feeling um and think it coming little bit at the cost of hanging out with my friends and don't i'm not upset about it or sad about it yet think um but i'm hoping that can find that balance but as of right now really just need to settle down and focus so i'm not really spending my time thinking about what could be doing without my friends because know what want and need to be doing um so mean think that like more of good thing than bad thing but um other things mean so talked to some of my friend today who really close with me who met here and was just like hope you're alive hope you're okay whatever miss you um and think she being alone lot more now and think that bothering her and she somebody who not really great by herself um and think earlier was willing to help her by being with her but at the cost of me doing well which is troublesome but miss her and love hanging out with her so think have to find that balance as well but yeah it just like really interesting feeling where i'm like i'm alone but i'm also meeting new people and like sat with somebody who haven't spoken with in while because she didn't really get along with friend group that had been hanging out with and it was just like it was cool it was relaxed him and another person as well yeah think i'm broadening my friend groups and i'm not leaving the other ones behind i'm just spreading out guess so this is new and right now as of right now i'm not hating it so think that good um today felt okay again i'm spending more time by myself don't really know how feel about it so i'm just like really really tired and being dedicated to the gym i'm still not getting as much sleep as had hoped um but yeah am like i've seen couple of my friends today and like very quickly see most members but like don't know it just doesn't feel the same and don't want things to fall apart 'cause really really love having them around love being their friend and love how feel when i'm around them but i'm afraid that things are going to fall apart just 'cause we're not spending that much time together anymore and it really it sad am sad about it um because miss them lot but it not like they don't live like mean they they all live like 30 seconds from me but it just don't know i'm afraid that things will change and i'm sad without them i'm probably little bit more productive without them but didn't think that would have to fall off entirely but think like what i'm going through think everybody else is as well where like they're also not spending that much time with other people so it just like don't know it just me getting around that and i'm just little bit saddened by it but other than that really spend most of my time by myself doing homework no yeah that about it and eating i'm really trying to pay attention to how eat um yeah definitely feel like maybe have been overeating in the past couple weeks so i'm trying to do like portion control figure out what i'm going to eat before get into the dining hall because i'm really trying to lose weight now because i've gained the freshman 15 so need to lose that asap also my skin is terrible um feel better now that i'm working out and like feel less stressed but i'm tired and don't see my skin improving don't even know if i'm healthy or not haven't had my period in over month and half so yeah just don't know what going on at all with my body and usually when there something wrong with me and like through my body that usually tells me that there something that i'm trying to cope with mentally but usually don't like push feelings away so much don't really feel things but they come about through my body which means that i'll have to figure out what is bothering me um which is going to be really really hard so yeah um today was an interesting day saw some of my friends earlier this morning some new friends some um normal ones guess my normal group um but yeah i'm just doing work today felt pretty good with econ like sat down and did it and found that really could do some um which was really really great thing to see um like could do the work by myself basically and that made me feel good um going to the gym keep looking at the scale waiting for me to lose weight kind of hard um so i'm struggling little bit i'm yeah basically just really missed my friends spoke to one of them today and was just like i'm just like scared you know i'm like scared that we're not gonna be friends and that like things are gonna fall apart was like really love the people that i've built relationships with and like she like reassured me that that wouldn't happen but mean how much can we really say isn't gonna happen so and think that was something that was bothering me unconsciously but yeah i'm just trying to like get around this this hump getting involved in things there just so much to do all the time i'm sore i'm tired i'm waking up have to go to bed early wake up early but like like it like the length of the days like the way wake up you know there more structure and appreciate it but yeah that just my days um social things really not much has happened spending lot more time by myself now pretty good day today um got some work done for econ started my math [pisa] um but also spent some time with my dad spent some time with my friend and spoke to her about my dilemma that was having with just like not just not seeing her but like while we were walking back and she was like going back to her dorm i'm not really sure where we were going um she was like okay are you gonna head home now or and was like well she said where are we going and was like i'm going to [can today] she was like okay i'll see you later and was like you're not coming with she was like didn't know if you wanted me to and like that made me really frustrated and it was the first time think felt like mad and it wasn't wasn't mad at her was just mad at like the situation and you know it was just like the culmination of like this is exactly what like not only what was afraid of but what think thought [wasn't] gonna happen with her and also her relationship with her boyfriend and like she has no idea how much people want to be around her and i'm such an hypocrite but like it just it really really bothered me and like at first just like started like running up and down stairs and just like being like no it fine i'm fine like just needed like walked away from her multiple times and then eventually she like grabbed hold of me and was like just need you to tell me and was just like don't understand why you're pushing people away or like it wasn't that it was that like know she not trying to push people away but like how does she have no idea how great she is and how much people wanna be around her and ended up crying for her and was just like saddened by it because she has no idea and she so dependent on her boyfriend view of her that she has no idea what happening and she also [chaining] herself for this guy who doesn't even text to say how are you doing and so that was something that really like shook me today that was like my fresh air of emotion and then also hung out with some other friends for little bit in different social group and basically told them my life story of like my parents and like family structure family struggles of course and it was just like it was fine but usually when talk about those things i'm like really okay and it like doesn't bother me but like today could not shake it off after spoke about it and that something that doesn't usually happen so like was just don't know what and so like after hanging out with them after told them just couldn't be happy couldn't dance around or with them and then it just like felt like don't know and this guy is like still somebody that wanna be with and have relationship with but like it made me wonder if i'm enough if i'm like even confident enough to be with him and will ever be comfortable enough to be with him 'cause i'm so different like we don't don't just like dance you know what mean don't don't do those things and that his norm so yeah those are my social struggles today but it getting better feel good i've made amends so it all right pretty interesting day today um didn't get as mu actually no ended up getting the work done that wanted to um studied little bit made me feel little bit more inconfident though um went to play with um male friend the same one as usual and uh it was really interesting it was about like these kids who are in very conservative religious school and setting um and their parents didn't really tell them about sex or anything so when they came about it um it was just like it was very interesting it was really basically about how like not telling the truth hurts you in the end but um there was some um don't know the it had little bit to do with like domestic violence and like sexual abuse and i'm like usually fine with that from my past but like this time guess like and didn't even notice um but he told me after he said that like while that scene was happening like was shaking my leg he can tell that like was kinda like breathing faster or whatever and like i've just never noticed that so that was very interesting but like also he noticed that but he didn't do anything about it he said like he thought he was gonna put his hand on my leg but then he was like but know you're not on that wave essentially meaning that i'm not interested in him which is completely false and he knows that but um yeah also saw another male friend today that think should be more interested in than am i'm just really struggling with balancing social life and like feel like it all coming at me but also have lot to do and like don't know how to have time for these things yet like really want relationship for some unknown reason um but yeah things are like changing really just wanna get do really well in this econ exam that what i'm hoping to do uh yeah must just just must but yeah that about it pretty interesting day today was very relaxed but still got stuff done which was good pretty interesting day today um got some homework done did some studying feeling like it paid off little bit i'm understanding things um hung out with my mom today went shopping to get clothes for conference have next weekend let see yeah it was just like wasn't as productive but like it was at the same time also went to an event today um called the road to success and listened to these three speakers and it was just really really awesome to to be there and felt sort of re-inspired which think is really exciting um but yeah am just spent most of my time with my mom didn't see many of my friends today saw one friend and we went to the event together then we got food together then we departed and realized don't really know how to say goodbye to people without it being awkward so that new um yeah it pretty mediocre day but like good mediocre day pretty um okay day today did lot of studying for econ still feeling little bit ill-prepared but less ill-prepared than before and am yeah today was like pretty busy saw couple of my friends today and hung out with some new friends and yeah hmm really didn't do much today other than work went back to the gym this morning it was hard i'm getting heart pains like used to again um feel like i'm stressed about something but i'm not quite sure what it is got this like anxious feeling usually when get my heart spells that because i'm stressed so i've gotta figure that out um but yeah i'm just really tired really wanna get to bed um but also i've so much work to do and feel uh like there really not enough time to do it um which is really scary have like mini-paper thing due wednesday have an econ exam due wednesday have emails to send [inaudible] it just so much um basically just feel extremely overwhelmed but yeah um today was super busy day um just really had lot to do thing after thing after thing did lot of work got my work done um which is good don't really feel prepared for econ tomorrow so have to wake up early and study for that for sure um and don't think i'll ever feel like incredibly prepared but um it i've gotta do that it gonna happen but yeah i'm kinda nervous about it but at the same time like feel like there are things that know you know and when went and did um like office hours with my tf like was able to say some things which is very rare so like there is definitely improvement um but i'm so really nervous about it and really wanna do well and met with the personal trainer today so i'm gonna be doing that [i assume] once week our goal is to lose 15 pounds and don't know yeah just getting [fit] guess prepare for lacrosse maybe um other things yeah i'm just like really tired my body hurts uh and really really want to do well on this econ exam so i'm really gonna try my best but yeah that really all i'm really thinking about um yesterday somebody called me square which essentially is somebody that not very interesting and is boring and today when saw that same person and was like happy energetic my usual self they called me polygon which guess was compliment but like i'm not boring person but if seem boring is 'cause you don't know me so that something that definitely stuck with me today um but yeah also had really good interaction with those people today and like just like different people than normal but yeah i'm just kinda doing my own thing currently don't know how feel about it but it happening so yeah um pretty not stressful day today but interesting day today spent most of my day studying for my econ exam which was also today um and had studied for it earlier but just wanted to get more in 'cause really really wanted to do well um paid off bit there were definitely some things knew definitely some things didn't know um but that okay like figured out my mistakes along the way and just tried to keep going and did as much as could lot of people struggled with it which think was okay um but yeah so now i'm just currently being sexiled from my room but really wanna go to bed 'cause have to wake up and go to the gym tomorrow 'cause didn't go this morning 'cause really wanted to study and went to bed late as well um tomorrow no excuses but um yeah i'm just like really tired um hang out little bit today with my big sibling in the association of black women of harvard um with two of my other friends and kinda felt like my big sib was lot closer with the friend that consider myself very close to and like it was fine and everything but don't know it just didn't give me great feeling felt like was kind of useless um and pointless which was yeah like said was saddening but not really things can do about it um other than that yeah mean really just spent lot of my day studying today didn't get to see my male friend that usually see every day um and yeah so that was unfortunate as well but i'm also yesterday somebody approached me and gave me their number so that was new and think they're really attractive and they're pretty nice person during my math class so he pretty cool guy um yeah yeah that basically what going on in my life trying not to pick at my face but that currently what happening um which is bad 'cause my skin was doing great and shall continue to do so if stop touching it but it addictive but other than that things have been like really like slow today [i didn't love it] don't feel very good about my body today either so something else [inaudible] want to eat 'cause knew hadn't worked out which is kind of even more [inaudible] think but yeah pretty busy day today barely did any work um quite problematic have thing due sunday i'm really struggling with it it more creative than anything else so have to write um poem by spoken word and i'm struggling with the poem hard thing about that you can't really rush art so i'm kind of in jiffy currently [inaudible] stress about it too much i'm just really tired struggling with male friends um the one guy that i've been like hanging out with lot kind of like him or whatever don't know guess he just like an entire paradox and he reminds me way too much of my father for me to like him yet do and don't want to fall into the same position that my mother fell in so this is me trying to um just stop that by not like falling off or like cutting him off of my list but just keeping it platonic [inaudible] platonic just need to keep him as friend and just friend and cut off that interest 'cause today when found out that he could possibly be talking to another girl just got really upset and like not even upset guess was sad and like didn't know why and then realized why was sad and it wasn't because he was with another girl it was more that he was lying to me this whole time and saying that he wasn't ready for relationship yet or yada yada but here am hearing from other people that he pursuing this girl or this girl pursuing him and he letting her do that so just like this is the first time something like this has ever happened to me and it makes me feel little bit like i'm not enough but know that completely false so like what am worried about um but do really wish had significant other like seriously it just really i'm forced to be lonely all the time which is crazy to think about because i've never had relationship so why am missing something that i've never had but who knows what going on with my life right now um today was eventful um sort of just like continuation of last night um and we had conversation me and this guy was really hopeful but just feel really bad feel like did something wrong that things are gonna be different now but um at the same time like i'm also sort of seeing some similarities between this and me and my and my mom and my dad and that scares the heck out of me um but [inaudible] that like just hung out with some friends that are not quite in my friend group but really enjoyed it think like them but one of the girls has been ostracized from my friend group due to some of her previous actions in the beginning of the year um but think did [inaudible] and think it was good opportunity to do so currently i'm just super tired and i'm feeling like some men are just not great for me but i'm also sort of in this loop where like there somebody who wants me and whatever but is not ready to be in relationship then there somebody who think is attractive don't know if they like me but like hasn't done anything but whatever i'm struggling basically [inaudible] like wanna make out with somebody wanna love somebody want somebody to love me and to want me i'm just feeling little unloved right now and that hard um today was okay and got some work done on this essay that i'm really struggling with got an extension on it um am yeah just came back from hanging out with some friends different friend group went to dinner for my friend birthday today um one of my other friends is really struggling with her relationship so that was kind of hard to see but feel like just have lot work to do and i'm trying to be productive that is quite hard on the weekends and [inaudible] even and i'm super tired but i've like lot of work to do tomorrow so will be up late doing so much work um let see other than that things have been okay i've been like talking to some other guys um but the guy that have like known and i'm actually friends with realize still have some tendencies occasionally for so that rough but yeah just don't know what to do what gonna happen with anything so i'm just sort of taking things the way they go not [inaudible] anything too much 'cause it just hurts me in the end so figured not to give anything too much weight but i'm also this is weird to say and really don't enjoy saying it out loud 'cause it just it weird but i'm like quite horny which is don't know it not bad but like guess i'm just really craving don't know kissing or something but i've never done that which is weird so yeah i'm just like in very weird position right now really tired haven't stayed up this late in long time have lot of work um don't like saving my work to the last minute and that definitely what today was result of so definitely won't do that i'm gonna try to get ahead with my work so don't have that much to do this weekend um hopefully can actually follow through with that plan um but yeah other than that i'm just really trying to focus on work went to my professor house today and it was absolutely amazing um not only was his home beautiful and his like family was just amazing and warm and welcoming and everything was you know set um it reminded me little bit of home in terms of not necessarily like rhode island but what that image of success looks like again and like why tried so hard to get here and what i'm hoping for and like how happy and safe wanna feel and so that just sort of like revived things for me which was amazing and also like hung out with different people got little bit closer with the other kids and that was awesome so like yeah today was like really interesting experience had lot of work but my time was well-spent think was pretty productive today didn't do lot of work with friends other than math which is like study group and like the math questions on there were like you're kind of doing things on your own other people are just kind of there and they're like tas answering questions so yeah today was pretty good day super super exhausted um finished most of my work that due tomorrow just have really short reading have to do but i'm so exhausted have to go to bed [inaudible] wake up tomorrow to run have really busy day tomorrow um and it terms of today uh went to this meeting [inaudible] politics um with the secretary of health um donna shalala and that was really awesome um just to hear her experience coincidentally one of my guy friends also ended up being chosen from the lottery to go so it was just really interesting um haven't seen my other friend group in while and my roommate made really good point today after expressed um some worries about the friend group as in things just felt different and felt sort of out of the loop because hadn't you know been with them as much as maybe they had been with each other or something um she said you don't have friend groups you have individual friends and they can get together and you can all be friends but you don't have friend groups and that was awesome she just so incredible and she always has good insights and that made me feel lot better and um made me reevaluate you know how perceive friends and friend groups and how don't need to be like groupie guess don't even know what groupie is but that how i'm gonna use the word um yeah other than that i'm genuinely exhausted and i'm also feeling like and i'm just evaluating my friend groups and like with my guy friend who saw at the meeting um it was just like really inspiring you know and he like he driven guess and was really driven and feel like lost little bit of that so i'm trying to get it back my other friends don't quite see that as much um and he also really wants to be president and wanna be in government so like that like similarity that we have obviously i'm not necessarily in the same page but either way um but there also some tension there as in like he'll say things like oh [will she] be like don't know the secretary of education or the first lady and things like that which is like interesting don't know just don't know what to think so i'm interested in this other guy now and now it feels like that i'm ready to move on he ready to get started with me and don't like that so yeah today was okay pretty structured was very busy had lot of things to do um didn't get lot of work done as had hoped to um but still making progress trying to prepare for the game this weekend think it gonna be really hard to do work so i'm just trying to prepare for that is it going well not quite um also saw made deeper connection with uh one of my friends who kinda felt like was worried about um as close as yesterday so mean that was good we sort of just like straightened things out um and yeah so got some closure got closer in other relationships and things um but yeah most things really was just really busy with school met some really awesome person um who is running for governor in colorado and was really inspired by them so emailed them see if can help them over the summer with their campaign and such and that was really exciting it such great experience like was just so happy that was taking the class but also that like they were so open to uh help and just just hearing the details and they shared details of like where to go from where you are now is really something that made me feel really excited super busy day today um really just class class meeting meeting um mainly it kind of catching up where like don't have time for some homework sometimes which is really not great really don't love going to bed this late um yeah i'm really just not feeling it at all so hopefully that'll change also my face is breaking out don't know if it stress or what but that that annoying as well um so hopefully that'll fix itself just have lot to do have midterm tomorrow feel semi-prepared for but really don't know i'm just like nervous guess but yeah hopefully things go well and in terms of social things didn't see lot of my friends today saw one of my friends at um dinner just by coincidence [inaudible] so could go get tutoring um got my econ back as an actual grade like in the raw score it not very good but in the scale am like pretty average like got minus with the scale which think is huge improvement for me definitely still wanna do better but it did give me little bit of confidence saying that like okay you can improve like yeah the course itself sucks and the way they manage it sucks but like you can get better so yeah um pretty all right day today was really busy with just work and classes didn't have lot of time to do homework which is pattern that i'm starting to see um which is little bit problematic so need to fix that um my friend was leaving today to go home and we just talked about how it'd be kind of weird and then thought about thanksgiving and uh how it would be weird for me as well but haven't really given much thought to it um yes i'm gonna miss hit lot but um it really important that he does this it big deal and yeah he kinda just was like you mean lot to me and like really um rock with you on deeper level than even thought did and that was sort of news for me and makes me rethink what wanna do with other guys and stuff um but yeah just really wanna get work done harvard [inaudible] is this weekend so i'm trying to get ahead and work and as result did not work today which was really unfortunate but hopefully i'll be able to get some work done tomorrow um and yeah went out to dinner today with my friends 'cause it was my friend birthday um upcoming events that have in mind really is just like tests like and like big projects really wanna do really well and realize that it little late but really want to um so i'm going to work on that which means i'm starting early with everything but yeah um pretty interesting day today didn't get any work done um went to bed really late last night so had hard time waking up this morning didn't wake up early didn't go to the gym um again did not do any homework was not as productive as i'd hoped to be but then again also didn't have much time had to pack um pick up some things um definitely feeling stressed about social situations more so than academic situations um really struggling with like love life um friends little bit there was like little bit of tension about getting on certain buses to get to harvardyale which is this weekend something else was little bit worried about was um like being parent this weekend and just like looking out for my friends and making sure that they're not like too drunk or whatever but think that was mostly in my head um and think they're gonna be fine but like even if things do happen i'm okay with being that person one because care about them and two like what else am gonna be doing so yeah i'm just taking it day by day um i'm definitely every day wishing more that was in relationship but that that like low-key stressed about school as in like really wanna get my grades up and it like not even like what it used to be where it like need to get my grades up or whatever it like want to genuinely want to do well 'cause like like the classes and wish that my work reflected that um but yeah pretty interesting day today um we went to the harvard-yale game today which was in um [redacted] so yesterday went on the bus there today um woke up we went to get breakfast after waiting little too long for some of my friends to get ready then we went to the complex uh which was where the game was went to the tailgates went to the game for little bit then went back to the tailgates um and really it was just like lot of dancing dancing with people um lots of alcohol everywhere didn't drink don't feel pressured to drink either which was really great and also didn't have to be parent to any of my friends which would not have minded but um it was cool that that didn't happen and then let see um yeah also hung out with [girlfriend] one-on-one today we just got some food and watched some netflix that was about it new friend different friend group it felt comfortable you know it felt kinda normal which is good um one of my friends today this this was the last day that would see her um until after thanksgiving break and was really sad about it um and like met her here so she friend that made here during the peer rotation program and we've gotten really close um and cried cried twice actually and it only gonna be like 10 or so days or something but like don't know was just like really really saddened by that and it makes me really worried for like uh winter break even spring break you know it just like you get so close to these people 'cause you're always with them always surrounded by them so like days apart from them really feels like months 'cause time goes so quickly yet so slowly here um other than that yeah kinda just like wanted to hang out with guy not hang out with guys but like do things with guys this weekend and didn't and that okay think i'm okay with that decision i'm not sure why really wanted to in the first place um so that was an internal strife had but yeah got over it um not any drama today well actually um today some girls were looking for the bus to get back home so they were calling texting had me share my location with them and things so finally when me who had been there for an hour waiting the bus wa for the bus was ready to get on they weren't responding to me so called to make sure that they got on the bus and they were already on it they were like oh yeah we're already on the bus um and then said okay is there room for three more 'cause thought we were all planning on sitting together and they were like no really don't think so which you know that was weird within itself just not great experience 'cause like we spent lot of time helping them standing in the rain waiting for them for them to already be there and not say anything and then on top of that once actually get on the bus guess who there both of them just like really an interesting experience and like spoke to my friend about it who was also there it was like we [inaudible] fre fake friends from an incident that happened with them way in the beginning of the year that [inaudible] guy drama but essentially has to do with trust and communication once again so that was something to think um pretty relaxed day today spent most of my time by myself woke up kind of early at first for fire alarm then went back to bed after that and feel like got pretty good night rest despite that interruption um but yeah mean really spent most my time by myself and just did homework got little bit ahead which is good but also i'm kinda not stressed 'cause like thanksgiving and it doesn't really feel real but know that like don't know like i'm doing my work but don't need to be that far ahead um on top of that also made plans with somebody for tomorrow night which is new thing for me 'cause usually [inaudible] like school night to school night but already have that much homework anyways so it'll be okay um yeah so other than that like genuinely did not do much today like at all and was actually okay with that you know was just like really relaxed just doing my thing and yeah also spoke to my friend lot um over the phone he talking listening to his dad tell stories and stuff really nervous feel like i'm dealing with two guys right now and one doesn't want to be in relationship yet but is still calling me things like wifey and whatever and then another one is interested and i'm interested as well and he somebody that doesn't remind me of my father who was like somewhat abusive and things so think it something that should go for because don't wanna be in the same position that my mom was in so that something that like [redacted] stressing in the back of my mind but don't really know but um yeah so i'm trying to pursue the second one we'll see what happens well yeah and then that-that been my pretty chillax day so on walk home now just watched two movies with this guy and just kinda snuggled or whatever which was fine feeling okay except that i'm walking home by myself and know that the other guy that know is unhealthy for me um would have never let me walk home by myself but it is what it is and it was just too much stimulation guess so yeah i'm walking home i'm feeling don't know how i'm feeling but i'm okay um yeah i'm just other than that today has been really relaxed day um got my homework done for tomorrow like so early which was awesome and think it because had knew that won't be able to do work tonight so guess that good for my work ethic you know knowing that like when need to get stuff done get it done so yeah pretty okay day today pretty normal um i'm home um because it thanksgiving break so i'm just reading currently but today was pretty relaxed day went to class and didn't really see anybody today met some people at lunch ended up hanging out with them but that was pure coincidence um yeah it was just me today really packing and getting ready and struggling bit with one of my guy friends and understanding what he wants from me if he wants me to wait for him in terms of having relationship or just do whatever and so he saying not to wait for me and that you know when he ready he'll he'll come for me so that makes things easier with my other friend um yeah so that was really the only stress went through today didn't do lot of homework um but i'm planning on being productive tomorrow we will see how that goes so yeah um i'd say it wasn't bad went to breakfast with my dad woke up kind of late went to bed late as well though um let see saw some friends saw lot of friends actually was so happy to see them um just reminded me of who used to be who was and who still am guess and the people that have helped me become who am and just like the amazingness that i've come from and felt strong again feel like can go back into the world and remember who [redacted] was who she stands for and such um yeah it was just like such great experience like i'm so happy saw them and like yes we've gotten older but have we changed absolutely not and really appreciate that about my friends and think they're so real for it so just feel very grateful um also saw some family unfortunately all they ask is how [redacted] better get all as how [redacted] so that was that but things happen um pretty short-ish day today would say um woke up little bit late tried to do some homework facetimed friends and family spoke to friends on the phone so really only got one piece of work done today so wasn't super productive spent time with my family um which is good little bit of fear of missing out north carolina with the rest of my family but i'm also glad i'm here and can just go home whenever um yeah talking to my friend-ish i'm not sure what to call him yet but i've been liking [inaudible] stuff and he expressed that he like misses me he calls me beautiful or whatever and like which is nice he just great person but feel like don't know him so i'm struggling with that bit but yeah and i'm just really ready to go to bed after going black friday shopping and being utterly unsuccessful um pretty relaxed day today went shopping with my mom spent some quality time with her which was good watched movies it was very relaxed ate pretty normal amount um yeah today was just like lot of doing the same thing so like we were just shopping like walking around the mall expressing disappointment as black friday often causes um yeah really like nothing today spoke to my friend um over text lot and like him he likes me we're aware of that um don't really know we're not like in relationship or anything or dating or anything but definitely building towards something which is new for me but i'm feeling this feeling that haven't felt before with guy where just like don't know he just really cute and like he makes my heart smile little bit and um that new um but other than that yeah actually been dodging calls today from the other guy who i'm just friends with but um still just like too much calling don't wanna talk on the phone all the time but yeah um pretty okay day today went to the stores with my mom spent some quality time with her um spoke lot to um one of my friends um got to see my friends that haven't seen in really long time um once got back to campus which was super exciting and really didn't feel lot of stress today got some work done keep forgetting that it saturday um which guess unintentionally i've been using as an excuse to not work as hard and be okay with not doing as much which is problematic but that okay it not okay actually um but yeah definitely did get some work done today and and hoping to get more done tomorrow but yeah everything seems all right um pretty interesting day today friend slept over went to the gym then uh we'll tried to go to the gym multiple times then just went for an actual run and then went to brunch then did homework went to uh dinner and did more homework went to math question center facetimed friend who interested in me um have no idea if i'm interested in him also don't know how to do these things and i'm feeling really stressed about that situation like extremely stressed out to the point where like don't know what i'm feeling and i'm like well not angry but i'm just like frustrated because don't know what to do and just like yeah and i'm just like yeah just wish knew what to do guess but other than that nothing incredibly crazy has really happened today i've genuinely just been stressed about the situation um but now that it happened i'm like don't know how feel about him don't even know if i'm interested in him don't see what he sees in me just really nerve-racking but it is what it is apparently um pretty stressful day today went to the gym i'm getting bigger which is not good um also had lot of social um discussions or like stress guess um had good conversation with one of my friends who haven't really connected with in the level that we have before in quite some time and you know we both related on the struggles that we have with our family and our family structure and mental and physical abuse and and parents and fathers and things and um had been noticing something in this one guy that have been hanging out with where he did lot of things that are very similar to the things that my father did and i've tried to push it away and tried to ignore the signs but it was there and when she had told me that she'd recognized some of those same traits um it kind of hit me hard and my other friend have been saying like oh you know don't don't just ignore those signs yada yada yada but they don't have that experience so like understood it and like knew they were looking out for me but also knew that they were on my side and they didn't really like him whereas this girl pretty good friends with this guy um and like pretty good friends with me but she also relates to me on that level of understanding what it like to have parents like that so um that was just really eye-opening to me and really stressful and just like made lot of tension at dinner like moving uh just moving around and like being pulled aside and asked to talk and just having hostile hostile situation where just didn't enjoy it but after that kind of just isolated myself went to meeting where felt so inspired and so great and so ready to work and like just grind and really do well and and it it was meeting with the whole bunch of kids from the undergraduate council um and they're just doing awesome things and that we're working on getting multicultural center here and they were like you should run for uc and was like you know what what is stopping me other than fear so just felt reinspired and made me feel lot more determined to do my work and get it all done so now i'm heading to bed and feel accomplished because pretty much crossed off everything on my list pretty interesting day today um super busy which really loved was doing stuff was productive to degree socialized enough had great dinner with my teacher some new friends which is really exciting it was awesome um also had weird interaction with one guy friend the newer one um and we're at the mqc and he finished his thing at 830 and it was the time was approaching 1015 and was like oh when did you finish your pset and he said 830 and said what are you still doing here and he took that as like why are you here in like negative way and didn't mean that but that how he took it and he kind of well he didn't storm off immediately but he like slowly like packed up and whatever and didn't really say that he was upset about it but could tell um so that was weird and then texted him later about it and he was just like no just really missed you and like knew took it the wrong way but that was just straight in the moment yada yada yada and was like okay i'm just really struggling with the idea of missing people that you don't know and don't know how this kid likes me when he doesn't know me and misses me when we barely had any like normal interactions so that something i'm like really struggling with um also the older the other guy um that like been here for quite some time and has been causing lot of my struggle um today asked if he could take me to play and then some dinner and he wants to take me out and that his dad said to him today um don't let [inaudible] be the one that got away whatever and was just getting over this hump of can't be with you right now i'm not ready you remind me too much of my dad yada yada so that little bit stressful but i'm also feeling great 'cause i'm just like was productive today it was just such balanced day and really loved it um yeah didn't really see lot of my like normal close friends though which just realized now but um yeah also have like lot of work to do but think should go to bed um then also have to gym and i'm overweight which the scale retold me today so that was exciting um but yeah so now need to figure out how to actually eat well today was an okay day um reconnected with friend that made kind of in the beginning of the year um she is really nice really like her um very much like the friends that had back home and here lot of my friends identify as the same race or identity um as do and she does not so that was nice and just sort of like it didn't matter didn't make difference obviously um but it made me feel like was branching out more so in the way that i'd like to um today also hit my head really hard um feeling concussioned-ish but we'll see what happens made doctor appointment um uh let see didn't really see lot of my other friends today um but just did work going to bed early because don't feel good because of my head which is unfortunate um have lot of papers to work on and feel like i've been like work on it little bit but don't know what that means and so i'm really struggling with actually working on it um also need to go to the gym i'm fat and there lot of fat on my stomach and don't like it i'm not used to that also late on my period since i'm kinda moody but also usually get frustrated really easily might have concussions have i've had four um and one of my friends has expressed interest in me and now wants to approach being in relationship um wanted me to come see him tonight and told him to come see me and at first he was like what and then he was like sure and he said he'd come um texted him three times and he hasn't responded which is abnormal from him um and he has test tomorrow so like i'm not mad but did get frustrated really easily and was just like what in the world is going on need to be held to the same standards that he held to so like when you come at me for not responding or not seeing you for day or something like this is two-way street you know hold some responsibility you have agency in this situation as well so like that don't know then with the other guy haven't spoken to him at all today don't really know what to do that experience had with him recently of him getting kind of frustrated because said why are you here not in that sense as in like and not sure if said this yesterday but was um at the mqc the math question center um got there kind of late around 900-ish and this guy was there um and it was around 1015 and was like hey like when did you finish the [psat] because he was finishing an essay and then he finished that he started playing on rubik cube he was like oh finished at 830 mind you mqc starts at 830 so was like what are you still doing here like you finished long ago and he took that as why are you here and um was like well can leave if you want and was like that not what meant at all um but like he didn't storm off or anything but he like went to the bathroom and obviously there was mood change he very like bubbly sort of light-hearted person and the person that interacted with after that was not that person um so just texted him about it and he was like oh i'm sorry just really miss you knew you didn't mean it that way as soon as walked out but just really miss you i'm not used to not seeing you this often and i'm just like confused as to like how do you miss somebody that you don't know how do you like somebody you don't know um so that been on my mind and feel like should confront that issue today was pretty great for most of the time um it was super busy jam-packed in the schedule first class well had meeting at 11 o'clock but her meeting before was going over so had to reschedule my first class at 1130 until 230 then from 300 to 400 had office hours 400 to 500 had class 500 to 800 had women center preparation for the event and then the event um 800 to 900 had an event for my path then 900 to 1030 had math question center and then that wasn't enough time for me so well no no actually 900 to 930 went to my um mandatory um study break for my entryway left early 'cause really had to do homework and then from 930 to 1030 was at the math question center until it closed then up until about like 10 15 minutes ago just left the library to finish the math homework um and my econ homework still have to do more econ tomorrow um didn't really see lot of my friends saw one in passing made some new friends saw some pretty good people and yeah saw another friend that was really good to see um little bit of tension with the weird situation or opportunity which is in general was talking about my computer screen background which was van gogh um and he was like you wanna see my background he was being playful and it was like picture of clearly him drawn and it was just funny this was like van gogh and then like picture that like ten-year-old could have drawn or something and he was like my girlfriend drew it or whatever and so some guys were laughing and they're like it probably the worst i've ever seen and don't know how he took it and don't know if he got mad or he just was like focused in his work um but that was sort of like weird situation he said he was fine but don't think he really was um but yeah and currently my friend this guy who i've been like he been pretty important part of my life for some time now for well my harvard time the guy that always influences my day somehow um he has been really weird lately and like hasn't been responding to me hasn't been trying to see me anymore or anything which is weird 'cause i'm not sure what did wrong or what did to change that and i'm just questioning everything now and this is directly after you said that he kinda wants to move forward with me so i'm just utterly confused but feel like i'm knowing great things here i'm feeling better about myself at harvard and i'm really okay with that uh pretty long day today class class meeting nap first successful nap it was amazing meeting um socializing with friends dinner wanted to do bit of work today definitely didn't get to do that was definitely feeling some symptoms of concussion i'm starting to feel it now should be taking things easy but of course didn't do that 'cause was struggling [essentially] with somebody kind of got [inaudible] but yeah now i'm just gonna go straight to bed this is too much um today was interesting started off okay got worse and worse as the day went on and i've been getting really frustrated really quickly um and suddenly and i'm not quite sure how to handle it um and feeling like i've had to cry for really long time can't really get there got mad at my friend in like split second today and then it was fine don't even know why got mad at her um then like bumped into them like literally minutes later and was like sorry like i'll see you guys later and she didn't say anything but the my other friend did and then it just reminded me of conversation had with someone that went on date with yesterday and just like how quickly people switch and how much hate that and how find that so scary and wonder if scared her and if things would be the same don't know um but yeah so that happened i'm stressing over writing this paper and just can't cannot get it do uh on the paper don't know what to say don't know how to write these types of papers um on top of that just feel really stressed don't feel good like i'm sick now can't focus um it hurts to look at screens for too long need to sleep my dad is gonna disown me in like couple of days already know it he already starting this whole process and it just coming at really bad time um and i'm struggling with like letting those experiences affect everything else that do um and like other people that interact with because know that my dad is not normal but shouldn't expect other people to be like that as well and just feel bad for treating people differently because maybe felt like saw similar trait or something um yeah just i'm sad i'm so sad i'm just like really sad and can't even cry about it yeah pretty stressful day today um lot of social tension within friend groups we added someone to our friend group that immediately backfired um in terms of information shared not staying within four walls uh so have some tension with the person that went on date on um hopefully not with this new girl who in our group because really like her like we met at [inaudible] and she just awesome you know um but yeah have been thinking lot about my dad today dealing with rejection overthinking social interactions i'm just really struggling and i'm overthinking everything so i'm just going to not say anything from now on when it comes to me and this guy and i'm just not going to think about anything at all not thing i'm just going to be the same person was which is the person he liked and we'll take it from there um schoolwork got some work done on my paper today um but realize that working on the same thing all day is not it not conducive so will be splitting up my time tomorrow with math and econ and little bit of my paper um yeah but now i'm just trying to get some shut-eye long day today reconnected with an old friend not old friend friend haven't seen in while he gave me so much insight basically i'm making the wrong decision in pursuing relationship with this guy and need to stop and need to listen to everyone because they're right and just don't wanna believe um myself right now so that happening wasn't as productive as i'd wanted to be today will not be seeing anyone tomorrow except for breakfast and um yeah basically friends aren't really my friends just one person actually um and yeah this person is not right for me and need to make sure that stick by this conclusion other important things um no not really that was basically the bulk of my day the reason got stressed today is because of him sad because of him somewhat happy because of him basically think just want relationship when i'm willing to do it with anybody which is so problematic but also know that not true i'm not willing to do it with anybody because push away people that aren't him and it just so problematic and basically just need to reevaluate my life and understand that like wanna be like pleased and like think just just like more body or i'm horny or something but don't know what to do so yeah pretty interesting day um had got some like great work done was pretty productive did lot of econ finished my paper which was great um currently yeah finished my paper went to library went to econ office hours and then um brought my friend [redacted] went to cvs visited another friend um that friend one went on date on was thoroughly disgusted by him [inaudible] and he called me coward um so that don't practice the words that say and was wondering when was gonna be done with the space of you know me monitoring myself around him i'll say my thoughts being quiet and whatnot um honestly just felt really disrespected and not because of what he said of what he called me it just that he really value his friendship and and as always cast out my definition of friendship my definition of friendship is all or nothing whatever whatever and it was fine but um my definition is uplifting and he wouldn't just call me coward if he were friend until you're being kind and here how you do it or know you can do this here what you need to do that not what he did and he came at me he doesn't let me finish he makes me feel powerless he makes me feel terrible about myself makes me feel stupid i'm in for some reason i'm still trying to like this man so this saturday would be my last date with him yeah [tertiary] 'cause this is i'm better than this i'm stronger than this and i'm not being my best self and think break is going to reveal lot of things so yeah um interesting day today was more confrontational that have been in while um but think it turned out well um got most of what wanted to say out got some closure realized some things um about my relationship with this guy um very negative not healthy relationship and i'm okay i'm okay with canceling that relationship maybe not entirely but definitely keeping it as something that remains friends because deserve to be loved and i'm smart and care about people and care about myself to continue with that today after talking to this guy after yesterday night he called me coward and so found all of the things he hates about me um we had conversation and he said something along the lines of perhaps he subconsciously trying to not like me because he holds me to different standards and he holds black women to different standards than he does of white women and he doesn't quite know what it is to be black yet and i'm not sure where hatred ties into that argument or where purposeful disgust of someone is necessary however am okay and am strong black woman and am proud of my blackness not that it uniform but that it unique and appreciate mine as much as appreciate everyone else and um think i've just grown tonight and i'm really glad that have really good friends like my friend um that reconnected with not reconnected but like just who haven't seen in while and um he was just so helpful gave me some mental support gave me advice told me to text him after with the number 501 or for any help or if i'm okay and that just like that something you want not even in relationship it doesn't have to be like that just from friend like uh this person really cares and like knows what to do you know and that just just like really really appreciated that and one of my friends left today um for good for all of winter break it doesn't quite feel real yet but she just gonna be gone for whole month and half that just crazy you know 'cause we've gotten so close to these people and i'm hoping that this break for me is time of rebirth and renewal um but i'm just really wanna do well in my exams so i'm gonna focus on that focus on myself the goodness of what deserve which is nothing less than the best um pretty good day today was able to finish my paper hand in two papers which means now just have to study for my two exams not feeling super prepared for them but did some good work around them um in terms of social interactions got to hang out with lot of my friends that really like spent minimum time with people that made friends with that don't necessarily enjoy spending time with um and avoided some confrontation today but now i'm feeling okay i'm just going to bed now i'm really tired and think just need to reclaim myself and in doing that need to cut off some relationships so yeah pretty interesting day today um made some big decision to just stay friends with person that went on one date with i'm feeling relaxed um other than that got some [inaudible] having hard time focusing felt terrible super sick um think have really bad sinus infection or don't know what but we're definitely struggling but yeah just kinda feel like there weight off my chest now i'm not sad probably will be tomorrow but you know other than that try to be productive don't know how to study i'm not feeling super prepared but [inaudible] okay day today subconsciously coping with losing friend think um got some work done did some studying saw my friend who is pretty awesome told me to believe in myself whatever he just very good friend to have and he struggling bit and wish could advise him as much as he advises me but it is what it is um other than that pretty nonchalant day um dealt with some rooming situations but that all set now so yeah today was really just low-key studying eating studying um didn't really see any of my friends today so it was interesting um today was pretty laid back just did lots of studying um printed out new practice exam to take today and did terribly on it didn't finish it um but like the multiple choice was just awful and i'm feeling lot of pressure because really need to do well um to get good grade um but just don't know what to do i'm studying i'm reviewing and like maybe i'm just not studying well but also don't know how to study then like it-it just i'm just struggling so tomorrow i'm gonna redo practice exams that did to make sure that remember what did wrong um and yeah and so like feel like know things and in theory could do them but little there little bit of confidence issue and this is for economics um that i'm struggling with but just really need to do well and i'm like praying spending all my time on it and math just really really really really really wanna do well and this has really made me extra determined to do well next semester because this is and don't like this feeling like to do well so yeah i'm just hoping things get better and feel really dumb so over winter break i'm literally going to school i'm going to read and i'm going to write i'm gonna study get ahead of my homework and know say this now but like actually can't do this like just can't so need to get ahead but yeah that really all that been on my mind pretty good day today um saw the friend that recently said would stay friends with um went pretty well had quick little phone call things are pretty normal and appreciate it lot made me feel good and then have my econ exam tomorrow excited nervous terrified um i'm not confident in anything to ever say that i'm ready for something um but i've definitely put in lot of work so hopefully it pays off but guess we shall see i'm pretty nervous but hope things will end well because need them to um but also worked really really hard and um just really need to do well so that that um yeah i've just really been studying today went to the gym to see my trainer i've been sort of slacking on self-care really need to wash my hair so that gotta happen asap but also have an exam friday so will have time tomorrow to wash my hair probably not will do it anyways well it possible um so yeah hoping yeah just really need to do well tomorrow and that all that really on my mind right now [i'm still] going to bed early wake up early hopefully my roommate is done [inaudible] go to bed um but yeah um pretty okay day today have math test tomorrow don't really know how feel feel like little um don't know if feel prepared because those tests always kind of take you by landslide but um definitely feel like put in some work more and more worried about econ as the days go on but i'm like not someone who usually worried about grades but people here talk about them lot so it just like has me thinking about them but i'm hoping that things turn out well and that can like really really just really do well next semester um some tension with my dad today definitely some issues with that sector where today he sent message saying that he no longer in the picture so that that and um yeah it not something that unexpected happens lot but it really surprising at this age he still playing these games and i'm 18 years old but other than that nothing really been on my mind other than studying and my friend today said hope you don't come back different from break and that really made me question lot of things as well in terms of like what would change what is staying the same that maybe people like but perhaps don't and what more important in that as well so just been coming across those thoughts recently but honestly i'm just ready to restart next semester 'cause just did so trash this one um pretty okay day today took my math exam not quite sure how felt about it um i'm worried there worried about my grades but really need to do well want to do well in the class and this has definitely awakened me um and really told me to do better next semester which is what must do and will do without doubt um but yeah other than that now after took my exam finished at 500 just felt pretty relaxed so played some wall ball by myself my other friend here is leaving tomorrow morning saw him for bit my friend who here till like sunday or monday um she writing paper so she very busy so didn't see her but yeah mean it pretty chill day saw some newer friends and yeah now i'm hoping to just read tomorrow having lot of roommate drama lo lot of roommate tension people not being willing to move respect way needs and wants after have sacrificed the whole semester they can't sacrifice one day but you know we're not all adults here guess which is unfortunate but the truth so i'm dealing with that that been i'd say the biggest stress other than my exams on my mind and took my friend out to dinner today um this is the guy that went on date on while ago we decided that wasn't gonna work um had really good time we just have like good comfortable relaxed time when we when it just us but also have like every person telling me that he bad for me so don't know what to do but yeah that about my life um pretty stressful day today with my roommates um i've had lot of struggle with getting my stuff moved into my single lot of people being very disrespectful very childish and that was something didn't think i'd encounter for long time or really again but was very wrong um and think that'll make me see my roommates in very different light when return um and feel like side of me came out today that never wanna see again it was just rude and not nice and confrontational to an extent that was just aggressive and didn't like that so won't be doing that again but now that the process is over and moved in i'm happy and now i'm home i'm with my cat just wanna relax and read so yeah um really relaxed day today just walked around with mom lot um saw an old friend which was really great to see we talked about our struggles in college mostly social i'm really scared of my grades and that something that hasn't changed um but i'm like really really nervous and just wanna do really well um but i'm not sure this is the best start but think [inaudible] with [inaudible] please forgive me from my my sins and please help me [inaudible] just kidding just started praying here that how scared was um but yeah i'm like really tired so that probably why just mixed that up as well um but i'm just sort of ready for bed i've been reading some really great books and feel like i've been replenishing my mind with like actual vocabulary and like things to talk about which is good um but yeah other than that it like really chill nothing happens as much um in rhode island but like also just in general compared to when i'm actually at college like there always like multiple things multiple people [seen] and like here that just not happening at all but i'm kind of okay with it for now um pretty interesting day today spent some time with my dad to pick up my stuff from my dorm um spoke to some friends on the phone uh for really long time on skype um and really happy did in light of reevaluating my friend groups uh think this friend group that just spoke with really stimulates my mind in very different way than my other friends whereas it mostly playful with them and and you know just like cheery laughing being goofy as with these friends can actually have an intellectual discussion and and really really appreciate that and value that and it makes me feel great and it also inspires me to like be the people that we talk about later on like when we see somebody who gonna be really successful like wanna be the person that you think about and like that what we were just talking about and then people on campus and that really strike us as somebody who gonna be something and really wanna be that person um so yeah that just how i'm feeling right now i'm feeling really good about those relationships that i've solidified um pretty okay day today spent most of my time by myself um woke up pretty early [inaudible] look over the full list [inaudible] i'm just really tired put on some frasier so can go to bed um just went to work out and got my nails done was really by myself and and liked it was relaxed am stressed about my grades don't know if they're gonna be good or bad i'm really nervous about them um but also um am worried about this extracurricular that i'm applying for on top of the many others that have too so that but i'm okay like know wanna do that but yeah um pretty okay day um sent in an application got asked to interview um was mostly by myself today um when did see my mom we were fine spoke to my dad he upset with me saying that pushed him away while was in college and that basically i've lost him and that things won't be the same which is interesting um and think unfair but not new news from him um so yeah i'm just struggling with that guess was fine until this happened which was very recently like maybe 10-15 minutes ago so yeah um other than that nothing really happened today just sat by myself lot did work that it um pretty good day today hung out with my friend from high school or really from elementary school which was awesome and definitely spoke about like life decisions i'm making and things and to cut myself some slack but also make change take things easy [inaudible] and she helped me with my social relationship in terms of this guy um yeah she was really helpful and i'm glad spoke to her we just kinda chilled um but yeah i'm hoping to see my other friends even had some conversations with my dad and that didn't go well as usual he saying that should look for support from my friends and not him because things aren't the same anymore so yeah don't even know what to think of that um but that pretty normal for our relationship where he just likes to drop 'cause of things that don't really have control over like my voice probably but you know it is what it is um i'm hurt by it really miss my friends from college and one of them you know speak to them about every day he pretty great but still miss him 'cause don't really like to see him which is interesting and i'm figuring out that really really do like him so we'll see what happens pretty relaxed day today um spent most of my time with my mom uh went to dinner with her we didn't have lunch but had late breakfast so it fine uh had some discussions about her relationship with my dad christmas and you know whether he gonna be there or not um spoke to my friend today one on facetime and another on the phone as usual spoke to him every day [inaudible] um he mentioned something he saw his ex-girlfriend um and she was basically like she still loves him or whatever and like don't know if he doesn't like her anymore 'cause know he kept saying like he not depressed he over it like the whole like situation but then later on when asked him another question um and we were comparing his relationship his old relationship to our friends he was like she perfect there you know they weren't things to talk about nobody could tell me about her blah blah blah and was just like really heard that and was like hmm are they really done where am in this equation where should be in this equation [inaudible] about that little bit but definitely do like him um but not as friend and yeah we just uh just need to see where things go so this break is just really interesting [inaudible] we'll see today was okay um woke up worked out and then was with my mom all day and we just went christmas shopping for my dad we drove all the way up to boston then when we called him and made him answer it was sort of like the icing on the cake for him sort of not treating us very nicely um so then we left like as soon as we got there we parked we sat for five minutes and then we left and we went back home then we went shopping for him here and um had another fit over that ended up buying things he got mad at me said he was done with me this is my dad um yeah and he was basically saying i'm distant didn't treat him the same in school blah-blah-blah same thing essentially think he just doesn't like me but at this point don't really like care but know nothing gonna change and so like that was that but um yeah then we went home and ate then spoke to my friend uh who sick in hopes that he feels better we also spoke about um [tanni hificous] and cornel west and that whole debacle and then spoke to my friend on facetime 'cause she going to ghana for the next five weeks so i'll miss her lot and yeah then did some work and i'm going to bed pretty late now but yeah that my day pretty good day today um got some great closure um met with my mom family today which we haven't done in really long time um and it was great saw my uncle who haven't seen lot um recently and also in my life he been in and out of jail um we sort of just like see him around or like by surprise so it was nice seeing him today and um he sort of apologized for everything and you know shared that he wanted to be part of my life and that things were just not working for him and that he was really struggling um and him not being there entirely wasn't wasn't enough for him um but he really proud of me and lot of my family um just said how much they were proud of me um for going to harvard and they said you know they always knew was smart and found myself questioning again what those characteristics or those qualities are um but if everyone else saw it i'm wondering why can't see it um the same time it also reminded me what i'm doing at harvard why i'm doing what i'm doing who i'm doing it for i'm doing it for my family i'm doing it for people like my family and it was just really really great experience we were there for good five hours um we also saw my mom other friend um which was really nice we had lunch with her had some good conversations um yeah she asked me about school as well um by coincidence right before we saw her saw her ex-husband walking with one of her kids um and didn't wanna say hi um just because he almost killed her um he almost killed his ex-wife which was who we met with for lunch and just didn't feel comfortable so just let them walk by and told my mom and she just let them walk by as well um so that was really interesting but think today was really good day and met with the side of my family that don't usually see but am very grateful that did um not terrible day today um spent the morning with my mom opened some gifts it very relaxed day today uh my dad and my cousin came down eventually we went to dinner um and hung out there for bit spent some good time with my cousin things were really awkward and tense with my dad um but spoke to him maybe ten fifteen minutes ago and things seem to be okay now um i've decided to be the bigger person here and just uh recognize well over yesterday and today i'm starting to recognize what mean to other people and that not saying that i'm like this like amazing person or whatever but that like i'm people kid and people have known me from when was young and they're seeing me grow and i'm important to them as they're important to me and so when become distant which is by no means on purpose or when they feel like i'm leaving them they're dealing with the loss that that very serious and very heavy and hadn't really taken that into account and which am now and i'm doing that um after giving someone else the same exact advice which is interesting how your own advice comes back to you buy yeah so that what i've just been dealing with i'm just ready to crack down on school and do really well think this next semester although i've been like thinking lot about boys and things um don't wanna deal with it wanna have friends yeah but i'm not old enough and i'm not ready to be in relationship as much as wanna be um and so need to recognize that and find myself first so that what i'll be doing pretty good day today um worked out um hang out with my mom all day went to the mall and shopping went to my mom friend house and then came home the day kind of started late so kind of felt [inaudible] that we didn't do much but had good time with her things went well um yeah working on the relationship with my dad um just read something by bell hooks about feminism um it really helping me sort of come up with these conversations on my own and and come up with comebacks and sort of broadening my vocabularies and it giving me the language to discuss these things and these issues of feminist theory um and i'm just really excited to come back to school and like just show people that know what i'm talking about show people that i'm actually smart because think lot of people at school think i'm actually stupid which am only to certain extent um so i'm hoping to be smarter at this upcoming semester and seem smarter as well pretty good day today um lots of time with my mom got my hair done um and then spent some times with my friends from high school which is awesome um and after that went to my mom friend house who has daughter that i'm pretty close with it was her 18th birthday um had some cake for her but also uh the night mostly consisted of having conversation um with her her boyfriend um about some tension that they're having he in college she in high school um there lot of tension there with like time talking to other people um the daughter also hit her boyfriend um which is really big deal and apparently she done it more than once um and this is important obviously because you should never put your hands on other people um but her father was abusive to her mother and almost killed her in fact so the fact that this has spread downwards um is very interesting um and so they sort of looked at my mom and as like third party to get advice on like the situation how to go about it not necessarily who is right or wrong but like just in reason and perspective on the situation and that was really interesting but today was pretty good day also spoke to my um two friends over facetime which was fun um and texted another person about um some issues they're having with um sexuality in terms of just being horny essentially um but yeah she got through that and helped her with that which was awesome pretty good day today um had an interview uh which went pretty well think um and really got me in the mood of like getting excited about academics again it was something that just felt really good after and was like wow wanna do great things wanna be doing something important um so that sort of revived something that haven't really felt in while and really appreciated that um spent some time with my dad today and my mom all three of us we went to dinner um we took the train up there and the train back um it was pretty good and yeah it was like pretty chill day but that about most of what happened hmm yeah just read as well um and i'm just putting on some modern family tv before go to bed i'll just totally go to sleep 'cause i've been having trouble sleeping but yeah i'm just sort of like tossing and turning in bed so don't really know when i'm awake and like i'm gonna get up or not which

frustrated at one point but um things are okay now um pretty relaxing um feeling like i'm ready to do some school work to get prepared for the upcoming semester and just wanna do really well um and so that all i'm really focusing on and also wanna stay really positive and wanna stay in this groove of loving to learn 'cause think forgot about that this last semester and so yeah i'm just really excited um for the future and i'm hoping things go well so need to do well now and that that what i'm pushing towards that what i'm using as my guiding force um spoke bit about religion today with my cousin who is jehovah witness i'm not quite sure what am at this point um but yeah just had really good talk so that something that need to think about bit more um but as of right now i'm just focusing on school god and myself pretty good day today um hung out with my mom and dad and spoke to my friend on the phone for quite some time um made some friendship or try to make friendship

like you know are they good for me do they make me happy do they inspire me do they push me to you know try harder and do better or do they make me complacent and laziness um and being okay with failure and so those are some things that really have to think about but other than that um that really consisted of most of my day finished the application today really just sat down and did it and feel pretty good about it but i'm excited really wanna do something this summer um my dad answered my call today which was good guess i'm really over fighting for relationship with him but um guess he is [inaudible] wants me to really fight for him and chase him and i'm starting to see um what people say about when they get tired of chasing people eventually they're gonna stop chasing i've always wanted the chase want someone to chase me to want me but that exhausting on someone else part so don't want that anymore but um guess will try to build good relationship with my father see what happens pretty great day today um went to my school and uh went to basketball game at my school um and saw some of the students there they were really excited to see me um was reminded of how much of an impact had on [redacted] when students who hadn't known um nor gone to school with came up to me and said things like are you the [redacted] or are you the [redacted] legend people talk about blah blah blah and it made me feel great and at the same time it reminded me of the pressure that have to do well and to be something um and i'm glad was re-exposed to that because felt like was missing my drive and my purpose and i've rediscovered it um and i'm looking to go back to school during the actual school day so can um see um more people and talk to them and reconnect um and was just really happy to be there also spent some time with my other friend um who went to high school with we just sort of chilled and that was fun as well um so yeah then spoke to two guy friends on the phone i'm feeling like one is starting to sort of like me maybe not in just friend way and don't reciprocate those feelings but more than happy to be great friend um pretty boring day today stayed home all day worked on this application for the summer um [pro] stuff didn't like it we wrote things didn't like it um part of it was me sitting in front of the tv with my mom um she watches the tv while she works and didn't move into my own room um just to like you know not to isolate myself from her all day um so did that eventually went into my room today got it done now i'm just waiting for reports on um my [tf's] um but i'm yeah feeling good so like this goldman sachs thinking maybe he should visit my school tomorrow definitely have to work out because didn't move today at all um yeah that was about it didn't eat too much today had good three meals which is good but of course had three meals on the day that didn't move around at all and i've been having two meals day unintentionally so i'm going to figure this out but yeah that about it pretty good day today um woke up late um had some trouble sleeping last night but got up um chilled bit didn't really do any work today um but did go to the gym um had some good conversations with my mom friend um decided that should and that will get counselor or therapist don't really know the right terminology um because think i'd need that right now and know there nothing wrong with that just usually fear the first meeting um because always cry lot but think it absolutely necessary also feeling some health issues um had really sore throat for maybe three days now it just really hurts to swallow um but other than that i'm really happy got that um application done yesterday i'm getting more and more excited about it um and i'm just very grateful for the connections that i've made um though they may be small they're incredibly important um and i'm kind of happy so i'm going to read book called girl boss um and just wanna come into next semester confident ready um and just to really show my true self and i'm not sure if showed that this semester think got lost on what wanted to be in order to blend in um but that wasn't quite uh what should have done so dn i'm just so so excited to go back and the day is getting closer and closer and i'm really happy about that pretty okay day today um it started okay got progressively worse woke up at 800 um which is so early for me have done that in while it was so early that felt nauseous um and i'd like to get back to my old schedule um went to the mall with my mom met with her friend and her friend daughter for lunch then went to cambridge to meet with some of my former students have mini reunion thing um and on my way home started to get these text messages from my dad uh they were pretty horrendous telling me to change my name um he doesn't love me anymore things will never be the same delete his number um he doesn't care about me he not paying for school stuff like that and so was fine um like and he spoke to my mom guess my mom like cried and stuff and and this is stuff that used to happen earlier in life um so i've kinda gotten used to it where it doesn't really affect me but also know that don't really feel emotions immediately um so was fine hearing her talk about it in the car she got bit emotional [hearing her] talk about it on the phone and then said just really need to take shower need to put on some music need to just understand what going on and just wash this all off of me so took shower um and heard one song and it said love is free and started to cry because if love is free then why do owe people for it um and so that was something that really really um touched me and that broke me just for bit but it was very short 10 15 seconds and then was fine got out the shower did my own thing and then sat and watched the ending to movie with my mom um she fell asleep on the couch but yeah um so guess you could say watched tv just to not focus on anything wrote um after my shower because really wanna write book that i'm gonna put the words that wrote into google document to really get my book started um and just really haven't felt these emotions in while and this is pressure for me to do well in school 'cause now really really have to so yeah pretty okay day today um started terribly with my dad arguing and saying some very not nice things um and then just had to just go over there figure out what going on as soon as got there he was fine so i'm glad got some closure with my dad um had good conversation with my mom mostly about everything that i've been doing wrong about how need to leave that in the past and really move forward and and also be very proactive with my life and do things on my own um guess i'm not child anymore and need to take charge need to care about myself um on top of that uh my dad and went out to eat woke up this morning went to bed at like 11-something and still woke up at 1100 oh was up for while and then went back to bed um so yeah still having trouble sleeping but um scheduled my flu shot which is not my physical and realize can't schedule my physical 'cause don't have physician um also try to schedule counseling but need to figure that out with timing myself um but yeah i'm just like getting on top of things slowly but surely yeah pretty okay day today pretty calm stayed inside the house um did an application it felt great it was really exciting um i'm ready to just do incredibly well in the future spoke to my friend [inaudible] spoke to in couple of days and it was awesome spoke to another friend um who wants to include me on project that he starting i'm just really excited things are gonna go really well this semester i'm just ready to jump in have to wake up early tomorrow which is terrible but it will be happening today was really just me by myself and like that like to be alone pretty great day today um hung out with some of my high-school friends felt awesome um you know they remind me of the self that used to be that liked lot more and i'm just feeling lot more driven at home um so i'm ready to bring this all back to harvard and do really well and i'm really looking to branch out from the friend group that had made because although it is safe space um think i've clung too much to it and really need to branch out and make more friends that are more driven and ready to do greater things um so i'm ready for that and i'm just so excited also spoke to some of my other friends one of my friends who goes to brown um spoke to me bit about just how stressed she was for next semester and how well she did this semester and we relate on on different level just because lot of our friends because of our high school think um our college preparatory school um they find what they're doing is easy um and us maybe it because they're ivy leagues or just the type of schools that we're going to we're definitely struggling bit more in that these classes are really hard and there not lot of support um academic support should say um but we're working hard and we're getting grades that we're not used to getting and that something new um for both of us in terms of yes the number um but also what that means um in high school you know you see that it low and you get it up quickly rapidly in in college you get the grade once and that it and it final absolutely um and that kind of scary because everything means lot um and you don't know your teachers and you can't quite connect with them and and and maybe you know shimmy your grade up bit not that we did that but things were lot closer before um in terms of relationships um with peers with teachers deans of students and things like that so um that just something that we were talking about and said you know make sure you don't lock yourself in your room next semester and she said um no like think might have to and said you know part of this is yes we have to do well in school like we have to get good grades um but because of the schools that we're going to our endeavors are little bit different in that grades are not the only things that matter and we have to network and put as much effort into networking as we do in making sure that our grades are good um because at the end of the day numbers can get you places but knowing people gets you farther um so we just spoke about that bit and um yeah and that was really awesome and then spoke to my other friend about making um sort of like little company sort of thing that planning it like an album guess to represent the diversity at harvard but we're planning to make those donations to uh some foundations so was invited to work on that meeting so could do developer i'm excited but that also sort of awakened um my sense of urgency in terms of making more friends making better friends making friends that inspire me and help me do well and but yeah so it been really great day think pretty awesome day today um so last night we drove to washington dc my mom dad and um to come to your program through the iop and the uh um office of career services um to visit cnn and npr um so that why didn't get to do my audio survey last night 'cause wasn't alone and couldn't get alone 'cause we were stuck in car um but had great day today um went to this program with about 13 or 12 other students and sat at cnn and npr was so exhausting didn't get lot of sleep in the car um and some things were really interesting and it was really amazing to see the different um environments and and cultures of both of these organizations that really sort of aim to do the same thing through different means um which is journalism and and sharing information um also hung out with some really cool kids that were so different from me but we had great conversations over sushi and we just hung out and chilled and it was really amazing um which is completely awesome and uh yeah so now i'm going to bed 'cause have to wake up really early um to make 730 train um but yeah i'm really happy with today and don't know how feel about my career i'm not sure wanna career in journalism but politics yes but i'm really glad came um yeah feel like made good decision today um pretty relaxed day today was on bus for eight hours then train for another hour and half um so that was really the whole day but my parents were happy to see me which was great so was my kitty um and we got some food and today felt today felt really well was really grateful to have the opportunity to reflect on yesterday and also get started on my book um and just figuring out what stories wanna include and as started writing realized that i'm not really an exceptional writer um but hope to become that and hope that my stories um could make me [inaudible] important messages so that exciting um was also contacted by my friend um he says we need to chop usually what that means is to have conversations that not serious but just li well serious yes but in terms of like our future advice sort of thing so um i'm glad he can look to me um for that because often feel like i'm just taking and not giving from to him which is unfortunate but i'm working on it and working on confidence and and loving myself and understanding that am enough so um i'm working on that perspective on our friendship um but other than that yeah really just sat on bus and then train but it was nice it was really nice to have time to reflect pretty good day today um didn't feel very well feeling sort of nauseous and carsick all the time probably still recovering from the car ride um got some work done spoke with my friend about courses and getting closer with this friend in good way um this is guy friend that i've been friends with for while and talking on the phone lot or just um yeah um and had some good conversations with my mom today i'm feeling ready for school basically have my classes picked out um and i'm just so excited to start and i'm moving in tomorrow [inaudible] interview um on monday two interviews hopefully on monday and then from there um let see yeah then i'll be at an assertive program on tuesday so i'm just really getting into things um haven't started reading my econ book which was something that wanted to do but did read other books and and sort of got some of that stuff done in terms of broadening my vocabulary and preparing myself to have discussions about important political topics listening to things and yeah and getting some good rest so i'm really excited to go back um pretty great day today um moved in so am back at school back at [redacted] um really excited um have an interview tomorrow potentially another one um as well tomorrow if not tuesday um but i'm hoping to get some work done spoke to my friends over skype um some of my friends are here which is great um we spoke about social relationships and blocking and how that already bringing up some tension um so that was interesting to take look at uh let see yeah just like it pretty difficult because now you know i've created this friend group that like i'm not sure if like the self that am within that friend group um but definitely there is group feel comfortable with would want to block with them i'm not quite sure and so that has me little bit nervous um so yeah feel like i'm getting more comfortable with the other set of friends that i've made um and like my [redacted] and think they're helping me and they're elevating me instead of you know taking me down um so that just something that on my mind but right now i'm just getting sleep get ready for my interview tomorrow and just really being prepared to do well and really succeed and have my single so moved in i'm feeling pretty set and i'm feeling very determined to just get great grades do well here academically and socially and just really get everything together pretty great day today had two interviews um the first one um got the job um she offered it to me right there said i'd get back to her um and then my uh second interview think went well she was little bit tough um but think it went pretty well um so that something that have to grapple with in terms of um both of these opportunities are extremely important and will really help me in my future um with the experience that they'd be able to give me however if were to do something wanna do it well um and so definitely have to take into account you know what i'm able to do and remind myself that missed it at first so that something that i've been stressed with in that wanna do so incredibly well here um and really wanna be like that girl that doing amazing and and is amazing and has amazing things or maybe not has amazing things but is an amazing person and is doing amazing things um so it just hard to balance everything and sort of make that decision for yourself um but felt little proud of myself today which was good um and have to keep moving forward with that and then did see my parents today that was good i'm definitely trying to stay more connected with them as i'm at school just to get help from them with keeping me on track and things um yeah getting much more organized using an agenda um hoping to get started on homework tomorrow um to get ahead of schedule and set up meeting at the bureau of study counsel to get things cracking so i'm excited very very excited pretty relaxed day today um didn't eat very healthily which wasn't good um something wanted to uh work on as got back but i'm staying on track working out in the morning tomorrow waking up early getting some work done starting my school work tomorrow and then yeah still little stressed about classes in terms of which ones to take um but yeah also saw some friends today and hung out with them for bit that was fun um those friends they're just two people who are in relationship so kind of felt like third-wheeling but it okay um started my program today on opportunities in education super super excited think it gonna be awesome and i'm really happy um that decided to jump in have an interview tomorrow that i'm bit nervous for it for the summer really hope get it 'cause that would be absolutely amazing um but yeah just sort of ready to tackle everything and um today told um one person that didn't want the job that they offered me and they were sort of just like well let me know when you know your schedule so we can work something out which means that they want me um which is awesome that good feeling um but need to make sure that can do it and then be student first and do well here um so i'm really stressed about that but yeah no that about it just pretty chill day watched some comedy stuff but i'm ready for bed now pretty good day today um woke up early and went to the gym um did laundry and did some econ homework during then uh and then went to my program came back finished laundry um went to dinner saw some people that hadn't seen which was really exciting um and then went to my room spoke on the phone to my friend and asked him about some struggles i'm having with extracurriculars and committing myself to certain ones that um really require lot of work um that was really incredible experience um and that had little bit of time to prep for an interview then did the interview and it was really exciting something that really love to do um you know as sat through the interview more realized how much really wanted those um and you know maybe leaving technology behind isn't the best um idea but do want to enjoy my life and enjoy my life so wanna do something that love and don't know if cs will bring me there um but i'm hoping to do something incredible to be something incredible so right now i'm just sort of applying to everything and that why i've had so many interviews think um but i'm hoping things go well and it not like i'm stressed about extracurriculars quite yet but know wanna do something great and that that puts pressure on it right now um but wouldn't equate that to stress um but yeah so today i'd say was mostly relaxed just lot of subconscious thinking about um the future which is why called my friend and asked him to give me some insight and his perspective on the issue pretty good day today um not as productive as i'd hoped to be in terms of doing econ work but i'm really tired now but did do lot of my program today i'm pretty happy with it and um got contacted by um one of the places interviewed for made it to the final round so that exciting um and just spoke to my parents saw my mom and dad saw my dad today actually um yeah just know school coming it like right around the corner literally um and hope can stay on my own track and that gonna be really big for me and think can do it i've just really gotta focus um on my my end goal not my now need to be thinking ahead but i'm so excited and i'm really excited to see my friends um little nervous about housing um don't think want to live with the friends that i've made um so that bit of struggle but i'm excited [inaudible] just really wanna sleep pretty good day today um woke up in the morning went to my program that early to go to our last um site visit which is really really great um and then from there came back home after long bus ride um did some preparation for the semester which starts monday um put important dates on my calendar um set up all of my binders and things um so i'm really excited nervous ready to do exceptionally well um yeah today felt pretty relaxed i'd say was pretty happy spent lot of time with this one girl who lives in [redacted] uh and she white um which is not good or bad thing like in the normal context but because most of the friends i've made are are black um i'm happy that was able to um build relationship um with someone who doesn't look like me because that what i'm used to on that home um so that was not exciting but um important and then uh after dinner with my dad then went to [redacted] basement and made some posters with some girls um which was also fantastic so yeah today was like pretty good day really liked it actually really great day today got to see all of my friends um which was fantastic um got to get some really good quality time in with my friend um that spoke to over the phone lot almost every day over the break and uh just really connected with we were able to just you know vibe sit there listen to music talk he was talking to me about his ideas for the crimson um which is newspaper and just like we were just chilling which was good um saw some other friends had little bit of not tension but did feel little bit uneasy um at some points just you know and some comments about like them not seeing me over the semester and me being dedicated to my work essentially were just like um overly curious of other friendships that have um and little bit critical so that was that um then had another friend come over and um he basically just said like can come over and bother you for sec and was like sure you know i'm i'm usually always open for emotional support um when people need it just you know to help them out because know what it feels like to not have any outlet for that um so it went well he came over he just sort of talks about this existential crisis he having with being in liminal space yet he he wouldn't explain in between like where the threshold lied guess and the states that he was jumping in between and with him it was sort of tricky because couple of people have told me that he interested in me in as more than friend but don't think he is um so was wondering if he was trying to get something like that off of his chest and just wasn't able to do it um but yeah so was just dealing with that but yeah that about it don't really know what to think of that situation i'm not interested in him like that um but i'm always willing to be friends and to be good friend to anyone who needs it so that what am just going by but yeah pretty good day today um went to brunch with my friends saw lot of them connected with them saw some great people that hadn't seen in while which was fantastic um it reminded myself of all the relationships i'd like to have and and strengthen um did some homework today which was great it was not due but um i'd like to get ahead um on top of that um just had some good conversations with my friends met with my [path] um and she helped me you know she shed some light on um my workload and and what that gonna look like and if working is good idea um and yeah just like little bit stressed about couple of my relationships with my friends that kind of felt different today but that may just be um me overthinking things as usual um but i'm definitely starting to get little stressed um feeling those chest pains again but watch to make sure that do very well this semester and that i'm happy so will be actively um trying to ensure that these relationships don't have such great impact on my school work or how carry myself and um how just make decisions um so i'm just i'm excited for this semester really really want to do well which is huge um and know how important it is so i'm i'm really ready to dive in i'm gonna hope things turn out well pretty okay day today had my first classes um like them had conversation with my friend today about like concentration what we wanna be and stuff and left feeling really stressed um knowing that have no idea what wanna do what wanna concentrate in and i'm constantly going towards this thing of trying to fulfill my parent ideal uh me and have job that secures financial independence um but not quite so much fulfillment and really need to change that mindset um but also need to get my life together because there nobody that gonna tell me to do it and there not gonna be moment where i'm like oh guess should do this now like it needs to happen and need to be proactive about it so um that what i'm hoping to do guess but yeah just realized like i'm feeling behind which hate that feeling then spent some time with my usual group of girlfriends um and that was good feel better about the situation in housing and was little bit distracted with them but you know keep it in in short sprints we'll be all right today was not good day um like nothing bad happened but um as the day went on felt worse and worse about myself um and sort of not knowing what wanna do feeling unprepared um not of caliber um compared to my other classmates and um just in general even if were at regular school um and that makes me sad um it very different from my [inaudible] it sounds terrible but like used to like overachieving or like being that girl um and don't know how to do that here and so that something that has been sort of eating away at me um and so today met with um bureau of study counselor um also met with my advisor and just really realized like don't wanna do computer science whatsoever at all and i'm only doing it because think should be and then realized that i've been doing that my whole life and that i've been untrue to myself and now am feeling the repercussions of that decision um and they're not great and actually feel terrible 'cause i'm behind um don't know what to do with myself i'm not well versed in what i'm interested in because barely know what i'm interested in um and essentially just feel like am child um and i'm immature because always needed structure and didn't quite do things on my own guess you could say when it came to what wanted to do and what felt was my mission or my in-internal compass um and so that was really bothering me and told my dad about it and we walked around and talked about it and had some grub um but yeah so that really how my day went and it just sort of been like weighing down on my shoulders um and it probably will for couple of days probably won't see anyone like that many people for couple of days or just interact as much um do like having single gives me the space to just be here and um wallow really um and hope that that space you know instead of having negative impact on me and allowing me to dwell on my emotions and and self-pity um it'll give me time to reflect and focus and and grow in terms of creating mental space um for discovering who am and what wanna do and unfortunately don't think can rush finding my mission but don't have time and don't want more time yeah i'm just hoping that i'm enough for people for myself for our future um and i'm starting to feel like i'm unlovable as well don't really know where that came from but that definitely happening so yeah pretty good day today um actually no that lie it was an okay day today um went to um cans today which is mental health services um and had my first meeting um i'm not quite sure how feel about it think um therapy is very interesting because you don't come out of one or two meetings and just have all the solutions to your problems um lot of it is really just getting it out of your system and speaking it into existence so you can actively work against it um so um that was tricky for me just in like spilling lot of information it emotionally exhausting um and it makes you think about these things and usually when have to do that get little down for the rest of the day um and it not intentionally i'm not quite sure why but it definitely does happen and it definitely did today um um but i'm okay and uh one of my friends really picked up on it um when he saw me um and said had to go um was sad was going to huhs and he was like why are you going again um and guess yesterday said have to go to huhs like i'm bored or something um which didn't know said but um yeah so he sort of caught on that i've been going lot and he told me to tell him what wrong and eventually told him that was going to get counseling um and he said why didn't you tell me and said that didn't wanna put that baggage on him 'cause it wasn't fair to him um he didn't really like that argument or understand it but um think one day he will and that okay um right now and then also hung out with another friend today who don't usually hang out with absolutely loved it it was so fun um we got lunch just chilled um wish we could be in more group settings together um which think we will soon and i'm just really happy got to spend some time with her um yeah didn't see my usual group of girlfriends today though but that okay pretty um okay day still feeling little bit down um spoke to my friend again today um and he just told me that need to not put stress on myself as usual um and um that in doing this i'm [inaudible] me and very inside of myself and it not good um and it not on purpose and it so against what usually do um so it was interesting to hear and something i've been thinking about little bit i'm not mad at him for the comment and don't know if should be but am thinking about it lot and then i'm just hoping could just like really recuperate and get better 'cause it like feel like my brain is sick think it like down and every time i'm in this room in this bed or like someone brings out that they love their classes or they love what they're doing it like bullet and it like really really bothering me because i'm not feeling the same way and all i'm trying to do is feel happy all wanted to do in getting here is be happy and i'm not achieving that and constantly negotiating with what want um and that is not what should be doing but know i'm gonna do it anyways and yeah guess just wish could be as put together um as i'd like to be and know lot of this is like imposter syndrome where people feeling like everybody else is doing well but then and to some extent sure that isn't the case people put up facades obviously safety reasons however part of it is true and know i'm behind in what i'm doing i'm gonna hate myself for that but can't go back in time and can't change the way came up and how deal with emotions unfortunately um so i'm just sort of giving myself couple days to really um just sort of be in myself and really hear everything that i'm telling the little girl in my heart um what was done wrong and what you can change and what you wish you had and it not healthy to do that but think if don't do it then um it'll just keep sitting there and keep growing but really really wanna just like get better and wanna be done with this feeling um so i'm trying to actively you know find what do like um and move forward with that but it is so hard um because just wanna be happy so yeah um today was pretty good felt okay was happy with my classes and things um felt fine fem felt positive um and another day [where i've got] later and felt little more sad and um was by myself then hung out with guy friend of mine and i'm not sure if there correlation with me feeling sad being after he leaves or just that it happens to be at late hours um but that thing that been happening and now might have to call my other friend who is not upset with me but just um unhappy with um me in terms of staying in touch with him and responding to his phone calls and and text messages um in comparison to the other friend and yeah so that something that have to deal with and have to take accountability for and and it not something that i've done on purpose but um i'm just like don't really know what going on with me i'm just like sad and just lied on my floor for while and didn't sleep didn't cry just like sat there numb hearing my brain so decided to write wrote terrible poem um but nevertheless it poem and i'm not sure if it helping me or not but it kind of felt good it almost distracted me so think i'm gonna try to keep doing that um but yeah [inaudible] do that so well pretty good um day today not terrible got some work done finished one of my applications went to party danced with couple of people had some interesting interactions um the last interaction with the person that usually am interacting at dances and maybe that was for the better um and was of course sort of like jealous when he danced with other people which isn't good 'cause we're not in relationship we're just friends but it was like don't know but uh now yeah i'm sort of ready to go to bed knowing that have other interests that can pursue um and got into class today that i'm really excited for so i'm gonna do that the class wasn't math and had thought um it gonna be really hard to tell my mom about that because thought she was really for me concentrating on economics and getting job but she seems to not care at all and she didn't understand how concentrating on economics would get me job anyways so it just like really liberating um which is awesome so now i'm taking more classes that like and i'm just really happy about it but yeah um pretty okay day today went to church this morning it was like sudden impulse it was like 1023 or something and the thing started at 1100 and was like i'm ready i'm ready to be awakened so got up and got dressed as fast as can and ran uh no walked really fast let me not lie walked to the train and saw friend there got to church really liked the church i'm gonna go back i've been sort of questioning religion lot um because my parents were of two different faiths um but really felt happy sitting there and inspired and felt like was learning which was really good um and so that happened then saw my friend um same guy friend that usually see after at brunch um and asked him couple of questions about the party last night which was fine and then um when told him that went to church he wasn't mad he was like playful mad um and was just like why wouldn't you tell me um like would have like gotten up and and gone with you or like this is everything that talk about with you and so when you go you don't tell me um and really felt terrible about that um because it true and like most of the reason that did start was really him because he really embodied religion or christianity felt and wanted to be in that same light um and didn't really think about it because was so impulsive this morning but i'm very bad best friend i'm very bad best friend um just sort of felt really uh yucky about it um and tried to talk to him about it there like what happened at church and stuff and he was like yeah that good but like realize don't know when to tell people things and when to not tell people things um but i'll probably send him message tonight just to say thank you for everything um but yeah and then hung out with him some more went to the bookstore with him to get his books for classes and he said this couple times he said do you ever love someone so much you hate them and like we were like kinda like play fighting the whole time like pushing and and shoving and like saying hate you and was like yeah and we just like had like little moment which is interesting and then we went to his room and did some work then went to meeting for sorority that not sorority anymore um and that was really nice just like talking it was like final round so it was kinda weird 'cause they're kinda testing you but also just having conversation with you which is really weird but um yeah and then went and did homework started it way too late have so much reading uh and won't be able to finish it tonight but i'm gonna try my very best and yeah 'cause need to wake up early as well basically don't know how to say no to my friends still but we're working on it but yeah um i've just been really busy today just reading getting ahead not even getting ahead catching up on work um probably getting sick from staying up late too often but um yeah everything was fine and then came went to lacrosse which was fun nerve-wracking but good experience um and then uh sort of came home to lot of drama that had been going on in the background about me um and somebody who expressed that they liked me um friend that expressed that he liked me um and had feelings that did not have and that was really frustrating to see um because one was talking about it to my best friends and my best friends didn't say anything to me um and it was because they were like protecting him and like abiding by his wishes which guess shows me how good of friend that they are um but was just sort of like torn you know and um need to figure out how to balance different friend groups better um but also need to learn how to respond to text messages and that problem that have that is continuous um and really need to get on it because it starting to cause issues and don't wanna lose the friends that have and i'm seeing like they already don't have respect for me after this incident so i'm just really stressed now wasn't was just stressed about school and catching up and now i'm like really frustrated not frustrated disappointed um pretty good day today was able to be pretty productive um had little bit of an incident with my friend um and things are okay didn't see my normal group um but had really interesting class today that i'm really excited for think it'll challenge me um and i'm excited to learn also got into social club today which was very exciting um and that sort of celebration um was exciting and um knew exactly who wanted to tell as soon as it happened which was awesome and yeah it was just like good guess um met counselor today spoke about lot about my issues um yeah don't really know when i'm gonna tell my friends um sort of what going on and if they're willing to help what they could help me with but that gotta happen pretty soon but other than that today was pretty good was pretty distraught after the meeting as usually am but um i'm okay now just really really have to go to bed pretty great day today would say um got accepted to [redacted] formerly [redacted] um now [redacted] has [redacted] because of sanctions i'm so happy um was really nervous and there was point in the day where really wasn't sure if it was something that wanted um but went to the events and um just realized that like these are normal girls like normal kids and like friends that wanna make and perhaps some experiences that wanna have um they were talking about lot of like things about sex and drinking and they were drinking and it like i've never done that and i've never really had the urge and was able to say no but do think it something that sort of have to do or might i'm not quite sure yet but yeah there is that had paper due at 1200 today it was like three-page response nothing serious but um handed it in at 500 yep and that was rough but yeah did all the reading for it feeling behind schedule so exhausted only got like four hours of sleep last night so we're struggling but yeah i'm just so ready to go to bed pretty all right day today really tired just wanted to do work um met my friend went over the set with me and that ended up turning into another conversation yet again about our relationship as friends and him having feelings for me and not wanting that to change things and blah blah blah and really i'm just trying to be really productive and find it really difficult to do so here mainly 'cause i'm always surrounded by friends and occasionally it bit frustrating because wanna do really well but at the same know can't quite be successful here in locking myself in my room and that do like when can look back at the day and say yes got work done and i've been productive when i'm not sure i've been able to do that as much as would like to um other than that i've been trying to take shower for the past day and half and haven't and feel disgusting um and yeah i'm just like also craving men right now but i'm also on my period so that that um yeah i'm just like really tired i'm tired i'm going to bed late i'm tired of going to bed feeling like should have done more and i'm just like really over it so yeah pretty great day today um was really busy didn't get to do lot of work um but did lot of stuff for my sorority thing that not sorority but is sorority um which was good help me make more friends which is important um also um got lot of emails for interviews also got into program at the iop um so i'm really excited about that um feel like i'll be doing things on campus this semester i'm also doing the crimson which i'm so excited for um and i'm just like i'm really happy um and hope that things go well um but yeah i'm just living breathing should have gone to bed like an hour ago but you know doing emails the work never ends but am struggling with making sure i'm doing homework because know [really] need to before fall behind in my classes but yeah um today started pretty well was busy um running back and forth between conferences and interviews um asked group of my friends to go get berryline tonight which was like ice cream or whatever um and that ended up hurting me lot more than it was helping me thought that it would help me um instead realized that some tension with my friends has sort of culminated into something larger that perhaps they're not recognizing but could definitely feel um and felt like an outsider in group that had called my family um for the past three-plus months um so that was would say intimidating um for sure because had lot of faith um in not only my friends but the process of making friends here um and thought these ones were here to stay and perhaps was wrong perhaps i'm overreacting can't rea quite give an answer at this moment however um do feel like i'm sort of experiencing loss already and think was expecting it to happen um after this person sort of came into our friendship group our friend group and messed things up with expressing interest and then talking to my friends about me those friends not telling me what going on like things like that um and i'm very sad about it and if lose those friends really only have two friends which is so so sad um but i'm glad i'm part of the sorority now maybe this is what need maybe this is learning experience don't quite know um but i'm sad for sure am sad about it um pretty good day today had two interviews one got there decided didn't wanna do it um and had training from 1000 to 200 which was really fun i'm really excited i'm gonna be student groups liaison for [redacted] former uh mayor of minneapolis i'm just like really excited think this is gonna be great opportunity um and so hope that do really well and succeed and hope that get these other things that i'm applying for as well um but yeah i'm i'm really excited this is gonna be really really busy year or semester but think it will be well worth it um friendships i'm stressed feel like i've lost one of my best friends but that okay well it not okay but like i'm getting through the friend who feel sort of um played large role in the destruction of that friendship and [inaudible] came over and you know said he really didn't wanna do that and that it wasn't his intention or something like he would continue to do um but told him to just do whatever makes him happy um and to just sort of build home here and if that means being friends with my friends that fine because it not binary situation in which only he can be friends with them or can um but it does make things different [inaudible] quick however i'm not mad at him think i'm just mad at the situation and there nothing can do about it miss my friend of course but like it is what it is pretty good day today i'm super tired just like fell asleep for think it could have been like 10 minutes really don't know um but my body has been so tired yeah i've been fighting it so now i'm just listening and really just going to bed um mostly just got reading done um for today which was nice uh feeling good have to make calendar tomorrow before get to my meeting about my calendar um so that unfortunate but that gonna happen and yeah i'm just like really really tired and need to start getting more sleep and figuring out how to do that hmm [inaudible] that was really it really just did notes on my homework didn't really see lot of friends at all actually not good at that pretty gloomy day today um not only am getting pimples on my face but um feel like sorta missed out on hanging out with my friends today didn't really see anyone um and didn't get as much work done as wanted to so that was just like double whammy um and guess tomorrow will be doing the same thing except will be getting work done um so i'm just sort of getting used to not seeing my friends as often know saw them way too often last semester so i'm just trying to figure out the happy balance and with being happy and being [inaudible] feeling comfortable um also i'm like trying to go to bed earlier and stuff totally not working having trouble focusing staying on task get sad really wanna use my phone so just take it which is terrible um yeah i'm just wondering [when get] done mess feeling very negative right now hopefully tomorrow will be better but don't really know just felt like don't have fear of missing out just hate missing out and feel like that always happens so don't really know what to do about that other than that like genuinely did not see human beings today other than walking into [redacted] for like 10 minutes tops or seeing people in class that it so yeah it it was struggle today today has been work work work work work rush rush rush rush rush here there and everywhere had no time to do homework i'm so tired i'm not getting sleep face is breaking out i'm hungry don't even have time to eat and just like it don't know what i'm doing don't know what going on but like need sleep can't afford to have my face be breaking out right now want to do homework and be done at godly hour and go to bed at least wanna go to bed with my homework done and don't even think can do that i'm not frustrated i'm just so tired like wish that just had enough time in the day for these things or that knew what was doing so wouldn't end up like this i'm just like i'm so tired but got initiated today for fleur-de-lis which is for my [redacted] um and there were no sanctions for it so that was really really exciting um it was good moment wanted to feel confident in myself but had this huge pimple on my face so could only feel so much just don't like the way look right now at all like my face is just dying um went to mental health services today for my appointment once again i'm putting lot of pressure on myself need to just relax stop thinking about things i'm pretty sure have an ear infection and it killing me but don't have time to go to the doctor am so nauseous and my ear hurts my ears hurt actually so don't know what to do there either super busy day today um but felt pretty productive had to do some last-minute preparation and studying for an interview that had but it went well did well in my class today my seminar with the law professor was really happy about um saw some friends um not really loving the interactions i've been having with my friends constantly feel like an outsider um which is super unfortunate um and hate that feeling because know these people were my friends at one point and i'm wondering what sort of going on but also know that they have their own lives as well and i'm not their only friend and perhaps need to do the same thing that they've been doing um so which have um but yeah it just been kind of sad to realize makes me little bit nervous about blocking because i've said i'm gonna block with them already and i'm like pretty keen on it but um if they don't like me by the time that comes it gonna be really awkward and there also um yesterday my friend asked me if like this guy and you know said yes um but like the timing was sorta messed up and she asked if she could like pursue him and didn't really know what to say so she saw me in person today and asked didn't say no but was like like uncomfortable with it and like really wanna pursue him but at the same time know don't know how to do that um so we'll see but yeah so that just like super unfortunate and yeah am like really liking my academic self right now struggling with my social self um if have any friends if will have any friends if i'm just gonna be that girl that always doing something um and if that good or bad thing so don't know i'm little sad i'm actually quite sad but haven't had time to think about it yet so i'm going to bed 'cause don't want to feel emotions ever so yeah pretty okay day today um woke up meeting went to class had another meeting um then did little bit of work had an interview then did some more work and then hung out with some friends which was really exciting and it felt really good um one 'cause hadn't really hung out with them all week so it was good to see um them and it was just one friend um the friend that was most worried about losing um but things are good which is great and um yeah it was great ending to my day um i'm feeling better now um there lot of uh tension not tension there lot of questioning that needs to happen in terms of who my friends are and who i'm friends with in front of other people um and sort of what friends have considered good friends that have sort of been sabotaging other friendships um the friend that spoke to today that was worried about losing um we went to felipe after whatever and she was like you know rennie said that we call the our group of friends hello and this kid told the girl that just went out to felipe with that he felt that hello was saying goodbye and he said that said that and so didn't say that exactly didn't say hello was saying goodbye um but said you know think they may um leave me soon or like may fall out of that group unfortunately um and he he said that to someone else which was not great um and he didn't even say it to the girl that went to um felipe with he said it to another girl in our group and then that girl told the girl told who the girl went to felipe with then she told me and it just like what are these guys doing like come on it just it was just too much and like he said that like he considered me like his best friend and that like it just the term best friend has sort of been tainted for me in that don't even know what best friend looks like on college campus um which is super worrisome because think i've really defined my my people my happiness my relationships as like friendships and best friends um and that hard to deal with here but it definitely happening um other than that um it was sorta busy today but did feel sorta productive i'm hoping to be really productive tomorrow and go out tomorrow night maybe and then sunday go to church and do work um but i'm happy that today was uh it ended nicely pretty good day today would say am got into [redacted] which is like really big deal and so was really happy about that um sort of like woke up at like 600 which is equivalent to the middle of the night at this point in my life um and saw the email and was like happy remember laughing and then going back to bed um and then waking up to go again um but yeah so like that was fun was just training all day 1000 to 230 then something at 300 until 500 so [inaudible] really didn't get lot of time to do lot of homework um and also my eye got like really red all of sudden so came back from [redacted] um or urgent care like maybe 20-something minutes ago um oh that was really frustrating had very frustrating experience just because like it was really long wait and was anxious and really wanted to be doing homework but couldn't um [i think] i'm okay and yeah found out that um somebody else is blocking with us and didn't know and the person who blocking with us is the guy that has expressed interest in me um and that like we're not moving forward or anything 'cause like don't find him attractive or like not even that i'm just not attracted to him um so like that that little bit unfortunate quite unfortunate actually um yes that was interesting to to hear about guess by mistake which is awesome um and the other girls in the group they they know about the situation so it was just really interesting how everything playing out but you know keep telling myself i'm not just not gonna be home lot and i'm just gonna be busy which is true am going to make myself busy um but yeah other than that it really busy day same thing tomorrow so we'll see what happens long day today um still didn't do as much work as had hoped had more training today had presentation in the training that had like 45 minutes to prep for was super nervous um and not even because people were there but because like one of the people that consider very good friend and that what makes me the most nervous don't really like my closest friends to see my academic endeavors because i'm afraid like they won't be enough um and so that was unfortunate and don't think did very well but that okay um got aside my case study for and this training is all for an extracurricular that got into um it like big deal like us haven't gone to the gym in like week and can feel myself getting fat um so need to go but feel like don't have time um but i'm not gonna let last semester happen again so we will be making time for the gym feel so tired for did not get enough sleep but there no time for that um let see other things that happened today super stressful situation with blocking um had thought that we had already set our blocking group uh which is about six of us then um in some group chat this don't know one of my friends um decided or yeah one of them decided that we would be adding this new person in who guy and this guy is guy who expressed interest in me that don't like as as significant other like he an okay person like he good person like him as friend um and didn't know so that was new information that figured out like yesterday or something but then today also realized that that addition to our group wasn't so much of an addition as it was swap and they cut out another friend um and that was hard because as one of the girls in the group that i'm blocking with was texting the other girl saying like no um we sort of set up blocking group was in the same exact room with the other girl and so like it was very very weird and had to like not look at my phone because didn't wanna see any text messages that they could have been sending um it was just so stressful [inaudible] having [inaudible] just decided to have everyone so like both of the people that instead of swapping them we're just keeping both of them and am not happy about it have to say not happy um but feel like don't really have input mean do have input but it not worth my time so yeah now i'm just ready to go to bed do work in the school kid let me just do school really well you know so that what i'm gonna do pretty okay day today i'm sure tired um woke up early for doctor appointment and had like meetings where was running back and forth and just tried to do homework [inaudible] today um feeling accomplished i've finished homework for class that have due thursday so tomorrow i'm hoping to study for econ um things i've sort of been pushing back and then also i've got some work from one of my extracurriculars um the things are sort of piling up so think getting ahead is really good i'm glad i'm doing it um let see yeah mean i'm excited for this semester like i'm feeling like i'm really being productive um had to watch the [inaudible] videos today because felt like didn't know what was doing um and that ended up being actually really helpful i'm glad did that but i'm just so exhausted also went to meeting today that um composed of lot of black harvard just about like making the community more inclusive um [some tea] spilt um but yeah lot of good discussion healthy discussion so [inaudible] much but it learning experience i'm hoping to become bigger person on campus so i'm excited for that um but yeah um today did not do lot of work um which is scary um but did stay up really late because something due tomorrow at 500 for um hccg one of my extracurriculars don't think did it well don't think did it right but it was also my first time and we're learning so um hopefully things will be okay and i'm willing to work on it again until get it right am also um have something due at o'clock tomorrow so that is something need to get on and yeah i'm just like super tired hate going to bed this late um and not something want to be the norm but do like having lot of work um because it makes me be really productive which is awesome and think i'm getting smarter and i'm i'm i'm learning um so i'm just excited and think this is gonna be really big opportunity for me it gonna be something big um so i'm very grateful but yeah um ready to go to bed didn't get lot of work done today um had couple of meetings and thi well did get lot of work done in one class guess just like studying and doing the [p set] um for econ um but it just didn't feel like lot and feel super lost once again um so tomorrow is one of my bigge busiest days of the week if not the busiest so won't have time to do lot of work but am planning on going to an at 1000 thing at like 10 o'clock at night and then um yeah really just like printing out the readings from my other homeworks um but yeah thursdays are super busy so have an interview at 940 in the morning tomorrow um so just want to do really well i'm really worried about summer opportunities i'm going to really hope get these it'd be just be so amazing um but i'm really really excited at the prospect of being abroad over the summer um so i'm really really hoping do well there and yeah just really want to get good rest i'm worried about my exam on wednesday that don't know if i'm prepared for for econ but you know it it happening things are coming and going um so yeah i'm just preparing myself just really want to go to bed um have been productive feeling like maybe there just aren't enough hours in the day pretty okay day today um my friends got into some programs for studying abroad which didn't even know about didn't even know it was on the table so that was something that was really sad 'cause think it would've been something that would've loved to do um and unfortunately didn't know about the opportunity um which is really really unfortunate but can't really change that i'm worried about summer opportunities and hope things go really well um i'm just like super nervous about it 'cause really really really really really want to do something incredible you know and it lot of pressure to put on myself especially as freshman but kinda don't care um and have high expectations from myself and and think that worked for me um so yeah i'm just really worried about summer opportunities just wanna do something incredible something important um but yeah it really all that been on my mind just did lot of work on my [p-set] today um thursdays are my busiest days had an interview at 940 classroom 1000 to 1100 another classroom 1200 to 100 don't know 211 class 1100 to 1200 another class 100 to 300 had to be at study group for 415 for what do at the [redacted] um and that one till 545 then had to have meeting for the [redacted] at 700 and then worked on finishing the [p-set] and sort of like had the answers but wanted to do it and understand it uh so that what just spent the past like three hours doing um and so didn't do any other homework which is super disappointing but um yeah hopefully things get better pretty okay day today again this pattern of not getting as much work done as had hoped um went to class had meeting after that did work i've been struggling with one of my essays um have like three essays to do which is just so exciting and all 480-something pages of the book to read um so i'm really struggling with coursework and just staying on top of things been getting ahead it was okay now i'm not so need to figure that out again um let see and yeah had banquet tonight also went to party and um yeah so just like met lot of people partied with different types of people different people don't usually hang out with so that was exciting the experience different type of uh uh but yeah i'm just living i'm super tired but i'm going to try to read in bed before go to bed and yeah well also shopped today lot um today spent most of my time by myself was doing homework struggling with paper reading book um yeah again not getting the work that need to get done accomplished um struggling with time struggling with focusing uh which is huge issue need to figure it out but yeah i'm just like tired i'm gonna read before go to bed try to go to church in the morning so yeah absolutely exhausted um so much work to do paper do at o'clock tomorrow haven't even finished reading for it have to study for econ just like this is just terrible and i'm just so exhausted need to sleep um there just way too much on my plate right now tired like my eyes are burning like it took me like 15 minutes to read like page and half because the words were like getting blurry and stuff so really need to figure out my life and get my life together but i'm ready to go to bed now and it'd be done um today was busy woke up finished reading wrote response paper that was due at 400 got it done by like 1130 um then went to training that was from oh no maybe got it done at 1200 or something then went to training that was from 100 to 330 went to record music video from 330 to like 500 something then at 800 went to meeting from 600 to 830 then 630 to 830 excuse me and then went to the study session from 745 or 800 to 930 then did my homework where had slide to make for [accg] which is lot of research essentially and then did some no yeah that uh super unfortunate terrible time management and then am behind and have another paper due on wednesday at 1200 but also have an exam on wednesday so we're [welding] lot and i'm so stressed but also need to sleep and i'm supposed to be reading this thing right now but think i'm going to read it so can fall asleep and then wake up ready and go print to do homework that due tomorrow at 10 o'clock um that couldn't do because don't have printer because i'm not paying um even though tomorrow will have to pay despite the fact that am broke um let me think yeah so will be cramming for the next three days um absolutely and it gonna be such an experience hate this schedule right now um but also feels really productive so don't know what to do with my life essentially super tired once again um lots of work to do have to finish in the morning and wash it up but that what it is [inaudible] first today saw some friends that don't usually hang out with one on one or whatever but like really liked being with them which was awesome so that gonna help me in terms of making new friends um yeah just tired and can like barely keep my eyes open which is why i'm going to bed and was gonna read but it just not the information is not remaining in my head so yeah i'm just ready to sleep um really just like studied and did homework today had two meetings in class and that was it didn't have lunch not having three meals day anymore which is don't know is okay guess but not something love but feel like am gaining weight so it may be good that i'm not eating don't know um today was was okay it was beautiful outside so felt happy in the morning did work went to see my counselor and then went to class and studied then took my econ exam don't feel good about it at all feel like study for that class and it doesn't do anything so i'm really frustrated um and don't know how to fix anything so i'm really upset about that but am just moving forward not thinking about it being done um yeah so i'm just like you know i've cut econ out for good and i'm going to bed early because like my eyes hurt and haven't been getting enough sleep um and totally have work to do have an entire op-ed to write for the crimson due tomorrow at 700 have started absolutely not so i'll be getting at least six six and half hours of sleep tonight because i've only been getting like five something which is terrible um so could wake up early do work but yeah so have to go because thursdays have absolutely no time to do anything so yeah i'm exhausted and disappointed in myself really tired ready to go to bed wanted to read two chapters for econ only got through one it was so long it was like 20 or 30 pages um of text but so that was unfortunate and also had to take shower just 'cause really needed to shower super stressful day had lot of work working before deadlines just not like an ideal day and so yeah was tired really frustrated got to call my dad tomorrow 'cause didn't snap at him today but felt kind of not nice and didn't like that so think he [inaudible] um yeah don't know i'm just i'm stressed but i'm not stressed but know should be stressed so guess have lot of work to do and there are no hours in the day that could let me get me ahead so just need to figure out how to do that and think i'm just going to stop seeing people and just be by myself all the time and maybe that'll help me grow and be productive so yeah have lot to do today i'm going to bed way too late way way way too late but of course [inaudible] um i'm super tired getting sick from being tired like literally sick um my [life] is mess my eyes are getting red feel like i'm getting pink eye um have like stuffed nose um i'm exhausted i've lost my appetite get dizzy um yeah so life is going not-so-great have to do work for 130 tomorrow um at this rate don't think i'll be waking up until 1000 because need to get sleep i'm like so over it but also need to do my nair [nails] um which opens at 1000 so i'm really just struggling like immensely um so yeah life sucks right now um not feeling good about schoolwork but you know that not different from any other time today was interesting um woke up in the morning had to get my nails done for ball we had tonight um did that did some work went to brunch did little bit more work and then got ready for this ball which was pretty underwhelming and disappointing but um you know it is what it is got some better connections with guy i'm interested in which was good um realized that one of my friends that friend has expressed interest in me but that didn't really feel back for him uh like i'm not interested in him but he like really good person and really like having him as friend um yeah felt like wanted to be really dressy and really like pop out for this event um and didn't feel as dressed up or felt dressed up but didn't feel like was as pretty as those around me and think lot of it roots from searching or only really believing that look pretty because other people tell me or in other words validation from others um which is terrible terrible thing had really good conversation with my friend la this tonight which is pretty helpful not really having me solve my problems but in saying that other people are in the same boat as well where they don't feel like they exactly belong at harvard and things um yeah was gonna go to the afterparty then decided not to just just didn't feel like it so me and two other friends went to jefe and then we went and we watched this like nigerian movie so you know things happened but i'm just exhausted and have to wake up to go to church tomorrow so just ready for bed really tired going to bed kind of early tonight so can wake up early and do work planning to meet with my professor or tf so we can work on economics together i'm feeling really worried about um summer plans and not knowing any professors here um my friend is basically got an internship with his professor to do some research which is absolutely fantastic and wished that had connected with someone like that you know but it okay i've just got to keep trying keep going i'm nervous but think it'll be okay i'm just so exhausted so i'm going to go to bed because just went to church this morning then did work then went to dinner and then did more work i'm having really hard time focusing which is really bad so one class took lot longer than i'd hoped um [inaudible] doing work and now i'm sort of worried to walk into my [inaudible] class tomorrow but essay barely changed um however we'll see how things go what was supposed to do don't even know um so have to wake up early tomorrow um yeah so i'm gonna get about five hours of sleep not good but we're working on it and this won't happen again think i'm gonna go to the library from now on to study so i'm excited for that um think i'll be more productive and focused and yeah i'm just really looking forward to go to bed so can wake up and do my work have something due at 500 tomorrow that i've barely started so that for an extracurricular considered quitting the crimson today um because really have no time for it but the people really really like me and really want me to write and totally understand me quitting but their enthusiasm about my writing has sort of pushed me to do lot now so don't have to do it later so i'm excited pretty good day today was pretty productive got lot of work done ready to do the same thing tomorrow um spoke with some of my friends last night little bit today just about um my endeavours in to in terms of finding relationship or being in relationship think that something that want so i'm don't know if i'm actively looking but am currently aware that that what want um and so spoke to friend of mine who pretty close friends with two guys that would be interested in um so that just an interesting thing that sort of hanging around the back of my mind um buy yeah don't really know um just sort of going through think i'm just gonna see what happens um let see yeah that really it didn't see lot of people today except for one friend um who sort of was having trouble with in the middle of don't know guess the in-between part of last semester and this semester but like really think he really good friend and think forgot that um and don't don't think ever wanna lose him as friend he just very good person so that just not gonna happen so i'm happy i've come to that realization getting annoyed by another friend group that have um with someone who giving me lot of trouble and stress um but somehow felt like owed um and i'm like really over that mentality now so yeah i'm just very aware ready to do well here i'm psycha excited um today has been okay had lot of work lot of meetings to go to to figure out who my big would be um so yeah that was just that that took up lot of my time today hopefully won't have to waste that much time ever again so have so much work think have to drop an extracurricular um yeah it it gonna happen my skin is super dry um am not getting as much sleep as would like to um i'm not thriving but i'm getting things done um yeah surviving not thriving breathing um but yeah i'd say overall today actually wasn't like terrible day do feel like there little bit of tension with one of my friends but i've decided that i'm just like i'm not gonna care and i'm not gonna do anything about it and like if she wants to be friends if she wants to fix things like she'll come because last time we had like little thing it was like only me that cared so am just gonna let things happen whatever occurs occurs if she doesn't wanna fix it that'll be awkward but it'll pass even though we'll be living together it okay um we'll get through it you know so i'm just gonna wait that out and see what happens pretty good day today um went to bed late last night woke up had meeting at 930 went really well i'm excited for paper that i'm gonna write think it gonna be really cool it gonna be really great um caught the crimson today um which is one thing that was confident that definitely didn't have time for um and think made the right decision it sad um but think i'm still gonna send in pieces and let see um yeah just basically worked on my econ set so um i'd actually done most of it throughout the week and there was just one more problem that had and it had 25 parts to it um and it was like sort of the longest question there um but it like doing excel and things so it not like it not too terrible um that what spent most of my time doing um so it really wasn't that bad wasn't don't know if i'd consider it cramming but um it was due tomorrow it is due tomorrow um got into two summer programs today um one an internship to peru the other one to mexico um in mexico city so was really excited about that when saw uh the first one actually like shed couple of tears um which was really exciting 'cause was really nervous about it and afraid that wasn't gonna have anything for the summer when shared that information with my parents didn't quite get the response that i'd expected um but in hindsight really should've expected um their reactions as anything abroad really just scares them um but yeah so mean that that we'll see what happens but met someone really cool today um so i'm hoping to email them to maybe um have the opportunity to work with them over the summer perhaps um yeah i'm just i'm i'm excited things are like coming together i'm feeling better about econ was able to do some parts by myself which was good um have lot of emails to do didn't get as much work done today as wanted but feel accomplished with the set so i'm happy um today was pretty busy and again had meetings and went to two events didn't get lot of homework done or nearly as much as i'd hoped um but again just gonna have another long night and my mom is coming down tomorrow so i'm really excited to see her haven't seen her in while feel like haven't spoken to her in while either so i'm excited for that and just to tell her how things have been going here um had meeting with an extra-curricular group that i'm in um where we do work for like other companies and expressed some frustration with the work that they were giving me in that they're not really giving me clear assignments and then they're also not using the work that give which takes quite some time some three to five hours would say um and so that was really frustrating so emailed um my like higher person about it so we'll see what happens about that but i'm glad that that on the table now um i'm interested in someone here who not someone that i'm like friends with particularly um but like hope things go well he looking for as they say like wife now he not trying to mess around anymore uh i'm not just trying to be side piece so that nice um guess we'll see where things go haven't really like did math with him last semester so like we like can converse but um i'm not like close with him but maybe that'll change so that thing that been on my mind um think that pretty much it yeah feeling like i'm not i'm in like sorority that not sorority anymore and feel like i'm not quite participating in it as much as should be but met someone today um who also like part of it and had never met her um but she is part of it and is not very involved and she like fine and was like okay maybe now is just not the right time really tired ready to go to bed so i've lot of work to do i'm finished reading for one class today but didn't finish the paper which is due tomorrow at 400 so need to get that done also i'm the only person responding and feel like i'm the only person doing things in my um iop student group so that really annoying soon i'm gonna have to wake up early and bring [redacted] to [redacted] but yeah i'm just super frustrated with that but you know that that um i'm over everything am over one of my friends he was just so annoying today and got really frustrated with him um and like in the back of my mind know i've been like sort of drifting away from him and it not that it was on purpose but i'm happier think when i'm just you know chilling without him and that sounds bad but that not really what mean 'cause like these past couple days have been fine they've been little bit less stress than normal and don't know if that because of him or not and um he had today just really got me really upset and didn't really know what to do one of my um actual guests for the iop who i'm liaising for um brought in guest who mentioned something during her 12-step recovery plan um to addiction um about telling certain people certain things like you know really love you and care about you um but this isn't working for me and there have to be consequences for you hurting me um and that has been coming back to me lot especially in relation to this guy and and like we're friends and that the issue we're just friends and feel the stress with him which is really annoying um but yeah it just like it ridiculous and it keeps coming to my head whether should you know say something like that to him but i'll have to choose if i'm gonna say hey like care about you love you but can't be friends because it hurting me or say there are certain there are you know consequences for hurting me um and that may constitute me like leaving the room or like not talking to him and that feels sort of terrible um because it feels like i'm like punishing him which makes like puts me on pedestal that we all know i'm not on um then also [inaudible] sort of like mother and child like just like it just really weird that not what wanna do but also do need to protect myself and think it important to tell him hey like there are some things just can't deal with with what you do and sometimes i'm really gonna have to walk out or walk away from you um because can't deal with it so prob don't know maybe that'll happen soon pretty unproductive day today supposed to be light day where had um time didn't feel like got any of the work done that i'd hoped to which was super disappointing yet something that feel like am constantly saying so think will be isolating myself for the next couple of days um until [housing day] so yeah just getting through until spring break but i'm just super tired need to go to bed need to stop wasting time and to do homework by myself um and that it that just it that it okay day today uh did essentially one piece of work tried to but nothing new i'm really tired i'm ready to go to bed i'm having awful awful cramps so um on top of struggling to focus i'm in lot of pain um don't take medicine but i've been taking medicine and it not helping as much as i'd hope it would um so think that been part of my struggle today of just really staying focused unfortunately housing day is on thursday today is technically wednesday um and am excited have been kind of awkward with um one of my future blockmates um and we were really really close before and think things have fallen apart i'm not sure if there'll ever be they will ever be normal um but you know at this point can't really do anything about it and if she doesn't want to you know be friend i'm not gonna force her to do that um because think everyone deserves to be happy and then not have the weight of trying to please someone and that not fulfilling to you so am i'm just gonna let that go and just see what happens try to be as neutral as possible but um other than that am super ready to go to bed so that what i'm doing now and when wake up in the morning and go to tutoring go to class and then try to get as much work done as possible and before tomorrow night pretty okay day today um about to go to bed sleeping with my block mates right now um and yeah haven't felt too great about my relationship with one of the girls in my [blocking] group um really really wanna be friends with her like we were but i'm not sure if that feeling is reciprocated but yeah so i'm just gonna go to bed now sleep it off see what happens what'll happen will happen have faith in the process excited for tomorrow it supposed to be good day so i'm just gonna stay positive pretty okay day today got my housing assignment i'm in [redacted] um think decided that will not block with my won't room with my block mates but we'll be in the same house which is nice um yeah had conversation with friend today who actually in my blocking group that haven't really spoken to for little over week which is lot for us and that lot for harvard think um and she just sort of explained that our group of friends sort of the things that we have been talking about lately which guess has been mostly guys has been um an uncomfortable experience for her where um she sort of feels like she can't relate um and it something that stresses her out and she doesn't feel like we're people that she can talk to about her struggles with that so she been very distant um and obviously as would say one of the people that are closest to her in the group um was the first to notice and had reached out while ago to see if she was okay and she just sort of blew me off um and so you know after spending the night together and then um having another awkward interaction today she sent text message uh asking for us to like meet and figure out why things are still awkward and so that happened and started just to let her talk 'cause didn't really have much to say didn't want to say anything 'cause think was mad and and didn't even know um but she really expressed just not feeling one with the group of friends that we've made she feels like she can't talk to us about her issues which is which was sad to me because always felt like was that person for her um for the past six months at least um so that was hard for me to take because felt like not only had been terrible friend but thought was doing better um and it like it just didn't matter like the history that we had and the times that we have shared um really deep and important things with each other it was like that sort of all blew away um and so you know as she saying this i'm on my period and it hasn't been this bad in really long time so part of it think may be that um but have been like not quite getting panic attacks but like have to leave the situation start sweating and start breathing heavy and like sometimes cry sometimes just walk around like don't know um and like i've been shaking for like two days now which is fantastic um but essentially she said those things and all those thoughts started flooding into my head and said okay um wow and left the room and after left the room sat on the stairs and cried for bit and started sweating then texted friend who also lives in the same building to see if he was there and tried to talk to him he also made me feel worse about myself which was interesting um and for some reason stayed because don't put myself before others and then today um another friend who also in the blocking group told me that um his mom just um found out that she had kidney cancer um first stage very early on um but that was something that he was really dealing with um and so tried to help him with that too so there lot of information coming in um today and don't really know what to do about it pretty okay day today um sat in car for most of the time just traveling from [redacted] to north carolina we're currently in [redacted] um i'm doing trip for habitat humanity so we're just really in the process of travel right now um had some good conversations with my friend feeling not great about my body right now um feeling overweight but we're getting through it hopefully things will get better i'm excited for this um opportunity and think i'm gonna make some new friends which is good um yeah pr just ready for tomorrow gotta sleep though um today again was spent mostly in the car um traveling but we finally made it i'm excited um to have made it and get this journey started hopefully my health stays good um so excited to do well hopefully lose weight on this trip hmm yeah just wanna get my work done i'm really worried about this paper that have to do um but you know i'm just gonna stay positive stay determined stay focused um feel like i'm getting fat feel like can see double chin forming even when i'm just sitting straight um but it hard um which is like essentially me saying it doesn't feel like just fat or chub which is little scary um but that okay and i'm just focused on like making good connections here and getting my work done pretty good day today um hung out with group did some good bonding sort of felt like an idiot um feel like i'm portraying myself as someone who not very smart just 'cause there are some things don't know like there dairy and butter guess um and things like that but i'm excited for tomorrow we're doing some work funnily hope to be more productive wasn't very productive today at that school work which is such problem but we'll get through it everything needs to get done and need to do it and [that all] so i'm excited i'm ready for tomorrow just wanna need to go to bed 'cause that gonna mean early and long day so yeah pretty good day today um it was productive um and also had really great time working today and so i'm feeling good feeling like i'm eating super unhealthy so need to control my eating which is really hard to do but it will get tough and i'm going to come back to school looking great and yeah really wanna change my look and just be beautiful to myself whatever comes comes what doesn't doesn't right now i'm just gonna be [inaudible] student [inaudible] so good so yeah pretty good day today um struggled at the actual site and doing work um definitely took little bit of my confidence um uh you know we stay strong i'm worried about my weight feel like i'm getting double chin and my face is fat but you know it is what it is we're working on it uh nothing can do in the very moment um decided to go home really wanna get this paper done and so i've been working on it um been pretty productive would say um yeah and i'm ready to go to bed 'cause want eight hours of sleep so can wake up tomorrow and feel rested didn't get lot of sleep last night um but yeah just just ready for tomorrow excited i've been having really great experience here pretty good day today i'm super tired um felt [pretty physical] today which was nice so got pretty good workout and didn't eat did so badly today um i'm just so exhausted didn't get enough work done today at all um which is tragic but yeah am so tired i'm like trying to read and my eyes are closing um my friend that was closer to at the beginning of the year and got mad at lot was attracted to don't think am anymore um guy-friend person um asked if was mad at him today and i'm not mad at him but do feel distance um just because of the things that he sort of been doing it sort of been like one bad thing after another um i'm not quite sure how to tell him know my therapist while ago said that to start doing things in person and not over text um to work on confrontation and things um so said nothing was wrong when he asked me but knew mean do know that something is wrong just need to figure out how to say that guess um so that sort of been on my mind but i've been trying to give him as little of my time as possible because it not worth it but yeah and now i'm just ready for bed pretty great day today um did lot of awesome work at the site today um again i'm in [redacted] right now working for [redacted] over spring break um and yeah so that felt great um feel like i'm making some good friends here which is also really exciting hopefully those relationships stay strong really hope they do um and we went to sky zone after which was some more bonding um just felt really good i'm sad that this has to end i'm not sure have been as productive as would like to be but have gotten some work done which think is saying something um let see yeah genuinely felt really happy today got lot of exercise that always great so yeah now i'm just tired really for bed my back hurts um was gonna do some more reading but think i'm gonna go to bed um uh than work in the car and then [inaudible] when we get to the hotel pretty good day today um was just on the on the road the whole time um just traveling we're now in [redacted] tomorrow i'll be getting back to [redacted] and then have dinner with my mom at 600 so i'm really really hoping we get back on time it for her birthday so it super important um yeah today got what wanted to get done which was great um and had some drinks-ish with group that have been with for the past week so that was interesting um yeah now i'm just ready to go to bed pretty good day today spent most of it on the road um got back to [redacted] um from [redacted] um at around 400 um then freshened up and went to my mum birthday dinner that just me and my mum and my dad and it was really really nice um love seeing them really missed them um and i'm happy when i'm with them which is great and is new feeling um and let see told them about my summer plans um that am thinking about going to [redacted] think it'll be really cool experience um and that'll be good for me so that little bit relieving well i'm also still hoping for some good news from [redacted] but we'll see um other things yeah reviewed an econ chapter today um didn't read [inaudible] apparently that due tomorrow but did all of my laundry which was completely necessary 'cause had no clothing and and i'm not really stressed about it um because did all the stuff that like need to do for tomorrow which is like interview prep and things um i'm interviewing other students for my paper that due friday um would say that the only thing that sort of been little bit of stressor and where think i've i've done the parts that are like somewhat easy and now just have to do like the actual um analysis of my research which isn't awful um but yes so i'm kind of excited but know it'll take long time and need to make time for that um and i'm also hoping to sort of keep the same schedule that did over this last week where i'm going to bed at like 1200-1230 um waking up 800-700 um and yeah just think it it better for me feel better and healthier and so i'm gonna try to do that and get as much work done during the day as possible um today started fine sort of felt my mood drop tell me about the campus don't wanna be here but am but let see started okay um didn't actively avoid um male friend that had been giving me lot of stress um before break but just didn't give him lot of my time or the time that usually give him and then think that they that may have been the last straw for him where he had been asking me lot like what wrong like did do something wrong are you mad at me and kept saying no because like didn't wanna talk about it didn't wanna make big deal out of it um but met with him today and just speak about it and wasn't really able to say lot in person which is something that really struggle with where don't i'm not used to saying how feel um so it really hard for me and the thing is that can do it with other people but with him for some reason just can't and can't tell him that either um but yeah uh so that in person did not end very well um where told him that yeah was having like little breakdown um it was it was like little bit of panic attack um friday before we left thu-thursday um and yeah thursday and asked if he was home to say hi or whatever didn't know when he was leaving and he kept badgering me about what was wrong like why was stressed why had been crying before and now i'm fine and said don't wanna talk about it multiple times and then eventually told him and he like interrupted me while was talking and was like oh so you just came to right your wrongs it was like that wa that really frustrated me lot and and so today had mentioned that as one of the several things that he'd done that really um made me angry and reminded me of home um just like the stress felt there of like even when do what i'm told i'm still wrong and when told him today um after over text message which am not supposed to be doing my therapist said for me to do these things in person and not over text message to bolster my skills um that he knows me he knows my background he knows like what i'm able to do and what i'm not and so don't understand how he doesn't know when he does something wrong and and don't understand why he thinks that it okay in to keep pushing me to share these things and then not even apologize when he does something wrong so that was sad he ended up apologizing over text message um after explained to him lot of what was frustrating me so that was emotionally taxing for bit and made it hard to focus but i'm just gonna go to bed now finished um my reading for my seminar tomorrow have lot of work to do lot lot of things so have to do that as well um really really tired um it was very productive today though didn't get everything off of my list um but definitely got good chunk um of what needed to get done which which it was good um meeting with my friend tomorrow um because we've been really awkward even before break um and we haven't really been able to get back to our norm and like today just was really bothered by it um and think she saw that was bothered um and asked me about it over text message and then we decided to get breakfast tomorrow morning um to just like talk and like get back to normal so hopefully that goes well um hate going to bed this late but like got stuff done um and think i'm just going to isolate myself um which isn't healthy but it'll let me be productive and at least i'll be good student if i'm not great happy human being um so yeah feel good about that really wanna go to bed 'cause have to wake up at 800 um super unsustainable lifestyle though and need to study for economics but have yet to do that which is terrifying 'cause really need to do well and yeah so those

be really really really hard day but i'm gonna sleep sleep sleep and things will be good just have to get through this week and study for econ um long day again today super tired still not done with two things due tomorrow uh hate this feeling haven't had time to study for econ it just like the same things are happening over and over again just don't know what to do but today my group that am the executive developer for had competition which they won and now they're gonna [inaudible] [yard] fest which is fantastic um but yeah so that was good but now i'm super tired need to sleep pretty good day today um finished paper uh that was pretty important to me it pretty big really liked it it was [card] but now that it over i'm really glad did it think it big stepping stone um also worked with [redacted] which is group that i'm part of part of um and just sort of like saw more faces got to meet more faces which was great um really like this guy and so i'm trying to figure out you know how to like manoeuvre that situation um woke up this morning and finished my [p-set] that was due at 1200 and then after that went to career fair and after that went to take photos for [redacted] then did work and then went to the gym then then went to surprise birthday party for like tw 15 20 minutes then went to the gym then did work had dinner was supposed to be at then was late to my [big little] reveal and then worked on my essay and finished it about an hour and change before it was done mean due so it been like go go go day but now that that essay is done really feel like want to be able to breathe but know can't because have to study for econ but things just feel better um so i'm ready to be really productive tomorrow um which always say and we all know what happens but tomorrow i'm gonna try hard um but i'm getting sleep tonight need to catch up on the sleep so i'm not setting an alarm [inaudible] yeah that my day pretty good day today was very productive and studied essentially all day or good portion of the day for economics which felt good still have lot more to do but i'm feeling more and more prepared which is awesome and spoke little to some other uh friends um and for the past like three three and half hours was speaking with two friends that got close with and think still am close with um and it was really nice to talk to them had good time with them which is great yeah we talking about rooming and blogging and i'm not going to room with my blogging group but will be maybe rooming with one of the girls in the blogging group who was added last minute um just because there lot of tension and not within our group but there lot of potential tension and don't need that don't want to come home to that so yeah that that and we spoke lot about how one of our mutual friends sort of made us feel and sort of the issues um that we have with him and what his actions um evoked so that was just really interesting discussion to have but now i'm going to bed um because have to go to church tomorrow so yeah um today was an interesting day was excited to go to church went to church had great experience um got to brunch saw two friends on the way there had really funny conversation walked in made waffle had really fun conversation um with guy i'm really interested in which was great sat by myself to eat was excited to just dine and dash then um friend came over who i've been really close with um guy friend i've been really close with um and he sort of like put his tray down and was like we need to talk we have problem um and didn't answer any of his calls last night because feel like he been putting lot of emotional strain um in my day-to-day life and and it not that he doing anything wrong um think i'm just inco unconfident and um it it hard on me because he there're certain things that he does that reminds me of my dad and it not like it triggering but it-it something that i've been trained to stay away from and say that in quotes because my mom has always been very forward about saying um about being able to recognize those traits and um to just just have eyes open at all times and since seeing those guess have been distancing myself lately um this conversation we have still don't know how productive it was um we definitely got like not frustrated or yelling at each other or anything like that but like impassioned um about what we were saying and think it was eye-opening for him told him that he didn't think he thought was smart or had any mental capacities um and he was really taken aback by that um and was surprised at his reaction because genuinely think that he does not think i'm smart and didn't say this but in my mind felt like if were if weren't attractive to him he wouldn't talk to me and um that sorta scared me and just other things that have happened within our relationship have made me really tense so in distancing myself guess i've been little bit less stressed but um i've been putting stress on him i'm really important friend to him and he very important friend to me and um think now may be at risk of losing that friendship which is really unfortunate um and hope not and sent text after our discussion just saying like know things are tense but lot of it is just me and my self-esteem and so i'm sorry and hope we can work things out and he never responded and know he was just paying me back because didn't respond to text that he sent um that was apologizing but yeah so i've just been thinking about that bit i'm not sure what to do but um guess that what been on my mind today um easily one of the worst days i've had um lot of things [inaudible] with blocking group um had mentioned that wasn't sure if wanted to room with him everything went down from there people say he fucked us over he screwed us over um no one was gonna say anything uh because [inaudible] um just like all these things um then had panic attack and then um my friend who in the group who also mentioned that he may not be rooming with him found me took me to his room and has calmed me down bit just sat there shaking for quite some time and texted one of the girls outside of the group chat that i'm closest to um just said really needed her went to room 13 to get help um yeah uh terrible terrible terrible day also got like little bit of closure with other guy friend um i'm thinking this week i'm just going to stay in my room not going anywhere i'm not seeing anyone not eating not like none of that um yeah i'm i'm in really really low spot right now so i'm just gonna probably cry myself to sleep today was really really interesting day went to be so depressed last night woke up pretty depressed um had one meal today that my dad delivered and um stayed in the library all day didn't talk to anyone and messaged few few people over text um just to really apologize for like the blocking group situation and ask if could block with them um yeah so that was really interesting i'll probably do it again tomorrow but um texted one girl that i'm very close with in the blocking group we haven't been close for little bit because some things were going down guess don't know um and we had really really i'll say it was good heart-to-heart um and she sort of like ignored me or like uh cut me out for some time this semester it really really did hurt me and don't think she knew that until today um and like she knew like it had an impact on me think but not to the extent that it did mean she felt bad um about how she acted throughout the whole thing because she said like she could see that was sad like visibly in our class that we had together and like people asked her about it and people asked why we didn't hang out that much anymore people that didn't see us together very often um and you know when told her like that i'm getting panic attacks and i'm just depressed and [inaudible] and just like lie in corner in my bed um think that was her realization and she felt like in seeing me sad and and not doing anything she was being bad friend and it was not an an accurate reflection of how she defined friends and so she cried we cried about that for while um tried to tell her that it wasn't her fault and that was bad friend too and that couldn't be the person that she needed um in terms of support but it was like very interesting conversation and it was learning experience for me um in terms of like people saying like messed up like yeah and apologize for that and like really meaning it and what that looks like um it was really interesting and she was like really really upset with herself and tried to comfort her but she didn't want that she felt like she wasn't supposed to be the attention right now and that um she was she didn't deserve to be comforted and that was hard to see but it ended well things are fine now and hopefully they'll get better so another member of the blocking group and things are okay so things have improved but i'm still not gonna see anyone tomorrow and i'm just prepping for my exam tomorrow night really really really late night need to go to bed have o'clock meeting in the morning um just really had lot of work to do and mid-term that was sitting for um all my work is sort of overloading am [inaudible] and didn't sleep which is terrible just like really really don't like it um so that will be fixed this weekend um will be ahead of schedule it just gonna happen um but yeah really ready to go to bed um interesting social interactions today had meeting with the group that i'm part of um there little bit of tension and one of my close friends um messaged me and just said that you know he wished that i'd stood up for him um and that didn't do good job of that and this is someone that recently had conversation with saying that that some of the things that he does makes me feel not so great about myself um and he characterized it as him being bad friend but think it just him being little bit um unaware of how he makes others feel but that work in progress um so it just interesting to hear that um being said to me while someone else yesterday ra made that realization themselves about how they were treating me and so that just really really interesting um and apologized for that and and taking responsibility um but yeah just super weird liking this guy lot lot thinking that he may well i've heard that he may just give up in my until next semester um which is really really unfortunate 'cause really like him but you know it is what it is guess today um felt pretty isolated would say um didn't realize that was like actively avoiding people until went to um the [institute of politics] today to do quick thing before had separate meeting and changed my route twice to avoid people um and then on top of that when was there was just like hit with sadness where could see it on my face you can see it um and [it was to start a] book wanted to get out didn't want to be around people di just didn't wanna do it um yeah so that was really hard really interesting to see then met with my donor which was really amazing um with the scholarship donor guess really awesome people from rhode island felt at home for little bit felt comfy felt happy [felt ready] um the daughter goes to law school here and she sort of gave me some great words of wisdom to uh just make sure get really good grades here um then got back from classroom-to-table thing with my professor and someone asked about rooming i've decided to room with the blocking group um and then find out that um three of them three of the other girls um are at birthday dinner for one of the upperclassmen um she sophomore guess um that also know um and was not invited but they were all there um they had all sort of been in cahoots um guess and in filling out their blocking form they left one girl out because they wanted quad and then left her out because don't want to room with her boyfriend as well but um yeah that was really interesting to see and was sad so threw my phone somewhere else that was so wouldn't look at the snapchat stories anymore um but it just really interesting to hear people who are worried about divisions in the group go about doing things that only include certain people in the group but yeah that that guess today was pretty interesting day had conversation with someone for internship this morning decided that i'll be going to [redacted] this summer um which is good little nerve-wracking um tried to get work done had lot of meetings was super unsuccessful in getting any work done um feeling don't know how i'm feeling right now um drank today tried like don't even know what it was maybe shot or something um it was fine it was fine with it with my friends um it was like normal guess went to two different parties um and don't know like was fine with it was like it not necessarily something that would like crave or really do again because want to um but did want to like know what it felt like um but saw lot of my friends that he considered pretty close um and like think he could tell that had drank mean he was like very very just um don't know he was really standoffish he like actively avoided me it was really really interesting um but he also someone that feel like is unhealthy for me um and is not doesn't quite have positive impact on me at all but mostly what happened today um yeah also danced with guy that like so hopefully that goes well um yeah so it was like good and bad talked about my parents today but yeah so think things are little off with my dad so i'm going to try to fix that but yeah that it today was pretty good day um woke up got reasonable amount of sleep um played myself and said was gonna do homework and went to the gym instead and then did went to breakfastlunch and did little bit more homework and sat with friend um and it was good to just have conversation with him about how things are going how his night was 'cause hadn't seen him and then um from there went to an even with one of the organizations that i'm in um where it was lot of effort just to like talk to people and make small talk 'cause didn't really care for the people that were there um and found some of them just like really annoying as much as wanted to relate to them and when got home um contacted my dad to go to another um religious event and that was sort of stressful um just sitting there knowing that that not gonna be religion that practice and that um still have to interact with those people as if it something i'm really considering um so yeah that was just like lot of effort and think it was very noticeable that was uncomfortable and was pretty like angry about the things that were being said um but yeah then came back home did work and then um friend contacted me to get ice cream and i'm pretty into him so that was cool um was somehow outgoing which never happens so that was new but yeah and then went to see my friend and now i'm here with them and yeah i'm just gonna go to sleep and go to church tomorrow and try to be as productive as possible today was pretty rough um went to church got phone call from my dad while was there he didn't know that was like going to churches or whatever um that didn't go very well and he eventually decided to try to meet with me later and discuss religion essentially as whole um and we're that was where he told me that he doesn't really he not very good at practicing his own religion and that he doesn't want me to deal with religion at this point in my life um and disgree with that he he just wants me to focus on school and he thinks that religious people are very manipulative um so that was really interesting conversation to have spoke i've spoken to my friend that i'm pretty close to who guy who seem to always talk about unfortunately um and feel sad but don't know what supposed to happen there so i'm just gonna let things happen and yeah really tired had lot of work didn't finish it spent lot of time dealing with emotional things with my dad um yeah so now i'm just really ready to go to bed wasn't terrible day today went to the gym this morning um went to class i'm little behind the econ then had was on my way back from the gym learned that had like three other meetings today that didn't know about so went to those and didn't have the time thought had to do the work that needed to do either way got some good work done um well now that think about it got got work done there are things that are finished um have to watch movie i'm gonna watch little bit now and then i'm gonna watch the rest in the morning it for class at 10 o'clock tomorrow but yeah wonder what my friend [inaudible] feel like i'm losing who was close to early in the semester and last semester but i'm gonna let things happen it like was looking for signs and really like someone to be telling me that like he not good for me just gotta drop people so that that and yeah so now on my way to bed leaving the library and i'm super tired and i'm just gonna try to really focus on school have presentation on thursday so i'm just compartmentalizing my emotions and it working so well oh my goodness feel relaxed feel like rock love it so yeah today was uh um interesting day went about my day as normally not getting enough sleep um another class having some things bother me mentor who another friend is not really talking to me right now don't know if he'll come back miss him know he not good for me but really do miss him and miss our friendship um and today one of our mutual friends told me that he said i'm terrible friend that hit me hard because that something pride myself on one of the very few things that do so that really sucked then said to him [inaudible] much you'd stay here when you're just gonna drop me and be done with it and he was like you have your friends which guess was yes and he didn't respond to my message back to that which is really shitty um which guess should take as sign and everybody says he bad for me and know that he bad for me but here am crawling back to him just like my mom does to my dad but i'm gonna fix it it'll be fine um yeah so got really sad about that but decided to do work and just push emotions to the side which is something i'll be doing more it hard to to practice but i'm getting better at it um i'm just really tired have presentation the slideshow is at 12 o'clock even tomorrow and have one more slide plus i'm gonna wake up early and do it i'm just really tired so i'm gonna go to bed um but yeah worked out today i've been listening to the same two songs over and over again um so don't fall on the floor and cry but yeah i'm feeling depressed um depression is really think sort of been coming up over the past week or two um yeah i'm just not happy don't genuinely smile or genuinely laugh anymore so it hard but here we are um getting some sleep tonight which i'm happy about um did lot of work today got some good things done feeling better about my presentation tomorrow i'm just gonna sort of wing it and go through it and hopefully things go well no i'm not gonna wing it 'cause i've been practicing and think it gonna be good um am looking forward um to getting it over with um starting the weekend know it only thursday but it pretty big deal and i'm realizing that have lot of mid-terms and papers all within the same league so need to get started on those like now um and know that gonna be struggle because struggle with doing things before they're due um but that was something that been on my mind for bit i'm doing better with dealing emotionally with friends um and got invited to finals club party um which guess is like punching almost or pre-punching um but none nobody else in my closest friend group got in and one of my friends who in the friend group um approached me about it and like wanted to meet with me like in person like about it and was like check your email and did you get this invite and was like no didn't um but then when looked actually did he was like yeah can you bring me with you um and he wanted me to be like he wanted to be plus one guess and he didn't get an email or wasn't on the list and don't know if this is like an all-girls one or what but it was really really interesting um in the moment was like yeah whatever that fine but um that was different also don't really like the social club that i'm part of right now feel like i'm paying just to drink and don't even go to the parties so that that yeah long day today um was able to get some work done of course again not everything that had hoped to get done um but made some progress finished problem set for economics which was pretty big for me was able to do lot of it by myself got time to really um work on it independently which think is extremely important and was really happy to do um big tomorrow have an interview tomorrow expose meeting tomorrow there tomorrow have two parties to go to but i'm really hoping to get lot of work done and so wanna be as productive as possible before these parties um yeah this weekend has to be really productive have to start looking ahead at my exam schedule and other things so it gonna be sort of like um chill grind where i'm just trying to get ahead so yeah um really long day today um didn't get that much sleep last night and started early this morning for 1000 meeting wasn't as productive as i'd hoped to be after classes and meetings and interviews um which is really really unfortunate um so i'm planning to be super productive tomorrow but also am planning on sleeping i'm not setting an alarm um think need to give my body break um know do have lot of work but at the same time can't uh we went to party today and some girls wanted some drinks so they drank and one of my friends um she didn't even drink that much but guess it was just too much for her and she was really sad about some thing you know subconsciously that she'd been trying to push push away and sort of heal from um she got really drunk and was really really sad at the party and saw her sitting by herself went to go get her and she sort of fell on me and she cried and she cried and she said this guy doesn't love her and she couldn't understand why and was sad was so saddened by the pain that she felt and was so angry that someone had made her feel that way and was okay um and didn't really know how much of that to attribute to the amount of drinks that she had um so we were in the bathroom you know said that girl think she just really really sad she didn't have that much to drink at all blah blah blah um and then nice student um was like okay let me just do some things just in case just to check if she okay and she said essentially that she was pretty unresponsive her eyes aren't dilating um so she was like let bring her to sit down so brought her to sat down and was like scared obviously 'cause didn't know what to do i've never been in this situation before um but yeah it was terrifying and she said get all your friends to take her to the er so scurried around the party looking for them and found them and said we have to take her to the er and they didn't know what was going on 'cause they couldn't hear me but just kept pulling them and pulling them until they got there said we have to go to the er um so we brought her to huhs and my big sib from abwha helped me and um this other nice lady that know um who sophomore think and it was helpful but we just sort of sat there and cried cried so much because was so scared for her was so sad for her she was so scared for her future in medical school and her parents how they would react when saw my friend my very best friend here um being so strong for her and just saying like it okay and sort of taking charge of just taking care of her and could feel when she was gonna break and heard her break um in the in the room at huhs um and couldn't go in there but wanted to be in there so badly to say that it was okay it was not her fault um but uh the girl who got drunk was really sad and upset that we brought her but um she really wasn't okay so that just something that i'm thinking about and i'm super stressed about um for the girl who sick but also for my friend that know is gonna take so much of this upon herself 'cause that what she does she just too good of person uh like just don't know like genuinely love her and i'm so scared for what she gonna do what she gonna do to herself with this situation i'm so so so tired can't even focus can't keep my eyes open can't track with my eyes couldn't write my paper i'm really sad and i'm really hurt by this guy hope things will get better don't know what the right decision is everyone telling me to get away from him but there something that pulling me back haven't slept enough i'd say for the past week and now it really getting me so need to sleep and um yeah just really tired miss my friends feel lonely but you know pretty long day today um last night just had to go to bed was feeling terrible but now i'm going to bed really really late um yeah not something wanna make habit of but i'm being productive like all day so don't really know what happening but either way it not gonna be habit tomorrow gonna be long day so have to wash my hair after class [inaudible] together and do homework but hopefully things will go well very grateful um for the day i've grown bit i've been really sad know i'm really sad um but like i'm interested in guy that i've been talking to for while after yesterday realized that um the guy that was like trying to pursue here um i'm just not his type so yeah that that i'm just feeling like when things happen they happen if they don't they don't but you know it is what it is at this point i'm just living life and waiting to see where things take me today was pretty interesting um got up went to class um yep went to both my classes did work during my second class for my first class and then [hung out] with my friends washed my hair for an event that had tonight for final club that was like pre-punch there was pregame and party that was really nice um like that group lot which is good really really good and it co-ed which really appreciate um yeah so was fine was happy can't even say i'm happy anymore have friend that looks happy and that acts happy but know inside i'm very sad um and so came back little earlier like 1130 the party ended at like 1000 maybe 930ish 950 maybe um yeah so the party wasn't out for very long and the party wasn't over but um yeah still had pretty good time saw my friends that love realized they're one of my best friends she was like just like really amazing she tells me about how much like of an impact they've had on her harvard experience and that like she doesn't know where she would be if weren't there um think it nice feel the same way thank god yeah she just like someone that constant for me that feel really close to and could just be honest with which is really really really nice now she like sister never had appreciate it lot appreciate her and admire her lot um let see yeah so she usually like says things like that when she drunk or little tipsy should say so that what happened there um and then got home to finish my expos paper and submitted it and then texted texted my friend excuse me um who have been speaking to yeah we have not been don't know i'm just sort of done with him guess but was okay do you still wanna talk or like whatever and he was like yes we were busy he has couple things to do um then put on lauryn hill because i've listened to these two songs use loops from her track factor then put it and started crying 'cause was listening to it because [inaudible] been in relationship that does not uh did not involve any like intimate aspect of or anything else like held to those standards and expected to be there and you know be as supportive and present all the time was like what if were his girlfriend but we didn't have the intimate part we didn't even have label so like barely had any apparently definitely did not kiss definitely didn't do anything past that and like no love you so like care for you like there was just no actual like the loving part of the relationship there so that been hurting me lot coming to that realization um and understanding why that hurt so much to let him go even though like hit him and he he mirrors my father who is abusive but yeah so now i'm just um growing ready to go to sleep ready to recover ready to be ready for tomorrow okay day today pretty relaxed um went to the mall to buy clothes for friday which is yardfest um because i'd be going on stage and just wanna look like presentable having serious issue focusing um had to put my phone away from where i'm sitting so could focus which is really really bad and is new thing for me um compared to high school so that that also have to take shower um but yeah mean feel like my mondays and tuesdays are very busy and then the rest of the week can sort of chill but shouldn't chill you know what mean so need to figure that out and just make sure i'm productive and do work um yeah tomorrow another busy day but we will get things done for sure and also need to get sleep because it showing everywhere like my skin my face my health i'm just tired and now that i've gotten like seven hours of sleep for two nights i'm still super tired and you can really really tell in my face um today started fine um yeah it started okay went to class busy but that fine just starting to become stronger and get over things that have been bothering me and then of course talked to this guy today that been really like who essentially really hurt me and has no idea or so would like see how he is the one that has hurt me and how i'm just reacting um but yeah just hate him hate him so much and he just like my father and don't know what to do don't wanna be don't even know if wanna be friends with him anyway he not good for me he not healthy for me and for some reason still want him to want me and to like me at least and know he doesn't and i'm just waiting for him to say it but he keeps saying he does and know he lying and he you know he recently said he doesn't think he likes me in like that way anymore which hurt so much because was right he liked the idea of me but he didn't like who actually was think showed him too much of myself just why just keep everything everything everything to myself but um yeah essentially he exemplifies everything that thought guys would [inaudible] into my life would just pry you open help you release all of you know your pain your vulnerabilities and then they just leave you out to dry just walk away from you they don't put you back together nothing and hate him for that hate him hate him for that because he too self-centered he too conceited he thinks he too perfect to have ever made mistake or to have ever hurt anyone or been in the wrong makes me angry but he also makes me so sad was so so so so sad today walked to the bridge and just sat there and cried and listened to lauryn hill ex-factor and cried cried cried then these guys came in this car and first kinda saw them stop so was like leaning on the ledge but like got off of it so they wouldn't think was gonna do anything 'cause wasn't going to and then like like heard this line again that lauryn has that she was like um essentially it like thought you would be there for me like you said you'd be there for me cry you said you'd cry for me that you would die for me or whatever and it just really hurt because it was so true he said he would be there he not and he never will be he never could be 'cause he can't see me and it just like what the heck just can't believe fell for it it is annoying but can only go up from here and have to have faith that other people are are better but yeah so cried then they wanted to make sure was okay and was and said thank you and [inaudible] and then god bless them and stuff and they drove off and made sure they drove off and then decided that it'd be good idea to take off my headphones and go home so went home and i'm coming to bed and i'm gonna sleep i'm really tired got hit in the head with an elbow yesterday and i'm feeling not very well feeling like i'm concussed which i've had like five or six or so know these symptoms so i'm just gonna go to bed really struggling with focusing um had decent conversation with someone um who has called me his best friend um which is good guess we have um don't know if we've healed but we've stopped fighting and yeah i'm just tired and can't focus but also miss my friends it only been like day but know they're having fun and doing great things without me but that okay just wanna go to sleep let see yeah got waffle today which is good went to whole bunch of meetings about vietnam police brutality that happened last night and cried lot also as political action chair bsa felt like wasn't doing enough and also can't quite relate um because this was an international black student and if my job is to elevate the voices of others then i've gotta keep my mouth shut so yeah all of that has been on my mind i'm just so tired and my body hurts my cramps really really hurt just want to be loved really want to be in relationship but nobody wants that don't even know if people like me and that hard but i'm dealing with it as we must all yeah that my week feel like yeah that it super tired today really need to go to bed um spoke with um the guy that really don't like but have been good friends with for most of this year um kinda felt normal when he spoke about you know me and other guys which think is healthy thing for us we're just like at least separating which is great he has yet to tell me about the girl he talking to but know which is interesting um let see saw some of my friends today and and that was just like don't know what you do with him like we've been telling you this since day one da da da da and was just sitting there like yeah yeah you're right like um sorry not i'm sorry but like hear you like yes you're right then after that friend left my other friend was like you know that was really shitty of him to do that and it not okay for him to rub it in your face um and he can't really um expand on how obvious or how easy that decision was to make because he wasn't the one in the situation and um that is really shitty of him and not really good friend and didn't really think about it that way or noticed it until she said something um and so it really good to have her she really really great friend actually and like i've only known her for like two months now but she she real she really really real and really appreciate that um like her lot so i'm happy that i've made friends and that someone out of my friend group um so personally call her and yeah so things are things are going okay guess and growing and like that so definitely have concussion hmm definitely felt it till today it very unproductive barely did any work with departments for an an elections one because wanted to be there too as my position as political action chair wanted to be there to figure out who i'm working with um and really just get the inside scoop on who these people are what their shortcomings are how get about that um also realized that this guy that talk about way too much but um that has would say damaged me lot this year has been problematic who still call my friend am really so scared of him am and i'm so scared that wasn't willing to say anything about the meeting about him and i'm i'm glad didn't because the four-roles policy didn't work um at bmf the process is people get their speeches you have time for questions and then you exit the room and people deliberate and they discuss you know experiences you've had with them and then like why do you think they're good candidate or not good candidate blah blah blah and people really said like he homophobic he terrible person to work with um he horrible person for this position and then somebody else said for any position and it like realized that that do that and he was running for inclusivity chair and he somebody who has hard time respecting women and really other marginalized people that aren't like him and um wasn't able to stand up for him and say yeah he means well but also wasn't able to say like that accurate because was afraid that it would be shared and was right it did get shared and i'm glad didn't say anything again that like that really bad that i'm willing to hold my tongue out of fear for someone who my age and has no power over me or shouldn't have power over me so my friend also gave me some really good insight and she said you know if you're gonna let him think you're his best friend and really be his friend in all this then you're gonna have to do better because just leaving after he lost and not saying anything and like not being there and supporting him and saying he has good intention or has you know goodwill um while we were deliberating like you're not being good friend you're not being that best friend and was like don't want to you know what mean and like knew that wouldn't have done it for like the people that actually consider my friend and it made me realize that i'm staying cordial with this person because i'm afraid of them not because want to be their friend so that was really eye-opening today was really interesting um it was kind of peaceful other than me not getting to class on time actually no did make it on time but it was late for me like to be early to class um ended was really wild night um black men forum elections were yesterday um four walls policy during the deliberation process fell through and people have been saying things [inaudible] has been said um there has been lot of thing there have been lot of things going around about someone who was friends with um considered pretty close guy friend i've been friends with for most of this year um and he was homophobic terrible for the position someone said terrible for any position at all um exclusive essentially not woke lot of bad things um then spoke to him little bit about it the night after the election and the night of the election he was fine and then today get got text [inaudible] from that night saying where are you and then like don't know 30 seconds minutes later he in my room and he goes you know just don't understand and he starts getting upset and he gets kinda loud he like bangs on the door the wall little bit was like moving around my room very um expressive with his hands but in the beginning he was sort of like i'm so angry and he like lifted his fist and they were balled and it it was reaction to something that had said that he didn't really like um asked him to close my door and he slammed it and it was just like it was really bad situation it was very very similar to that um of which my parents used to have um my mom was abused emotionally and physically and i've been seeing lot of signs of my dad in this guy for quite some time um but this was think was the final straw came into my space unannounced he did knock on the door but like at that point you don't say no he was already in technically in my room he just wasn't in my single so that was terrifying um came in unannounced yelling didn't wanna listen to me didn't like any of the answers had to say it was just very very very very uncool um and my friend came over after spoke to couple of other friends over facetime mostly just one friend over facetime and they were essentially like we've been telling you that he not good for you and was like already knew that but it-it hard when that the first person that finds value in you that was the first male that had ever found that knew found value in me and thought was worth something and important so it was hard to let him go but after this event like was so triggered like my roommate knocked on my door and got so scared that started to tear up like i'm afraid i'm scared asked to my roommates to lock my doors um so yeah it it went from pretty relaxed taking it easy because of the concussion to very very stressful but i'm okay now i'm okay super tired again um need to get to sleep and get rest this morning woke up was okay did my hair little bit of self-care um so unproductive today it not even funny it like really bad so need to make sure get on top of that and do really well with that the silly thing that i'm really worrying about right now but i'm just so tired and need to be getting sleep because of this concussion but it like impossible also the doctor didn't give me note so that fantastic but think he'll hmm don't know i'm just like so tired um saw my friends today sitting with the guy that said wouldn't talk to anymore um he was he was talking to my one friend about he perc about how he perceived as homophobic and how that friend is um he is gay so that was that was good for them to have think but yeah i'm just so tired can't focus not bad day today um not even remembering what my day was like it super busy day thursday so lots of classes back to back then stuff for the iop but um yeah excited for tomorrow friend is coming excited to see him and yeah just seemed to get lot of work done need to wake up kind of early but i'm also concussing need to be getting sleep so shouldn't be up right now but am but i'm going to bed now and yeah have to do like whole bunch of last-minute things tomorrow and put my calendar up today and realized how much stuff have due and how much haven't done which is crazy um but it will get done and know it will so i'm excited and it will happen um not terrible day today did not do as much work as would have liked to do um which is super unfortunate 'cause have lot of work to do later on um said good-bye to friend today that had um hooked up with and like attempted to have sex with but didn't work um and that was sad because told him that like wasn't really interested in him in terms of having relationship and felt really bad saying it but like was not able to get aroused um at all by him and so like when we were doing things it kind of hurt and couldn't say anything because felt bad and that not something wanna do either um so like that happened spoke and hung out with an upperclassman um today my big sib which was good we connected um as much as we say you know like we're like the same person she really unhappy um and she really not confident in herself and that not something that wanna continue guess so been hearing that today was like okay need to change what i'm doing because as successful as she is don't wanna be as unhappy as she is so that was really interesting to see was super busy day just going from like meeting to meeting and then to the event and yeah so now i'm home we need to go to bed 'cause have to wake up early have not been getting sleep but yeah hmm definitely won't be able to go to party tomorrow so have to send text to cancel that as well but yeah that about it i'm super super tired today was really hard for me to get through because was so tired from getting essentially no sleep last night so really wanna catch up on that have two thing two big things due wednesday so need to get those done um yeah just have been thinking about how much like [redacted] someone there um as in significant other and don't know if want relationship or just hookup um but like feel like have needs and don't know what to do with them um i'm nervous about this summer 'cause i'm going to peru but that'll be fine and yeah i'm just so so so tired and getting through today was really hard because of that um like yeah also my friend is really struggling with what happened this weekend her ex visiting her um and it like for people that get close with sometimes feel like can feel their emotions just like can feel when they're stressed you know what mean that how my mom is with her brother and her couple close friends she has that she grew up with and considers family and sisters um and like feel that with her and like knew like since yesterday that she was not having good day um she sent me nice message saying that like she knew was worried but that she okay which would like to believe and don't completely but will give her her space and that hard just wanna be there for her and just like support her in way that she doesn't really let me but need to be okay with the way she operates so um think from this point on won't be asking that much i'll just leave her to tell me and try not to get upset when hear from other people that also something that happening was like i'm not jealous of her other friends just wish could be someone she could confide in comfortably as she does with so many other people but that okay yeah then uh i'm just ready to go to bed um today was not busy but did get little stressed when saw um someone that haven't been talking to for quite some time and or what feels like long time and it was hard to sit in the same room as him for an hour an hour and half and just act like we didn't know each other or anything or that we hadn't spent the whole semester and half spending lot of time together so that was something that really put damper on my mood for the rest of the day um and did homework with friends to try to get my mind off of that went to go for walk but stopped myself halfway and came back to campus and yeah just have i'm like really stressed about paper but have like other social issues think that are distracting me unfortunately but need to get this draft done by tomorrow so can go to this pre-punch and yeah hoping tomorrow can be super super productive um long day today really tired was supposed to go to pre-punch event tonight didn't go um just wrote an essay all day handed in the rough draft it it pretty rough know how to redo lot but we'll see where it goes feel really really fat so need to figure out what to do about that it something concerning me for some reason but yeah so gonna figure out lot of things but um yeah just really need to get studying and finish these papers and it gonna be real grind for the next couple of days and wanna make sure that stay on top of that hopefully that goes well that really all i'm thinking about now but today it was good did most of my homework with friends um and that was productive actually but um yeah little bit of challenge have some conversation with friends about getting with guys and sleeping with them and that was interesting because for while though was like yeah guess want that but and realized like think want something lot more intimate and um long-lasting guess so that was cool but yeah um pretty good day today not as productive as would have liked to be finally finished an econ chapter that was due probably weeks ago but you know it it it it got done somewhat to certain extent um also had formal tonight which stayed for about 50 minutes just to support the group that i'm part of that is performing and that was interesting i'm feeling very very like anti-social which is fantastic except don't do things um about it which is good which is not good and um yeah it was just like really interesting to see like all those people and had absolutely no interest in saying hi to single person um and yeah that like new for me um i'm super tired my body is telling me to sleep and keep pushing but that okay it not okay and yeah that about it it was pretty chill day the weather was nice so sat outside and pretended to do homework and that was good um today wasn't bad my friend slept over and spent lot of time with her today which was interesting um she'd mentioned to me that she the type of person that has one friend she really close to think i'm becoming that person don't know how feel because really do love being alone um and think i'm most productive there but also don't know how to say no and also don't want her to think that don't want to be her friend um so that something that i've been struggling with internally but haven't said anything about um and then today went to like movie screening with couple of people um and there were only like 10 to 15 people there the movie was awful um but sat there and everybody there was black and felt so left out like didn't know anyone knew some people but not upperclassmen and felt like when did say things they were just like what is she doing like what does she who is she you know and that hard it really hard um yeah and like all my friends are fine and close with them so that was unfortunate but um yeah and then one this was in the quad so on the shuttle back um one of the upperclassmen were with us and she started crying think something was happening with her um and was going back to the [yard] with one of my friends one of the closest friends have here and she sitting across from me and she [tends] text um that says think i'm gonna stay with um the upperclassman-person name um to see if she okay and started to type like okay yeah or like something longer and then all of sudden just deleted it all wrote which we know for each other is not really good sign um and thankfully seconds after sent that we'd arrived at the [yard] and you know said bye to the upperclassman you know tried to show my condolences and left bolted out and then look back and see that uh my friend and the other um girl that i'm close with uh both left and the upperclassman went home by herself um and just started walking really fast because there was so much adrenaline mean there was so much energy in me and was just like can't be here right now need to go for walk and couldn't really figure out what was going on and i'm still not quite sure what was going on but was so angry and it was like uh know need to cry and have needed to cry for long time but they won't come out and don't know what going on but wanted to cry so badly and went to the bridge and just looked at the water and like my eyes would water little bit but not enough it was just really frustrating and they started calling my name and they were like where are you going was like going for walk and just kept walking and then the girl i'm closest with texted me and said what wrong um said everything fine and then she sent text okay so you your emotions and your actions take 180 all of sudden and you're totally different and you walk away sure okay um so she was right was upset but didn't say anything and just don't know why i'm upset and this is something that has happened before where do get really really angry or sad and have no idea why but my body shows it and my heart shows it so need to figure that out asap but yeah that what been on my mind and stressing me along with homework and studying um pretty good day today actually it was reminiscing day today had meeting for [redacted] didn't do that well in it um but know what need to do to fix it which is pretty good it makes me feel comfortable um it was an amazing day in terms of weather so sat outside and just enjoyed it so much sat with friends don't usually sit with which was really cool um it was just fun like genuinely just like fun day fun experience and yeah and this guy that i'm interested in um came and sat down with me for while and just like we didn't talk really he just like sat he sat like sort of behind me next to me and just sort of like leaned back on him and then did his hair later on and did such bad job and knew was gonna do terrible job and tried to tell him and he was like no that fine um and was really really really embarrassed um and it was also like silent there which really reminds me of how awkward am and how little social skills have so that something that wanna work on but yeah so that really what was my biggest stress today other than like not being as productive as need to be when am doing work do feel like i'm making progress which is really good um really wanna get this [ex post] paper done yeah 'cause only have week left to do it but um yeah huh interesting let me get my calendar now really need to get cracking on my papers but yeah so wanna be more productive and but today was like pretty nice but it ended sort of crappy terrible parties and my closest friend here sort of seem like she was upset with me but think she was upset with something else um and yesterday like sort of left her abruptly off of the shuttle and just was like need to go off for walk and she texts me asking what was wrong and said nothing and she was like oh like you have this 180-degree turn in um just like emotions and like presence really and you're saying nothing wrong and essentially was like yeah i'm fine um and think today when she sort of did that to me it was like little bit of payback and so i'm like i'm not upset but [paid] for it 'cause get it 'cause ask her to share things with me and then don't share things with her um but there also this part um where feel like need to be more comfortable with her not sharing things with me um because i'm not the only person in the world who [inaudible] and think part of it is just that like genuinely care about her too but so just did but like not [good] you know so that something that think i'm gonna work on lot and think that will alleviate lot of the stresses that we have just because we're like so close and we genuinely care about each other so much so like it hard when we don't feel like what we're giving to each other is being reciprocated but um yeah and also the stresses today were just social things but at the end of the day would say it was an overall positive day today was really nice um relaxed did most of my all of my homework by myself spent most of the day by myself saw my dad hung out with him for bit which was good um but yeah kinda like being by myself so i'm gonna do that more often know it the end of the semester it not really the time to do that but that what feels right so that what i'm gonna do um yeah and things will happen the way they will [inaudible] coming out tomorrow night and the night after don't think i'll be going to both but i'm not quite sure yet um yeah got little stressed by one of my close friends today she kinda was rude to me yesterday but just let it go because know how she deals with emotions when she stressed don't think she meant it negatively but whatever um yeah then today didn't speak to her didn't see her at all um and she said she doesn't think she gonna go to the football anymore and she was my plus one so that that was exciting um didn't respond to that also messaged her friend after they messaged me and uh questioned photo that posted um because the girl that was on the photo i'm not really friends with but she in our blocking group people don't really like her and you know kinda found myself guess defending myself and saying that like no we're not friends just wanted to post the picture and then feel stupid and so told her sort of how really felt about like how our group is so factioned and are so easy to judge other people for hanging out with others but we don't even hang out together as whole we don't use the group chat anymore nobody reaches out to people me and one other person in the group feel super left out and ostracized all the time but was like we've done nothing wrong if anything we've been the most forgiving of the entire group so it like don't know maybe little worried about next semester when we're all actually living together but it is what it is we'll figure it out things will work out have faith it just really annoying 'cause don't wanna have these conversations at all um not terrible day today um sorry this is so late [inaudible] [inaudible] o'clock in the morning but um yeah today wasn't bad uh did work went to lunch saw some friends had discussion with one friend about the stresses he having over blocking group and how no one is reaching out to him then he stopped reaching out to others and that he sort of drifting away um spoke to one of my block mates also about how sort of felt left out and how like working on individual friendships within our group is important um that when people don't have any ties to strengthen um it really hard to stay happy and part of the group um there was also freshman formal that was tonight uh yeah i'm finding myself trying to impressive this guy that like but just like make sure he sees me that annoying and don't really like seeing myself do that so i'm gonna try to not do that anymore um but yeah i'm so tired so tired um today was pretty awful um struggled lot with friends block of group people ignoring our existence excuse me people in the group ignoring other people existence distancing themselves from specific people not being forward not reaching out has all materialized into this [sculpture] not [sculpture] excuse me into this don't know this jungle gym obstacles um and it very very frustrating because feel like did nothing wrong but also can't ask um i'm supposed to be having meeting with one of my friends tomorrow and yeah so actually all these relationships are breaking apart and we're supposed to go together next semester it so gonna be so so so rough but yeah that really that all in my mind right now pretty rough day today um lot of social stresses just with [inaudible] group um lots and lots and lots of tension there not much can do about it essentially i'm am being selfish and just getting bothered by the fact that my friends don't really speak to me when they're having issues um and yeah so that that is me being selfish need to fix that but also wish i'd said more in the conversation about this being two-way street it is tough but don't know at the end of the day they needed to be [inaudible] start talking to them think for thi the rest of the semester and like not because i'm mad at them or anything just because like i'm tired of focusing on that and don't want to so i'm not going to anymore uh yeah so that that and that always gonna be now well we'll take it from there next semester today wasn't terrible sat outside hung out with friend friend that don't usually hang out with which was cool um you know got over whatever going on with my blocking group which is good um so yeah so that was well things are little rocky with guy was really interested in and really liked um but my friend sort of reassured me that this probably isn't uh i'm not interested it more of this isn't the right time which guess is positive but still disappointing um and then yeah my mom graduating tomorrow should be in bed have to wake up early um so i'm really happy for her and excited for her just wanna be there for her so hopefully that goes well and yeah i'm just living not being as productive as need to be for sure oh no way um and it gonna bite me in the buttock but we're getting there i'm also really really not liking my body right now i'm super out of shape but yeah today it was really great got to see my mom graduate from graduate school at northeastern and that was awesome hung out with her and my dad and some close family friends which was really exciting um i'm just very very proud of her and this is like new point in our relationship think we're like i'm proud of her as fellow adult and not just as like mom child sort of thing um but like really do admire her and think she pushes me along in this um sort of inspired me to like get back on the grind and like realize that i'm student too and that need to go places and do things so that was really good for me um didn't speak to that many friends today other than people saying congratulations um in response to my snapchat story or instagram story or whatnot but we went to dinner um sat there at the graduation it was only like total of like four or five of us so it was very small group um and yeah felt fine now feel like i'm gonna vomit so going to sleep is gonna be hard but wanted to finish that essay and have to wake up early tomorrow but since the essay is not finished i'll be waking up earlier tomorrow to do it to like ni 1030 meeting so we'll see what happens mean yeah don't know i'm just like disappointed that it not done with but know it'll be okay pretty good day today um spent lot of time with people

thankful for um and like tried to speak to me about it little bit and did share that [inaudible] was just frustrated with couple of things that he said um and that was just really tired as well and also like just from moving from college to home it very interesting experience coming back to some place that not like really your home but you're still treated like child even though you're told to be an adult in for like nine months so like was dealing with that stress and think what he did just sort of was the last straw um and so felt bad and apologized but just don't really have lot of tolerance today um am so horny and i've been thinking about this guy uh for like way too long um and know he like not thinking about me which is annoying um but like this is the guy that like kind of lied and cuddled with for like two or three hours and kissed and just like hung out which was cool listen to music but ugh it frustrating 'cause like any time think about something it of him like

tomorrow today was very chill day dropped my mom off at work then went um back home to get ready and basically went on walk for about three or four hours um on the east side which is nice part of rhode island and that was relaxing picked up some things um listened to my mom talk lot about me losing weight working on myself [inaudible] within myself being confident of myself eating right heard lot of uh lectures about eating and decisions and thought processes in regards to those things and that gotten little frustrating but i'm working on dealing with it um yeah am starting to realize that like don't wanna be around any people at all like want to be by myself want to be alone and just wanna sleep as well um so that been very interesting experience 'cause always defined myself as people person but don't want to see or talk to anyone want to be by myself and that it which is don't know what the purpose of that is don't know why that happening um but we'll see yeah um today was okay was by myself for most of the day which was nice worked out went for walk wasn't very productive i'm worried about the internship that have coming up don't even know what questions to ask but really need to sit down and think and do it um so that may be something that do on the train tomorrow also worried about my internship in peru haven't heard anything from them um which is quite frustrating and am i'm little nervous about it but of course my parents are even more nervous about it um which is unfortunate but i'm hoping to hear from them soon yeah those are really the only two things that i've been thinking about um so we'll see what happens with that yeah my mom has been really really really pushing me eating healthy eating less we're always having food talks always always always always talking about food and how to eat less and how bad it is for you and this and that it like it gets annoying and think she doesn't even want me to take photos of food she doesn't want me to use like words that are food like say like would use chimichanga as like filler when don't know how to finish my sentence or whatever she was like you should stop doing that people are gonna get the wrong idea about you which i'm assuming is that like to eat which is true but um whatever guess that'll change know it that she means it in the best way but it like it it annoying and it not that she shaming me but don't like it and don't really appreciate it and don't think that driving me away from eating um is the same as instilling fear of food and like complete like diet essentially from food and when say diet mean like not talking about food not taking pictures of food not like like none of that like don't think that good thing think it creates this fear it sort of breeds this this hypersensitivity to food and how bad it can be for you when at the end of the day you need it you know what mean but know she means well pretty okay day um fell asleep for sec which is why this is kind of late um yeah went to austin did stuff for my trip to peru just prepared for that with immunizations and forms um so yeah then just hung out with my dad which was frustrating at times 'cause don't really get or really enjoy his sense of humor and um sometimes things can get really frustrating with him but things went well until the last minute where got frustrated after he left which was weird but was really bothered by it um yeah then was just very horny so masturbated was pretty okay um yeah feeling sickly and cough coming so trying to get rid of that with tea it not really working but yeah hopefully tomorrow we're protective did what wanted to do today for one of my internships so that was good to get out of the way but yeah um today was pretty relaxed had um had conversation with my mom woke up to messages um as in text messages as well as instagram messages about weight loss losing the freshman 15 um those all came from my mom which was you know not exactly what wanted to wake up to but know she means well after that we went for walk um we got back and went to the gym and uh yeah then we relaxed um ate dinner went to get things and then came back and continued uh unpacking from college um i'm leaving in two weeks so it kind of weird to unpack to know that i'll have to pack again in about week and half um but i'm letting things happen am feeling better about my body and that i'm working out more um and i'm little stressed about how i'm going to keep up throughout the year [inaudible] like if have time to be in relationship as wanted to for so long um but i'm just like putting lot of faith in god and i'm also trying to make sure that stay or become more religious this year um and so figuring out how to do that and you know wanting to do it for myself um as well as for those around me you know just to be well versed in it when need it but also maybe when friends need it and just to you know feel confident in in something you know what mean to say that adamantly believe in something and i've no question about that is something that wanna be able to say so i'm looking forward to that next year i'm really just thinking about next year looking forward to it and i've also been struggling with what want as career as much as wanna have social impact and through policy and things like that also don't wanna be living in box and that means may have to go towards consulting um who really knows but we'll see today was interesting woke up was kind of on the go was supposed to meet my dad for movie up in boston live in rhode island so it an hour hour and half um traveled to watch movie with him to see deadpool um wake woke up was rushed as usual for things like that um and saw friend from high school at starbucks on the way had really nice conversation with her and caught up um so we're planning to catch up some more am let see then we ended up getting to boston um things were tense between my parents which is something um normal and uh they just got toge progressively got worse um now my dad is little weird with me but think he just upset with the situation and not me so i'm not really gonna take any of it to heart um which is growth for me which is good um let see the movie was fine really was kind of unbothered by the situation between my parents because it just normal that like what i'm used to um it almost bothers me when they do get along because feel like it fake um let see yeah mean sort of had this lingering feeling over my head that like i'm doing lot of things wrong and don't know and that my mom was gonna explode at me pretty soon but don't know what i'm doing wrong so i'm not sure what to stop but just feel it happening soon and that makes me nervous and 'cause in two weeks i'm leaving for peru that gonna be very stressful she probably gonna be mad that didn't do things that don't even know um earlier and she also gonna be sad that i'm leaving it'll be easier for me to leave if she mad at me it'll be easier for her to let go so don't know but yeah that really all that happened today yeah pretty relaxing day today um you know just did my usual went to the gym took shower ate breakfast went to starbucks um have been really thinking about what i'm eating and putting in my body very food conscious right now as result of my mom um nervous about my internship both of them nervous about traveling this summer um but think i'm excited feeling more comfortable with my body now that i'm working out i'm trying to appreciate my physical appearance um i'm making sure that stay focused on my goals and part of that is figuring out what wanna do what wanna be um and that has been something that i've been thinking about um in terms of my social interactions today it been really been mostly myself and then once my mom got out of work just hanging out with her um yeah we went to eat at restaurant then got ice cream um so not bad mean subject to discussions about food eating well eating healthy exercising it basically all we talk about gets frustrating but think it more for her than for me um so now i'm just getting used to it but also focusing on me so yeah day was really good today um got good workout and went to get waxed spent most of the day by myself my mom came uh read little bit while she worked out at the gym and then went to friend house and just gave her um some hand-me-downs and also um just got to catch up with her which was really awesome um yeah really good to hear from her i'm really glad saw her and let see yeah other than that just been texting more people than usual but it about it and yeah it was pretty relaxed day nothing nothing crazy long day today uh got out of bed got ready as usual to the gym today won't be gymming tomorrow um so that not great but um yeah got on the train to come to [redacted] i'm staying at my dad house for doctor appointment have tomorrow morning um didn't feel that ate as well today as have been also when got here was just really frustrated very irritable um met up with my dad after he didn't respond to text messages calls um so when did see him wasn't very enthusiastic at all and like he bought me lunch and still just kinda wasn't having it and it was almost like couldn't control um my reactions you know anything at all and uh tho like didn't feel bad but was conscious of it happening and like just couldn't fix it and that was that was interesting to see and to hear um eventually did get better met up with my cousin um went out to get some ramen which was good and then walked her home and then went to bar to watch the game um where had some sweet potato fries should not have so had ginger ale should not have had that either but it all right so yeah now feel like my stomach is big i'm trying to go to the beach on friday and wanna look good wanna feel good so we'll see what happens today was great day went to the beach with lot of my friends from high school that was great experience um caught up with lot of them and was updated on their lives and yeah it was just really awesome to hear from them [inaudible] community in this uh community that love so much um so i'm excited and hope to keep these relationships strong because they're so amazing and the people are just then they know me more than know myself [inaudible] um so yeah that was really really great all day we went to the beach um and then went to one of their houses and uh watched movie but yeah now i'm home and reminded of all the things that have to do i'm leaving for peru in week that really scary but it gotta happen so yeah am excited um but nervous but really need to go to the to bed because didn't gym for the past like two or three days and that was really bad so need to go really hard tomorrow and wake up at like 800 so yep pretty long day today went to bed really late last night woke up early to go to the gym and then hang out with my mom all day that was fun that was nice hit some bumps but did pretty well ate pretty healthily today i'm realizing that there are points in the day where i'm just like tired and done with socializing um and just kind of like clock out and turn off and shut down so that not great but hopefully that gets better i'm so nervous for peru um which is happening in week like don't want to go uh yeah so that really terrifying but hopefully that gets better uh yeah that really all that on my mind just getting ready and today was kind of hard um and not sleeping well at all so that really difficult for me um also didn't work out today so got really frustrated um which has been happening lot was just like all of sudden be in mood and have no tolerance for people who don't wanna talk to people don't wanna hear people don't even wanna be in the same room as other people um that pretty bad and i'm not sure what causing that think i've really been looking towards alone time and sometimes just really really need it and when can't get it get frustrated but i'm not quite sure what the root of those mood swings are and i'm not on my period either but that has definitely been happening lot while home not sleeping well while home um not being very productive while home it very interesting but have been working lot on my self-image self-confidence and things like that i'm really nervous for this trip in peru that may be why i'm not sleeping um but i'm also looking forward to it so i'll see what happens think just have to be lot more positive about my future and really get my goals in line and then things will happen the way they need to from there i'm just trusting god uh so yeah that really all that been on my mind today just being incredibly frustrated with people and then looking forward to peru today was really nice day um woke up didn't get to go to the gym but did have the opportunity to spend time with my mom and walk around um [the outlet] then got to see all of my high school friends which was absolutely incredible um they even got me sundae for my birthday um for which i'll be in peru um so that was it was really awesome to see them and just got to connect with them and think um when i'm with them remember the person am and the person that i've grown to be proud of um and so love that feeling um but also love their honesty and that uh conversation had today with one of my friends um involved us talking about you know being in two separate worlds and she said do you ever feel like you're in two separate places and you're not even sure if you know yourself in either and just felt that and that resonated with me so much and it was refreshing um i'm not sure have friends like that right now that say that to me usually i'm the one to say that to other people um so just really missed that and sort of um regretted not really staying in touch throughout the school year but don't think it was very big deal but wanna make sure that you know do stay in touch so was really really happy to see all my friends today pretty good day today got in really good workout um and then [inaudible] did some work for my second internship which the lady is kind of not being the best about uh my boss person human being thing um i'm glad to have that over with and yeah i'm just really getting excited for [inaudible] which is also still finding myself thinking about relationships lot and guys and how much want one um as in relationship admit think need to sort of pivot that thinking into what meant to be will be and need to be student and whatever that allows me to do is what will do um so thinking about that yeah but was really happy to see friends um or talk to friends um yeah that about it pretty pretty slow day but type of day that i've been looking forward to for quite sometime um so today started out pretty peaceful didn't get to work out um but did run some errands um after my dentist appointment so that was cool it nice having car and being able to do those things uh later went to boston um to have dinner with my dad that was stressful experience frustrating experience which unfortunately is something usual um and yeah so that was just not fun not great end to my day but came home to [inaudible] cat and uh my mom who we've been going pretty strong in our relationship um i'm wondering why my dad is kind of acting out right before leave but once again think this is just him making it easier for himself um and being more okay with the idea of me leaving for two months but whatever i'm getting more and more excited for peru it starting to feel real now which is good 'cause it happening um hope things go well and need to start packing need to start packing but yeah think my cat knows that i'm leaving so he been pretty touchy which is frustrating but you know he trying he trying um but yeah getting lot of books focusing on self-love uh which is big and yeah i'm excited i'm really excited for this trip think lot is going to happen for me
