17,okay so today felt pretty sick um i'm going to concede to the opinions of my friends and say that was drunk on thursday night so woke up on friday morning um like kind of hungover like my head hurt really bad and just felt weird and funny and my throat really hurt and was also losing my voice today don't think it don't sound as bad anymore so hopefully i'm not really losing it but um so felt terrible got up went to section barely listened not that there was much to listen to and spent uh large oh and after went to section so my section was from like 1100 am to 1200 pm so woke up woke up showered ate bag of potato chips for breakfast went to section and then came back to my dorm room and slept for three hours because got terrible night sleep last night fell asleep at 200 am woke up at 400 am for no fucking reason and then couldn't fall back asleep until like past 630 like watched the sun rise from my bed and it it it it made me angry and then fell back asleep like at 630 and slept to like 900 so was super tired um uh but um so like didn't feel that great today but did spend lot of time with one of my roommates um she roommates that don't usually see that much because usually she gone lot uh but she went to breakfast with me my breakfast being bag of potato chips that bought in vending machine from library and after section after my nap actually we went to dinner together and we went to the library together and did not do any studying at the library she was being productive was on my phone the whole time doing literally nothing really just didn't feel like motivated to do anything today and think it because of how not good felt at the beginning of the day it just like set up my whole day for failure um but yeah but it not like had to do anything really because do most of my homework so far in advance that i'm never really behind can afford to miss day and um was going to go to party tonight with friends but decided to skip it so that could be reasonable and productive human being because have no impulse control and know that if went to another party would get just as drunk or more drunk would get as drunk as possible basically that how roll um so that would not be good for my life tomorrow and can afford to miss one day of homework but cannot afford to miss two um uh but um another thing today so yeah did not feel good today but another thing that was good today is that me and my friends from back home um skyped we was on skype for three hou well we was like talking on skype for one hours and then me and one of my friends who did not leave she didn't have anywhere to like two of them had to leave for school-related thing but the other one who didn't have to leave we um like shared screens on skype and um and watched netflix together for like two more hours and just love my friends very much and miss them and love them very much so that was really really nice so even though like wasn't really um that productive and felt kind of sick this morning would say it was still good day like still um enjoyed it or still enjoy uh guess now i'm ha now i'm in good mood because don't feel sick anymore and facetimed my friends but it still good day every day is good day as long as you're alive at some point felt was going to die from alcohol poisoning and that didn't happen so it great day

42,okay so last oh i'm losing my voice last night went to bed at like 1130 pm so woke up super well-rested today it was really great not great woke up without voice that unfortunate um i'm still kind of losing my voice but hopefully if just drink enough wattle water that'll stop happening um so yeah what else was gonna say um [laughter] yeah um went to class have two class today in between that two class went to the lab for this to get new watch and then ate lunch with friends socialized um that was nice actually ate lunch today so that was good um and then after my second class came back took nap was actually had like headache this morning like all through this morning and early afternoon had headache then was sleepy even though wo got lot of sleep so came back and took nap and then after that felt better so it was great and then after that did like just prepped for debate for the rest of the evening and then did tiny bit of studying for linguistics but besides that just prepped for debate um so yeah prepping for debate could've gone better like did it kinda really slowly and kept like getting distracted taking breaks but like that okay it not till friday anyway who cares [so then] can do it on like thursday night what day is it tuesday the only thing that i'm even slight i'm not really stressed at all but the only thing that i'm even slightly worried about is the fact that have my midterm next tuesday and feel like haven't studied for it really and um i'm also gonna be gone all weekend 'cause of debate and don't know when my french midterm is [at all like] at all and also my midterm it not on tuesday it on monday so that great um yeah but i'm sure i'll be fine think the class is like pretty easy understand [it pretty well] just need to like re go over my notes and maybe maybe go over the powerpoints then should be pretty fine um so yeah that it um good night um well i'm not going to bed yet i'm gonna go prep for debate for like maybe like half an hour more and then i'm gonna go to sleep um so yeah good night in half an hour 
43,okay so today my voice sounds rude today woke up had class went to class enjoy my class we watched movie in linguistics today oh that looks weird um after linguistics went to some office hours then went back to my dorm and laid in bed no no no no didn't that lie went to lunch met up with some friends um yeah ate lunch figured out how to get into the dining hall when it outside of lunch hours [inaudible] which is secret that just did not know um um and then went back to my dorm and was like i'm gonna prep for debate and then just laid in bed and read the news for some hours and half before going to my next class which was also interesting [inaudible] talked about us or big project that we're doing like next month and how need to get like grip on reality and need to like start working or like not start working but like start thinking of better plan um and then after that class went back to my dorm meant to prep for debate instead got emailed the thing about the study abroad that applied for um so was like filling out more of that thing um applying for more scholarships really need to find way to pay for this crap um and then yeah then went to work had work and then after work also went to like the dea the freshman dean house for like dinner because it was holding like dinner thing that was fun and then after went to um work and then after work went to um debate practice round which was lot of fun love the people in debate like feel like love the people in debate more than love debate like if it was actual people that didn't love would just hate it completely but because love the people in it love it um and then after the debate went to the dining hall to get more food specifically cake and now i'm back in my room just finished my french homework am like i'm not behind in any homework because i'm never behind in homework because of who am as people but feel like am significantly more behind in homework than would be if was not so focused on debate do debate in all of my free time now instead of working harder on my homework um which is like kinda not good because have like midterms but like also c'est la vie um and think it all it gonna be fine um next week will not be going to debate tournament so think i'm just going to next week work super far ahead for all of my class so that can hopefully um like just like like in the upcoming in the second half of the semester in general be so far ahead that don't have to be as worried as am i'm still not really very worried because just don't worry in general really usually but like mean like it would be nice to know that don't need to like stay up late to finish my homework ever because it already done two week in advance which is what it usually is um so yeah that [inaudible] that was just like us rambling my own thoughts out loud this is really like some audio diary um also i'm losing my voice kind of which makes us little nervous for debate um but yeah my whole life is just centered around debate right now good night

119,okay so today had like like actually like mildly productive day um it started off not that way actually um have been worried because i'm scared that being here might like sink into depressive spiral and could feel it happening today when um had list in my head of all the things that could do or like should do instead decided to lay on the ground and stare at the ceiling literally didn't even go on my phone for while just stared at the ceiling um but that okay um eventually convinced myself to get up started filling out study abroad application just have to write like little short essay left and then turn that in and should be all set um and um started unpacking the boxes in my room um my mom moved to new house this summer while was at well after had left for school so i'd never like seen my room or unpacked my room so just started unpacking really the only things brought was like books brought some sentimental things too but not many um yeah so that was that two things was the two productive things did did not start them until like 800 pm but and before that was just like watching youtube listening to music laying on the ground and slowly sinking into depressive spiral but hopefully this bout of productivity have raised me out of this the depressive spiral mean i'm not here for long so can't really get into it right it won't happen also think what helped drag me out of it was well was was also like preparing for my study abroad trip that i'm going on um like think i'm leaving on monday or tuesday for it and so was reading about it and was getting excited again and actually should probably check what day we're meeting and what time because that would be smart um so yeah anyway life is good i'm very very excited it i've not done the things that like set out to do over this short winter break that have like the goals it set up but it don't really matter like who cares like i'm gonna die anyway there always time to do them later goodnight

138,okay so today had good day we had our second day at [redacted] actually like woke up before our alarm today which was shocking um but yeah um we today we like had breakfast at our hotel and then we walked around [redacted] and went to another museum which was nice and we went to the do like the park which had whole bunch of dogs which was super cute we had couscous for uh lunch which is um like mediterranean or moroccan dish or well it depends on what country anyway it like mediterranean dish or something which apparently french people eat lot don't really like it mean it like okay it don't taste bad but don't think would ever eat it like our free own free will it was just odd to me anyway um yeah then we came back to uh paris so am now back in paris worked on our essay for little bit um didn't get super far though but i'm definitely like farther than was at this point when it came to the last essay but still might have to stay up really late to finish it don't know i'll see hopefully don't um but anyway i'm going to go to bed now because wanna wake up early because i'm gonna try to go to the top of the [redacted] tomorrow even though i'm scared of heights good night see you later 
139,okay so had pretty um chill day today had whole plan that wanted to do today that didn't get all done like one of the things was wanted to go to the top of the eiffel tower but it was actually um storming really bad so couldn't go but went to the top of the arc de triomph which was really really nice like had one [inaudible] whole pizza for lunch and then visited two cemeteries in [redacted] um wanted to visit three actually wanted to do like visit three and then go to the maison de balzac but um it started raining really hard and was walking around and wasn't dressed properly for the weather so was really cold so decided to just come back and laid down in my bed and chilled um and now it 300 am i've just finished my essay that due today because procrastinated again because i'm literally stupid and now i'm going to go to sleep um yeah besides the like procrastinating and the fact that i'm going to get like four and half hours of sleep because procrastinated i'd say life is pretty good and now i'm going to bed good night 
140,okay so today was good day actually um skipped class today because just like um stayed up late and finished my essay and then just was not feeling like you know like going to class like waking up early considering what time went to sleep to go to class so decided at like 700 no decided at like almost 800 am was like you know what i'm going back to sleep and don't care and at first was like maybe i'll just show up to class like an hour late like when they start the [tour] but then just ended up not going period um think my after that went and walked around um walked like for pretty long time along like the river went to this place called [la gallette] which was really nice [and cute] and they was like park thing um yeah and went to an guy house to you know like have sex they was good and was there for like four hour and then came back watched youtube for an hour and now they is time for me to go to sleep because can't skip class tomorrow because i'm pretty sure have quiz coming up so all in all mean good day i'm happy and i'm sleepy now good night 
141,procrastinate too much procrastinating is probably um going to ruin my life like right now am um finishing studying for the quiz that have tomorrow morning in less than eight hours to be exact like why do do this to myself like there no reason for this anyway um had very lazy day today after class went to the institute in [mondel] club and like went to the ninth floor looked around um and like to like look at the city and went back here to where i'm staying and just laid in my bed for like literally forever and watched bunch of netflix and that was it like why am like this don't know sorry i'm distracted i'm like trying to finish this so that can go to bed um anyway um yeah i'm going to go to bed now mean had good day even though did nothing i'm going right at it tomorrow than did nothing mean mean like procrastinated but enjoy watching netflix so what wrong with that anyway goodnight

146,okay so today had really good day think i'm just really really really really happy to be back happy just okay be be back so anyway um today was the beginning of [inaudible] to class today had went to two class one was french one was um linguistics was originally planning to take five class this semester but i've changed my mind think the reason wanted to do five class was because of um was gonna take asl this semester too and didn't wanna take like didn't wanna have half my class be language class and one be [expo] so was gonna take five but decided not to take asl so don't need to take five class so i'm just gonna wait so think i'm gonna take french sign language um [expos] and my freshman seminar and part of the reason that decided to not take four class is 'cause now my schedule will be really like empty and just like like sleeping in like being chill wanna good life you know um anyway and um yeah spent lot of time with people today woke up late um or not late but woke up later than usual because didn't have 'cause have class late now like my earliest class is 1100 now um had like got late lunch went to class went to both my class and then um went um to like the dining hall think um and sat in the dining hall with friends for long time and went to debate meeting then went to um study break for my entryway and it was all fun and good and chill and yeah that like it that and now i'm going to sleep um it is only midnight but i'm feeling super tired um kinda accidentally woke up early for some reason this morning maybe that why um yeah and i'm really excited didn't finish my french homework but i'm gonna finish it tomorrow because since i've decided to only take four class don't actually have to go to any class tomorrow and yeah so goodbye good night sleep tight don't let the bed bugs bite bye 
147,okay so i'm very tired so i'm gonna try to make this as fast as can um had good day today um i've decided that i'm only gonna take four classes instead of fi-five and the real determining factor in my decision was that didn't want to get up to go to classes today and because there no expos this week if only take four classes don't have to go to classes monday or tuesday thursday or friday this week so so didn't didn't take fifth classes so didn't have to do anything today just chilled this morning after french and spanish then got my watch switched then went to work and came back and did my french homework for long time spent some time with like friends like at meals which was nice and now it is late i'm going to bed had very good day i'm just um i'm still like just really super happy to be back to school doubt that that going to change um just really missed it feel much better being at school um and feel like it more home than like you know my actual mother house or whatever um so yeah i'm really sleepy i'm going to bed now good night 
148,okay so i've been having like very very good past week not only am like very happy to be back at school and to see my friends um but like haven't had that many things to do with classes haven't been very stressed um haven't been stressed at all pretty much i've also been surprisingly surprisingly productive in like studying my french and my spanish and my not so much my asl but studied some asl today and whatever i've been like extra productive and um i've also been getting like lot of sleep because my classes am at like 1100 am and so wake up at like 900 am and you know like study french and spanish for little while eat breakfast like clean my room blah blah blah blah basically like i'm living like the perfect life right now and don't understand why and feel like it can't last for some reason and i'm just like waiting for the other shoe to drop or something like i've been getting so much sleep this can't continue right like how could it continue don't know but anyway um yeah i've been practicing lot of french and spanish which i'm very happy about started doing duolingo with them where like do duolingo from french to spanish which is surprisingly fun for me like think it really really fun anway have no classes tomorrow also have no classes friday so i'm probably just gonna like study some french and then do all of my homework or try most of my homework don't know i'm chilling mostly like villain have to have like call with my um what is she called my academic advisor which i'm annoyed about because told them that didn't need to meet but she refuses to listen to me so she making me meet anyway or she making me call anyway and yeah that bothers me but other than that um life is pretty great at the moment life is pretty much perfect at the moment and um i'm going to sleep goodnight 
149,so i'm very angry with myself right now because just remembered that actually have work at 800 am and forgot so uh it 100 am which means i'm only gonna get like six hours of sleep which is annoying but means it you know it the life i'm living now so um had good day today had pretty social day like really like one-on-one social day usually when i'm like socializing with my friend we're in the ooh friend we're in like large group like you know like five or six of us or something but today had um dinner with just one of my friend like one-on-one and then also went to meeting with someone from debate not meeting but like meeting you know but not like or yeah it was like we was having like discussion about like elections for debate um yeah and besides that spent lot of time like well spent some time in my room slept pretty late today 'cause was mad 'cause i've been waking up like kind of early for the past like week which just don't like doing means it fine but prefer sleeping in especially when don't have class so forced myself to sleep longer today anyway i'm really tired and i'm really upset that i'm only gonna get like five hours and ninety and 50 minutes of sleep so am going to hang up on you now good night 
150,okay had good day for today except it didn't start out too good because woke up really early because had to go to work which was really unfortunate but it okay um didn't do as much work as should have done today like didn't get as much homework [slash] productive [inaudible] [hmm] [that okay to because] [inaudible] so who gives fuck um other things did today um we held surprise birthday party for my friend which was really fun was the one in charge of bringing her down and did did good uh job it was really good um yeah and that surprise birthday party was fun after that got like mean during that and after that got very drunk i'm still vaguely drunk kinda [do need] to sleep now um yeah it just been nice good day didn't do much work but took nap um did some work applied for some funding uh i'm i'm having life whole life i'm kind of worried about like studying abroad this summer because really really wanna go i'm scared that i'm not gonna get it but it [doesn't] matter shouldn't worry 'cause probably will get it right don't know anyway um [i have life] i'm going to bed now good night see you later bye-bye 
151,okay so i'm gonna make this fast because i'm really tired and it really late and i'm ready to sleep um had good day today woke up really late later than usual like closed my blinds so that would sleep later than usually do and when woke up went to um lunch with my friend [redacted] which was really nice was at lunch with her for like two hours and then she walked me um to my work because had to work afterwards at work did like almost nothing like chilled mostly um but started filling out an application one of my [four] apps that i'm trying to finish and um yeah and then came back to my dorm or went had dinner with two of my friend actually three of my friend actually then came back to my dorm worked on homework for long time and then just spent the last three hours or four hours twisting my hair um watched netflix while did it so that like yeah [so that] watched netflix in french so could like practice my french at the same time but also had something to do instead of just like just wasting my time um but really wanted to twist my hair and completely detangle it and put nice stuff in it to moisturize it and so that what did and now i'm going to sleep barely before 500 am i'm mess good night 
152,okay so today had pretty productive day woke up at almost noon but pretty much finished like almost everything that needed to finish this weekend like spent most of the day doing my french homework but did finish it and then did like um just like i've been filling out applications for both of my for both summer opportunities and funding for the summer opportunities um so like did some more funding applications and then had to um what that thing called started two applications one for being [inaudible] and one for um the let go summer thing which is something that might do if don't get um study abroad don't get enough money for study abroad um so yeah um like had lunch and dinner with friends today and after um after finished my french homework went to brain break and spent uh like from brain break which was at 900 900 until like 230 am with my two of my friends who was just like studying together or like not studying together never know if should put it as studying together we was studying in the same room but we was studying separately like studying different thing but we was in the same room and sometimes we would talk um yeah anyway it was good productive day i'm going to bed now probably should've gone to bed earlier but you know just love to ruin my own life anyway good night 
153,okay so don't know why but have been feeling kind of sad for the past two days like today not like all days long but just like at random times would suddenly feel sad for no discernible reason like today skipped work bef cause of it think it might be because of the stress of um debate we're do having our debate elections and everyone just like kind of seems to be very on edge which is not life that like to live also think our applications for like summer things and funding is also stressing me out feel like just sort of have this like constant voice in our head that telling me that i'm running out of times uh anyway i'm going to go to bed today there was debate meeting but it was more like socialization meeting which was nice so just walked around and talked to everyone also spent lot of times like in [redacted] someone actually asked me if ever [inaudible] [redacted] today which thought was funny um yeah didn't get enough sleep last night which think might be why was little unhappy today but i'm going to bed now and will be waking up at like 900 am so hopefully that'll be fine okay goodnight now 
154,okay so today had good day um didn't finish my feel like okay so feel like haven't been as productive as usual don't know if it just 'cause didn't get headstart like usually at the beginning of the semester like take time to like do all of my homework like in advance like not all of it but like significant portion of my homework in advance and feel like for the past couple of day i've been doing my homework like the night before it was due think that mostly because it like my french homework and my french homework is to read book but still that troubles me don't like uh that feeling because it [more like] it like i'm always rushing to finish my homework so tomorrow um have french class and don't have french class till monday so think i'm going to try to get ahead on the book my only troubles is that read so fucking slow in french but whatever um other than that had good day today went to work um started one of my class um which have my friend in it um oh this things like turning off that annoying um and will mean like went and bought my book for for my expos class went to work didn't get to do homework at work today 'cause my boss asked me to do actual work which was shocked and confused about 'cause usually do no work like no real work do like homework when i'm at work instead um it is 141 pm and meant to go to bed at like 100 but then started having dance party alone in my room and then went to my roommate room to have dance party with her too so yeah um i'm little [inaudible] from that and now i'm going to bed for real for real um so good night 
155,okay so had good day today um okay so like woke up late because was super tired went to class realized that need to like take an art class or do something because i've been drawing on my papers far too much also i'm slightly behind in my french class which is worrying but will fix that tomorrow so anyway um yeah went to class um did my um had meeting with uh the person who is running for president on the debate team um went to my other class think which is sea monsters which is lot of fun um and then was actually productive in that finished my what appli what let go application is what it was called my let go application um um which is thing think might want to do this summer if like don't get to study abroad so yeah um i'm glad finished it finally and then after finished it went to work did like [inaudible] homework and after work was walking home and um and got message from my friend that was like we're in like blah blah blah room come and hang out with us so went there and like bunch of my friend was there and we just stayed up until like 300 am talking and whatnot and it was lot of fun that was lot of fun um i'm feeling uh vaguely upset right now wasn't feeling upset all day but now i'm feeling little upset because like debate is just really like bothering us there is just lot of issues with the um debate team when it come to like exclusivity and just like don't know like cherry-picking novices and it just really really annoying shit and really hope it stops and we have elections coming up soon and i'm scared of how the results is gonna go anyway i'm going to um bed now goodnight sleep tight 
156,okay so had good day today except for like the end of the day but anyway today woke up late went to one class after my class um went to work was also unusually productive today um before and then after work like finished most of my finished decent amount of my work like worked on the [path] application lot went through some emails and stuff so was very proud of myself productivity-wise and then went to debate social and it was actually the saddest and most dep uncomfortable debate social that we've ever had and i'm just i'm really upset about debate lately for lot of different reasons um and it really just like so fucking annoying um yeah so that was really upset about me upsetting me today especially after debate social um and just some stuff that happened at the debate social me and two of my friends went back to my room after debate social and we talked for long time and just don't know it made me feel better especially when it understand the plight of like being on the debate team but whatever okay [day] [okay i'm] oh my god just wanna like just want elections to be over kinda wanna drop out of debate kinda wanna die don't know but have work tomorrow and by tomorrow mean today in less than six hours which mean have less than five hours to sleep and am going to bed now good night

161,okay so today had better day than day have been as of late like i'm i'm star think i'm starting to get back on track um i'm not don't 100 have my life back together but it getting there you know cleaned my room um did most of my french homework can finish the rest tomorrow think hope maybe um so yeah it yeah i'm just gonna go to bed now i'm tired didn't do much today like went to work and went to class and then did work and then went back to work and then home and started reading downloaded bunch of french books to my computer so that can read them and practice translating because want to be translator and interpreter when i'm older um and what else oh um what was gonna say oh um sort of almost fell down today because feel like i've been letting like just life get away from me like just like do my homework or like do my homework and then go to class and when go to work and go to debate and when i'm done with all these things i'm so tired that don't wanna study french or spanish or sign language and don't like that don't like that feeling that i'm not improving on the skills that want to improve on so think i'm gonna make myself schedule like and put it on my bedroom wall and just allot specific times each day for me to do the things that want to do um because you know think you should take care of yourself first okay goodnight 
162,so had totally jam-packed day today like woke up went to french class then went to um the dining hall and did my homework for like two hours then went to um different class and then after class after my second class for the day it was like 530 pm literally spent seven hours doing debate things or yeah seven hours so like went to dinner with the friend of the president of the debate team and um to talk about cases and stuff and then went to um debate practice round and then went to meeting for debate and then went to another debate practice round and then me and my friend prepped for debate that took until like 100 am it now 434 am just finished reading my book for class that was gonna have to finish for tomorrow i'm super tired will be so fucked up in the morning but i'm going to sleep now um yeah anyway it was productive day guess so that good good night

192,okay okay so am home now in florida spent the day out spent like the first half of the day traveling to florida so didn't go to sleep last night went to the airport at er my flight left at 600 am so was at the airport at like 400 um and then um got to florida at 1200 just slept on the plane and just sat in the airport and did nothing and ate and watched netflix and then when got home um pretty quickly went to sleep and i've been sleeping most of the day did um watch some netflix and play the sims little bit and other than that took like like slept on the both plane rides here had two flight took like slept for like three hours wait no yeah almost three hours when got here think and then took another like two-hour nap later now am going to bed good night 
193,okay so feel like when i'm in florida enter this like zone of existence where am not motivated to do any-anything at all except watch netflix on my phone or play the sims even though hate the game the sims and it total waste of time so that what i've been doing all day today like woke up at noon actually no did nothing today 'cause woke up at noon sorry have the hiccups woke up at noon like watched netflix then played the simms then took nap like took nap after doing nothing um but then after my nap it was like 600 pm and went to the movies with my mom and then after that we went to dinner so that was nice we saw black panther which was really good and we went to the cheesecake factory which love and then we stopped by my grandma hotel to visit my grandma yeah and now it is nighttime and should go to bed but think i'm gonna play the simms anyway um because hate myself maybe don't know um okay yeah that it and really did not much today not much at all except to like until my mom took me out so uh oh my god goo 
194,okay so again because am at home in florida spent the entire day doing absolutely nothing i'm actually feeling kinda gross 'cause didn't shower either um but today the last day um again watched lot of netflix played lot of sims and i'm done now at least i'm done playing sims 'cause hate that game and it also waste of my time so tomorrow i'm making plans to be not productive but at least not bum hope to wake up at 1130 um shower wash my fucking face sorry for the swearing and like eat right now that one of my goals was my goals oh maybe read part of my book for french don't know just can't lay in bed slash on the couch for the rest of my life which is what did today entirely the only reason woke up today is 'cause my grandparents came over to see me which was really nice so talked like woke up at noon right before it was about to leave spoke to them for little bit went to visit my brother school um and then what it called went back to bed no went back to my room and played sims and then went to bed and then when woke up it was like 600 pm and so yeah i'm bum and hate when do this just hate the game sims wish would do like literally anything else with my time like maybe something productive but also probably relaxing like this like extremely hard is good for me probably hope anyway um this isn't relevant to my day today but i've come up with plans to live in the van in van in the distant future sorry if i'm talking weird i'm like rubbing my face which is probably not good for my eyes but whatever um in the distant future [inaudible] distant future hopefully being immediately after college but possibly not being because will need money to buy van want to live in van tr uh like just drive around the united states canada other places if available and yeah that it just wanna live in van not like normal like soccer mom van like large van like sprinter van like van that can stand up in um i've made i've thought about this lot i've told everyone that know about how want to live in van most people am supportive which is good uh yeah and dream about it lot just really really wanna do it good night 
195,um so was supposed to go home tomorrow as in later today guess but today found out from american airlines that due to the weather think they just canceled my flight to [redacted] so now instead of leaving on tuesday i'm leaving on thursday that pretty much the only news that got today other than that again spent large amount of time in bed actually spent less time in bed today and more time on the couch um actually got up and showered so that was good um and after you know taking my midmorning or actually not mid-midmorning 'cause didn't wake up in the morning after taking my midday nap went and sat on the couch for the rest of the night and did nothing productive not even for second except for when like called american airlines to get later flight um but that they yeah and now they is 300 in the morning and i'm going to sleep and hope that can wake up at reasonable hour good night 
196,okay so today had good day um think these recordings feel like are so boring when i'm on meds like when go ho-home because don't do anything when i'm at home literally like woke up at noon sat on the couch for the entire day and did nothing else like there was literally nothing um i've been texting my friends lately like rec like lately as in like for the past couple of hours [basically] what i've been doing like literally there like really nothing to tell um as in no homework watched netflix took nap on the couch tried to play the sims and then stopped after two minutes which are good that means i'm getting bored of the game because hate that game and didn't wanna keep playing it um yeah and now i'm gonna try i'm gonna try going to sleep actually i'm gonna try masturbating and then i'm gonna try going to sleep um yeah good night 
197,okay so um today was my most productive day in while still did no homework but actually um also still woke up at noon but cleaned my room sweeped and everything and packed my suitcase because tomorrow um at 600 am have to get up shower and then go to the airport um because i'm flying back to [redacted] which i'm very excited about um and just hope my plane isn't delayed also my period started today think and hope it stops because i'm supposed to go to someone house tomorrow after get back and that would be really unfortunate um if couldn't go so yeah that pretty much it um didn't do much today again woke up at noon took nap too that just like my lifestyle while i'm here which is probably like really boring and it is really boring and it feels boring but that what do i'm going to bed now good night actually no i'm not i'm gonna watch netflixs and then i'm going to go to bed good 
198,so got back to harvard today which was nice um i'm little bit slightly upset because was supposed to like after getting back go to someone house um but got my period got my period yesterday but was hoping that it would be like don't know it would stop because sometimes it just does that and don't know maybe should go to the doctor anyway but it didn't stop so can't go to their house [i don't know what wanna do] don't know have to wait till like saturday or sunday or something whenever it ends um yeah which is unfortunate but um besides that did like nothing today wo got no sleep last night slept for literally exactly an hour fell asleep try to go to bed at like 100 am and gave up tried again at 200 gave up tried again at 300 gave up finally fell asleep at like 500 am woke up had to get up at 600 to get dressed and go to the airport um finally got and then got to harvard why does you turn off like that that annoying got to harvard at like 500 pm so that was great um slept on the planes but while was in the airport read my friend book which uh honestly probably should've finished early probably should've procrastinated less while was in florida but florida was very relaxing and i'm don't know feeling rejuvenated am don't know maybe i'm making that up anyway i've made schedule for myself tomorrow so i'm going to be super super productive tomorrow hope and yeah and now i'm going to bed i'm ge have to wake up early because have to renew my passport tomorrow and want to go to the post office early and get it over with in case it takes takes like long time if there line of something okay good night
